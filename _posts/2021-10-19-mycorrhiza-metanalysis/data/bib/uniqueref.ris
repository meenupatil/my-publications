AB  - An investigation was carried out to evaluate the response of selected species of mycorrhizae for nutrient acquisition and phosphorus uptake by maize in an alluvial soils of Bihar. The study was undertaken during 2013 wet season (July to December) in a net-house at Bihar Agricultural University. Six treatments along with a control treatment were maintained with three replications for the experiment. Five species of AM fungi collected from TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute) along with a local species from long term litchi orchard (Muzaffarpur), were evaluated on the basis of nutrient acquisition in the soil rhizospeheric region for maize crop. The results obtained clearly show that of all the species of mycorrhizae taken under consideration, Glomus mosseae was found to perform better in terms of nutrient acquisition and uptake of P to plant. The maximum P concentration (7.65 mg kg-1), organic carbon (0.60%) and Zn Concentration (6.48 mg kg-1) and P uptake (was also found with the application of G. mosseae. The AM (Arbuscular Mycorrhiza) species significantly increased the released of P and micronutrients in the soil of rhizospheric region of maize plant. The beneficial effect was more pronounced for the treatment in case of Glomus mossae among all the other species used. This may be due to the higher solubilization power of Glomus mossae for soil nutrients than other species. Article History Correspondence to Keywords

AB  - Background: Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi increase seedling survival and performance through enhancement of nutrient and water uptake under stress conditions. Acacia etbaica, A. senegal and Boswellia papyrifera dominate large areas in African drylands where both moisture and nutrients are limited. Aims: We evaluated the effects of AM, drought and soil quality on carbon gain (growth), gas exchange and nutrient contents of seedlings of these three dry woodland species. Methods: We used a greenhouse experiment with a fully factorial design of two levels of AM, two levels of soil and four levels of water availability, on the carbon gain, gas exchange and nutrient content of seedlings of the three species. Results: AM symbiosis enhanced the acquisition of water and nutrients and increased gas exchange resulting in increased Acacia and Boswellia seedling biomass. The rapidly growing Acacia species (acquisitive strategy) showed larger mycor-rhizal benefit at higher water availability. The slow-growing Boswellia (conservative strategy), in contrast, showed larger mycorrhizal benefit at lower water availability. Conclusions: This study showed that different species of dry woodlands benefit from AM in different ways depending on the resource use strategy under stress conditions. The inclusion of the mycorrhizal habit in trait-based approaches increases understanding of functional differences of coexisting tree species.

AB  - Although there is a growing amount of evidence that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) influence the decomposition process, the extent of their involvement remains unclear. Therefore, given this knowledge gap, our aim was to test how AMF influence the soil decomposer communities. Dual compartment microcosms, where AMF (Glomus mosseae) were either allowed access (AM+) to or excluded (AM-) from forest soil compartments containing litterbags (leaf litter from Calophyllum polyanthum) were used. The experiment ran for six months, with destructive harvests at 0, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days. For each harvest we measured AMF colonization, soil nutrients, litter mass loss, and microbial biomass (using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA)). AMF significantly enhanced litter decomposition in the first 5 months, whilst delaying the development of total microbial biomass (represented by total PLFA) from T-150 to T-180. A significant decline in soil available N was observed through the course of the experiment for both treatments. This study shows that AMF have the capacity to interact with soil microbial communities and inhibit the development of fungal and bacterial groups in the soil at the later stage of the litter decomposition (180 days), whilst enhancing the rates of decomposition.

AB  - \textcopyright} 2019 The Author(s). Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are widespread in terrestrial ecosystems. In addition to their contributions to plant nutrient uptake, AMF also provide many ecological functions including regulation of soil C dynamics. However, both stimulating and retarding soil organic decomposition by AMF have been observed. Here we discuss the possible reasons for such a contradiction. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi contribute to soil aggregation mainly through hyphal enmeshment, saprotrophic suppression, and production of glomalin-related soil proteins, while AMF can also stimulate organic decomposition through promoting degradative enzymes, modifying root production and activity, and/or through regulating the microbial community in the mycorrhizosphere and hyphosphere. The role of AMF in C decomposition is strongly dependent on the quality and quantity of different soil C pools. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can stimulate fresh residue decomposition initially through stimulating the decomposition of fresh residues (particularly those having high C/N ratio), whereas for older or decomposed soil organic C, AMF tend to suppress decomposition by promoting soil aggregation. Under elevated CO2 (eCO2), AMF show additive effects on residue decomposition, priming effects, and changes in soil aggregation. Despite organic decomposition rates differing in the short term and long term following litter experiments, our discussion highlights the role of AMF in organic C dynamics. We hypothesize that AMF would benefit soil C gain in the long term and thereby predict that disturbances that impacts negatively on AMF, such as tillage, residue burning, fertilization, and fungicide application, would lead to soil C decline particularly under eCO2

AB  - Recent changes in the species diversity and sporocarp production of ectomycorrhizal fungi in different regions of, and forest communities within, Europe are discussed with special emphasis on events in The Netherlands. In some forests in some regions fewer ectomycorrhizal fungi are now producing sporocarps, notably those associated with trees more than 40 years old and in particular conifers, for instance species of Phellodon, Hydnellum, Suillus, Tricholoma and Cortinarius. It is argued that this decline in different parts of Europe is coincident with decreased numbers of mycorrhizas. A scheme of progressive changes with three phases of ectomycorrhizal impoverishment and seven subphases is presented. The more probable causes of decline are discussed, namely forest succession, the collection of sporocarps (of edible mycorrhizal fungi), changes in forest management, direct influences of air pollutants, acidification of forest soils and consequent increased availability of aluminium in soil solution, nitrogen deposition, increased litter accumulation, changes in the herb layer of forests and reduced tree vitality. It is argued that changes in the populations of ectomycorrhizal fungi are most likely to be attributable to indirect effects of air pollution, in particular to increases in amounts of available nitrogen (possibly in combination with acidification) and/or to decreased tree vitality wity consequent reductions in the transport of current assimilates to roots and mycorrhizas. The relative importance of these different factors, and their interactions, are likely to differ in different locations. It is supposed that liming and applications of other corrective fertilizers are unlikely to restore the diversity and sporocarp production of ectomycorrhizal fungi; they may even have adverse effects. In the circumstances therefore it seems that the abatement of emissions is likely to be the only effective way of improving and sustaining stable forest ecosystems in areas at risk, notably in densely populated Europe. {\textcopyright} 1991.

AB  - Livestock production in Latin America has replaced tropical dry forests with conventional monocultures pastures (CP) that have degraded soils. As an alternative to CP, intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS) have been developed with multi-canopied vegetation that mimics native forest (F). The litter inputs and year-round presence of the tree rhizosphere in ISS, contribute to the formation of ``fertile islands,{''} which is expected to impact biological activity and crop productivity. This study, investigated the impact of the conversion of CP to ISS, as well as the effect of canopy of Prosopis juliflora trees in a chronosequence of ISS (3-15 years) on soil microbial communities and the physicochemical properties of soil. FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) profiles indicated that soil microbial community structure and composition shifted depending on land management systems. CP promoted the dominance of G(-) bacteria, while 155 chronosequence and F favored actinomycetes and fungal biomass (total and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). In addition, soil microbial community (FAME profiles) of ISS chronosequence and F were more similar than with CP. An increase in the Cy/pre FAME ratio in CP suggested that the microbial community was under higher stress. The advantage of including trees in pasture systems was reinforced by the observation that FAME biomarkers, enzymatic activities and nutrient status were significantly higher beneath the canopy of P. juliflora. The results indicate that ISS are viable alternatives for improving soil quality and metabolic function, which is reflected in the significant increase in microbial biomass, FAME biomarkers and enzyme activities compared with CP.

AB  - Symbiotic di-nitrogen (N2) fixation is a critical biogeochemical process in tropical forests, yet it remains unresolved how fixation is controlled by the availability of soil nitrogen and phosphorus, two nutrients often considered limiting in terrestrial ecosystems. We examine whether individual N2-fixing trees can overcome nitrogen and phosphorus constraints by employing different strategies of nutrient acquisition and use: N2 fixation, phosphatase exudation, mycorrhizal symbiosis and changes in root-shoot ratio or tissue stoichiometry. We grew a common and widespread N2 fixer, Inga punctata, in a full factorial nitrogen and phosphorus addition experiment (each nutrient at three levels) and evaluated whether trees adjusted their strategies of nutrient acquisition to overcome limitation. N2 fixation was controlled by nitrogen availability in phosphorus-sufficient soils, but both fixation and plant growth were constrained by phosphorus in the unamended native phosphorus-poor soils. Despite the investment in both extracellular phosphatases and mycorrhizal symbionts, plants were unable to overcome phosphorus limitation. Our findings support the hypotheses that: (i) N2 fixation is proximately controlled by nitrogen availability, consistent with a facultative fixation strategy, and (ii) N2 fixation and N2 fixer biomass growth are ultimately constrained by soil phosphorus. We found no support for the hypothesis that fixers can overcome phosphorus limitation by trading fixed N2 for soil phosphorus. Synthesis. This study provides new knowledge about how nitrogen and phosphorus interact to regulate tropical N2 fixation by examining a suite of strategies that plants may employ to overcome nutrient limitation. These findings, focused at the organismal level, have broader implications for biogeochemical controls at the ecosystem level in tropical forests.

AB  - Bacteria and fungi drive the cycling of plant litter in forests, but little is known about their role in tropical rain forest nutrient cycling, despite the high rates of litter decay observed in these ecosystems. However, litter decay rates are not uniform across tropical rain forests. For example, decomposition can differ dramatically over small spatial scales between low-diversity, monodominant rain forests, and species-rich, mixed forests. Because the climatic patterns and soil parent material are identical in co-occurring mixed and monodominant forests, differences in forest floor accumulation, litter production, and decomposition between these forests may be biotically mediated. To test this hypothesis, we conducted field and laboratory studies in a monodominant rain forest in which the ectomycorrhizal tree Dicymbe corymbosa forms > 80\% of the canopy, and a diverse, mixed forest dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. After 2 years, decomposition was significantly slower in the monodominant forest (P < 0.001), but litter production was significantly greater in the mixed forest (P < 0.001). In the laboratory, we found microbial community biomass was greater in the mixed forest (P = 0.02), and the composition of fungal communities was distinct between the two rain forest types (P = 0.001). Sequencing of fungal rDNA revealed a significantly lower richness of saprotrophic fungi in the monodominant forest (19 species) relative to the species-rich forest (84 species); moreover, only 4\% percent of fungal sequences occurred in both forests. These results show that nutrient cycling patterns in tropical forests can vary dramatically over small spatial scales, and that changes in microbial community structure likely drive the observed differences in decomposition.

AB  - Soil microorganisms can make up more than 95% of the total soil biomass, and plays important role in decomposition of carbon sources and organic matter. Forest management practices (e.g., harvesting, burning, and thinning) influence the composition of the soil microbial community by affecting habitat and substrate for soil microorganisms directly and indirectly, and hence affect soil carbon process. Quantifying the responses of the soil microbial community to forest management is vital to accurately evaluate forest carbon balance and to reveal the underlying mechanisms of soil carbon process change. Thus, an aerially seeded Pinus massoniana forest was chosen in the Three Gorges reservoir area to evaluate the effects on soil microbial community owing to different forest management practices (i.e., control; shrub-removal: harvesting all shrubs and removing all harvest residues. Harvest strategy 1: 15% harvest intensity and removing main harvest residues without leaves and small branches; Harvest strategy 2: 70% harvest intensity and the same harvest residue management as that in harvest 1). All experimental treatments were located in similar habitats and consisted of three 20 m × 20 m plots. The treatments were conducted in October 2013, and soil samples were collected in December 2013 (2 months post treatments) and December 2014 (12 months post treatments) to analyze soil microbial community by using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) methods, and analyze soil chemical properties. The results showed that the total microbial biomass and biomass of all microbial species (except arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) in shrub-removal, harvest strategy 1 and harvest strategy 2 were lower than those of the control in December 2014. However, there was no consistent rule observed in December 2013. Principal component analysis indicated that all treatments showed no significant change in soil microbial community structure in December 2013; the 2 principal component factors related to microbial community diversity explained 60.90% and 17.40% of the variation respectively. Shrub-removal, harvest strategy 1 and harvest strategy 2 did significantly affect soil microbial community structure in December 2014, and the 2 principal component factors related to microbial community diversity explained 50.40% and 26.70% of the variation respectively. In 2013, 5 PLFAs (Mel 16:0, 16: 1w5c, 16: 1w7c, al17:0 and 20: 1w9c) played a major role in the first principal component, and 7 PLFAs (Mel16:0, 16:1w5c, 14:0, 16:0, cy17:0, 16:1w7c, i14:0) played a major role in the first principal component in 2014. The fungi (20: 1w9c) PLFAs played the most significant role in the first principal component in 2013 and was replaced by gram negative bacteria (16:1w7c) PLFAs in 2014. Soil moisture, ratio of soil temperature and soil moisture, and soil microbial quotient (ratio of soil microbial biomass carbon and soil organic carbon) were significant factors regulating soil microbial community structure at different treatment times (P < 0.05), as revealed by redundancy analysis (RDA). {\textcopyright} 2018 Science Press.

AB  - Biochar is gaining increasing attention in the fields of forest rehabilitation, agriculture, etc. For evaluating biochar application to improve the rhizosphere environment of Japanese black pine (Pinus thunbergii) at harsh coastal environments, a pot experiment was carried out with a focus on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis and water relations of seedlings. Another characteristic recently observed at coastal forests is the invasion of the locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), which can potentially increase soil nitrogen. In this study, four treatments were examined (biochar addition, litter addition, biochar and litter addition, and no addition [control]) to determine the effects of biochar and/or nitrogen-rich locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) litter application. Although effects of biochar and litter addition were not observed on ECM symbiosis rate and species composition, treatments with biochar addition, maintained xylem water potential (XWP) of needles for up to 2 weeks without irrigation, independent of litter addition. As biochar increased relative fine root biomass (fine root biomass/total root biomass), it can be considered that biochar was able to maintain needle XWP through increasing the relative amount of fine roots that can obtain water. Overall, these findings suggest that biochar application can help to maintain water relations of Japanese black pine by enhancing fine root growth. {\textcopyright} 2020, {\textcopyright} 2020 The Japanese Forest Society.

AB  - Natural abundances of N-15 and N concentrations of 34 fruit bodies from 24 species of ectomycorrhizal and saprophytic fungi were measured in a temperate Central European mixed forest stand. The fungi of the two life forms are known to be capable of utilizing different types of N sources (organic N compounds from the humus, inorganic N from the soil and N from litter or wood) differing by their N-15 natural abundance values. Based on the two life forms and the three different N sources, four functional groups of fungi were distinguished: (1) ectomycorrhizal fungi capable of utilizing organic N from the humus; (2) ectomycorrhizal fungi known to depend on inorganic N compounds in the soil; (3) saprophytes capable of utilizing organic N from the humus; and (4) saprophytes utilizing N from dead wood or litter. Large differences were found between species in the delta(15)N values (-3.0 to 3.3 parts per thousand,) and in the N concentrations (0.84 to 6.61 mmol eq N g dw(-1)) of the fruit bodies. In most cases fungi were more enriched in N-15 than their respective bulk N source was. Fungi living in humus, and presumably having access to organic N compounds (groups 1 and 3), were significantly more enriched in N-15 than fungi which are known to depend on inorganic N (e.g. Laccaria, group 2), or fungi living on litter or wood (group 4), irrespective of whether they were ectomycorrhizal or saprophytic species. Fungi living in humus had significantly higher N concentrations than fungi living on litter or wood.

AB  - Background and objectives: aggregation and structure play key roles in the water-holding capacity and stability of soils and are important for the physical protection and storage of soil carbon (C). Forest soils are an important sink of ecosystem C, though the capacity to store C may be disrupted by the elevated atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) compounds by dispersion of soil aggregates via acidification or altered microbial activity. Furthermore, dominant tree species and the lability of litter they produce can influence aggregation processes. Materials and methods: we measured water-stable aggregate size distribution and aggregate-associated organic matter (OM) content in soils from two watersheds and beneath four hardwood species at the USDA Forest Service Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA, where one watershed has received (NH4)2SO4 fertilizer since 1989 and one is a reference/control of similar stand age. Bulk soil OM, pH, and permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) were also measured. Research highlights: fertilized soil exhibited decreased macro-aggregate formation and a greater proportion of smaller micro-aggregates or unassociated clay minerals, particularly in the B-horizon. This shift in aggregation to soil more dominated by the smallest (<53 µm) fraction is associated with both acidification (soil pH) and increased microbially processed C (POXC) in fertilized soil. Intra-aggregate OM was also depleted in the fertilized soil (52% less OM in the 53–2000 µm fractions), most strongly in subsurface B-horizon soil. We also document that tree species can influence soil aggregation, as soil beneath species with more labile litter contained more OM in the micro-aggregate size class (<250 µm), especially in the fertilized watershed, while species with more recalcitrant litter promoted more OM in the macroaggregate size classes (500–2000 µm) in the reference watershed. Conclusions: long-term fertilization, and likely historic atmospheric deposition, of forest soils has weakened macro-aggregation formation, with implications for soil stability, hydrology, and storage of belowground C. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Although it is increasingly being recognized that roots play a key role in soil carbon (C) dynamics, the magnitude and direction of these effects are unknown. Roots can accelerate soil C losses by provisioning microbes with energy to decompose organic matter or impede soil C losses by enhancing microbial competition for nutrients. We experimentally reduced belowground C supply to soils via tree girdling, and contrasted responses in control and girdled plots for three consecutive growing seasons. We hypothesized that decreases in belowground C supply would have stronger effects in plots dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees rather than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees. In ECM-dominated plots, girdling decreased the activity of enzymes that break down soil organic matter (SOM) by c. 40\%, indicating that, in control plots, C supply from ECM roots primes microbial decomposition. In AM-dominated plots, girdling had little effect on SOM-degrading enzymes, but increased the decomposition of AM leaf litter by c. 43\%, suggesting that, in control plots, AM roots may intensify microbial competition for nutrients. Our findings indicate that root-induced changes in soil processes depend on forest composition, and that shifts in the distribution of AM and ECM trees owing to climate change may determine soil C gains and losses.

AB  - The reproductive processes and environmental requirements for regenerating Betula alleghaniensis, B. papyrifera, B. pendula, and B. pubescens are reviewed. Their taxonomy is confusing because somatic chromosome number varies within species, and natural hybridization is common. Paper birch and the Eurasian birches are typical species of the boreal forest, whereas yellow birch grows no farther north than 49°, from Manitoba and Minnesota eastward across North America, and somewhat farther south than paper birch. Birches do not tolerate shade, except that seedlings prosper best at about half of full sunlight, and can endure up to 90% shade. Long photoperiods are required for genetic sources from high latitudes and from high altitudes. Growth is optimum at about 18°-22°C soil and air temperatures. The birches do not use water efficiently and are sensitive to both drought and flooding. They require fertile sites for best growth and are particularly sensitive to available soil phosphorus. The response of birch to soil chemistry is genetically variable. The birches improve soils by cycling nutrients efficiently, conveying oxygen to the rooting profile, and improving soil structure and permeability. The Eurasian birches from mycorrhizal relationships with many symbionts that markedly improve growth and survival. The mycorrhizal relationships of the North American birches are meagerly documented. Birch roots adapt to difficult conditions. Roots proliferate in the upper soil, but sinkers penetrate deep soil and restrictive layers. Rootlets develop best in organic matter and penetrate decayed wood. Birch seedlings typically grow only about 1 dm tall the first year, so they are easily suppressed by faster-growing and allelochemic vegetation. Many animals, large and small, can hinder regeneration by browsing seedlings or eating seed. Fire can easily kill mature birch, but prepares good seedbeds. Surviving birches produce stress seed crops and coppice to enable regeneration. The birches begin producing seed when 10-15 years old. Seed quality is usually higher in years with warm springs and abundant flowering. The seed ripens in late summer to early autumn and disperses mostly within a few months. Less than 10% of the seed is dispersed farther than 100 m. Birch seed can retain some viability in the forest floor for up to 3 years. The birch seed-coat contains a germination inhibitor that can be neutralized by stratification or by light. Germination is generally best at about 20°-30°C and under blue-green to red wavelengths. Undisturbed litter seedbeds are too hot and dry, and physically hinder birch germination and establishment. Seedlings establish best on disturbed seedbeds consisting of mixed mineral soil and organic matter, decayed wood in particular. Burned-over humus seedbeds are overly hot and dry, and may require several years before they can support birch seedlings. In contrast, peat or Sphagnum seedbeds may remain receptive for many years. {\textcopyright} 1990.

AB  - The ability of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal 'Elliott' highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) plants to acquire soil N under different preplant organic soil amendment regimes (forest litter, rotted sawdust, or no amendment) was investigated in a field experiment using 15N labeled (NH4)2SO4. Plants inoculated with an ericoid mycorrhizal isolate, Oidiodendron maius Dalp{\'{e}} (UAMH 9263), had lower leaf 15N enrichment and higher leaf N contents than noninoculated plants but similar leaf N concentrations, indicating mycorrhizal plants absorbed more nonlabeled soil N than nonmycorrhizal plants. Mycorrhizal plants produced more plant dry weight (DW) and larger canopy volumes. The effect of preplant organic amendments on the growth of highbush blueberry plants was clearly demonstrated. Plants grown in soil amended with forest litter produced higher DW than those in either the rotted sawdust amendment or no amendment. Plants grown in soils amended preplant with sawdust, the current commercial recommendation, were the smallest. Differences in the carbon to nitrogen ratio were likely responsible for growth differences among plants treated with different soil amendments.

AB  - Pyrogenic savannas with a tree–grassland ‘matrix' experience frequent fires (i.e. every 1–3 yr). Aboveground responses to frequent fires have been well studied, but responses of fungal litter decomposers, which directly affect fuels, remain poorly known. We hypothesized that each fire reorganizes belowground communities and slows litter decomposition, thereby influencing savanna fuel dynamics. In a pine savanna, we established patches near and away from pines that were either burned or unburned in that year. Within patches, we assessed fungal communities and microbial decomposition of newly deposited litter. Soil variables and plant communities were also assessed as proximate drivers of fungal communities. Fungal communities, but not soil variables or vegetation, differed substantially between burned and unburned patches. Saprotrophic fungi dominated in unburned patches but decreased in richness and relative abundance after fire. Differences in fungal communities with fire were greater in litter than in soils, but unaffected by pine proximity. Litter decomposed more slowly in burned than in unburned patches. Fires drive shifts between fire-adapted and sensitive fungal taxa in pine savannas. Slower fuel decomposition in accordance with saprotroph declines should enhance fuel accumulation and could impact future fire characteristics. Thus, fire reorganization of fungal communities may enhance persistence of these fire-adapted ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Intensive logging of Araucaria angustifolia has reduced the extension of Araucaria-dominated forests, causing a strong disturbance on the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community. AMF play an important role in soil health and Araucaria forest establishment. However, the main drivers that determine the AMF dynamics in native and reforested areas remain poorly understood. Our study aimed at evaluating important factors (i.e. soil and litter characteristics, seasonality and reforestation practices) that can alter AMF community dynamics. We evaluated three regions of Araucaria forest located in S{\~{a}}o Paulo state, Brazil, including native and reforested sites. We evaluated the AMF community through soil spore extraction and identification and root colonization rates, and we compiled the data using correlations and diversity metrics (richness, abundance and diversity). Together, we recorded thirty-six AMF species during the two sampling periods at all sites. Genera with the greatest numbers of species were Glomus, Acaulospora, Scutellospora and Gigaspora. Soil macroporosity, K and P were always higher in native forests and moisture was higher in reforested sites. Root colonization, though also affected by seasonality, showed differential behavior for each region. In addition, AMF species abundance changed between native and reforested sites and according to the season. In region 1, when correlating AMF and physical–chemical soil and litter attributes in a Redundancy Analysis, there were few differences between native and reforested sites, both being very similar. However, native and reforested sites were clearly discriminated in the other two regions, mainly influenced by bulk density, litter N, pH, Al, total porosity and moisture. The main influence in AMF dynamics composition were litter physical and chemical attributes. However, the reforestation process and seasonality, especially in summer, contributed to discriminate regions, indicating the relevance of these aspects on the AMF profile, reinforcing the importance of integrating tools in the evaluation of the biological data set. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Low molecular-weight phenolic acids have been found to leach in high amounts from various types of forest leaf litter. Different leaching patterns were established between litter from coniferous trees and litter from deciduous trees. An overview is given about the physiological impact of phenolic acids on plant development. By affecting ectomycorrhizal fungi, phenolics may influence the establishment and growth of tree seedlings. Polymeric phenols in forest leaf litter (hydrolyzable and condensed tannins) have a large influence on nutrient cycling in forests and thereby on the growth conditions of plants. The allelopathic potential of species by the action of low molecular-weight phenolic acids may be influenced by the humus form prevailing under the vegetation. Implications of monomeric and polymeric phenols for vegetation processes in forests are discussed. -from Author

AB  - Forest pests drive tree mortality through disruption of functional traits linked to nutrient acquisition, growth and reproduction. The impacts of attack by individual or multiple above-ground herbivores on root functional traits critical to tree health have received little attention. This is especially true for exotic herbivores, organisms often found in disturbed forests. We excavated whole-root systems from eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) individuals experimentally infested with hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA: Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (EHS: Fiorina externa) individually, or in combination, for periods of 2 and 4 years. Below-ground root biomass, functional traits and storage nutrients were measured to assess impacts of herbivory. We also quantified ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) colonisation of fine roots and used culture-independent methods to examine EMF diversity. Trees infested with HWA had a greater root mass fraction (root to total biomass ratio), although feeding had no observable effects on root functional traits (e.g. specific root length) or on resource allocation to roots. HWA feeding did significantly reduce EMF colonisation of hemlock fine roots, though surprisingly, EMF diversity and that of other fungal associates were unaffected. In contrast to HWA, EHS (alone or in conjunction with HWA) feeding had no observable effect on below-ground traits or EMF colonisation alone; however, its presence mediated HWA effects when trees were co-infested. Simultaneous infestation within the same year yielded significant reductions in EMF colonisation, whereas prior EHS attack weakened HWA effects. Our results collectively suggest that prior EHS attack dampens the impact of HWA on below-ground functional traits. This highlights how the timing and sequence of herbivore arrival can alter plant-mediated interactions between herbivores and their effects on above–below-ground linkages and associated tree health.

AB  - Enhancement of the atmospheric N deposition is a serious threat for the structure and function of ecosystems. Here we evaluate the ecological effects of excess N with respect to changes in vegetation and soil biota in a series of experiments along a N gradient across Europe. The aim of this project (NITREX: N saturation EXperiments) is to assess the risk of N saturation and the reversibility of N saturation. At the experimental sites with a low-to-moderate input, N was added (n = 3), while at sites with a high input, N was removed by means of a transparent roof (n = 4). The experiments started between 1989 and 1991. Across the N gradient a positive correlation was found between the N concentration in deposition or soil solution with the N concentration in the needles and in general a negative correlation with the base cations K and Mg. In the N-addition plots there was a tendency towards a decreasing nutrient status of the needles, whereas at one site N-removal led to an improvement. Addition of N hardly affected fine-root biomass production, whereas signs of growth increase were recorded when the input was reduced. Tree growth was accelerated upon input reduction at two of three sites. Manipulation of N input did not alter the decomposition rate, although significant differences between sites were noted. Manipulation of the N input hardly affected the biomass of fungi and bacteria, but a negative relation between the N-addition and part of the soil fauna may be present among sites.

AB  - Incident rainfall is a major source of nutrient input to a forest ecosystem and the consequent throughfall and stemflow contribute to nutrient cycling. These rain-based fluxes were measured over 12 mo in two forest types in Korup National Park, Cameroon, one with low (LEM) and one with high (HEM) ectomycorrhizal abundances of trees. Throughfall was 96.6 and 92.4\% of the incident annual rainfall (5370 mm) in LEM and HEM forests respectively; stemflow was correspondingly 1.5 and 2.2\%. Architectural analysis showed that ln(funneling ratio) declined linearly with increasing ln(basal area) of trees. Mean annual inputs of N, P, K, Mg and Ca in incident rainfall were 1.50, 1.07, 7.77, 5.25 and 9.27 kg ha(-1), and total rain-based inputs to the forest floor were 5.0, 3.2, 123.4, 14.4 and 37.7 kg ha-1 respectively. The value for K is high for tropical forests and that for N is low. Nitrogen showed a significantly lower loading of throughfall and stemflow in HEM than in LEM forest, this being associated in the HEM forest with a greater abundance of epiphytic bryophytes which may absorb more N. Incident rainfall provided c. 35\% of the gross input of P to the forest floor (i. e., rain-based plus small litter inputs), a surprisingly high contribution given the sandy P-poor soils. At the start of the wet season leaching of K from the canopy was particularly high. Calcium in the rain was also highest at this time, most likely due to washing off of dry-deposited Harmattan dusts. It is proposed that throughfall has an important `priming' function in the rapid decomposition of litter and mineralization of P at the start of the wet season. The contribution of P inputted from the atmosphere appears to be significant when compared to the rates of P mineralization from leaf litter.

AB  - Decomposition of cellulose was studied in Scots pine stands lying on a sulphur and nitrogen concentration gradient from 1.3 to 2.8 g S kg-1 and from 7.9 to 16.3 g N kg-1 in mor humus. A number of biological variables had been found to decrease along the pollution gradient, e.g. soil respiration rate, microbial biomass, pine root mycorrhiza, diversity and sporophore production of mycorrhizal fungi, and the numbers of certain soil animals. Our aims were to evaluate two methods, cellulose decomposition determined in the field and cellulase activity determined in the laboratory, and to compare cellulase activity with other soil characteristics measured at the same sites. The activity of cellulase enzymes measured in the laboratory correlated well with basal respiration and correlated better with the S and N pollution gradient than the basal respiration rate. When cellulase activity was weighted toward the SIR values (substrate induced respiration), which reflect the amount of microbial biomass, it correlated best with the heavy metal concentrations in the soil especially in the most polluted stands. The decomposition of cellulose cardboard strips exposed in the field for 1 yr did not correlate with cellulase activity measured in the laboratory or with any pollution measurements, and this method seems to be too insensitive for measuring changes in microbial activities or the total decomposition process. {\textcopyright} 1994.

AB  - Deforestation causes the formation of forest fragments and edges, changing the biotic and abiotic conditions of a forest ecosystem. The edge effects in a forest can be assessed by soil indicators. The objective of this study was to evaluate the litter stock and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community as edge effect indicators in a fragment of a seasonal forest in Vitoria da Conquista, Bahia state. Sampling was carried out at the end of each season. Four sampling ranges were established in the edge-interior direction (edge: 0-10 m, range 1: 40-50 m, range 2: 80-90 m, and interior: 400 m). The accumulated litter was collected four times using a wooden template (area 0.25 m(2)). The soil samples (layer 0-5 cm) for extracting the spores of mycorrhizal fungi were collected from the same litter collection areas. The edge effect in areas of a seasonal forest can change the litter stock, showing a mass reduction closer to the edge. The community of mycorrhizal fungi shows the occurrence of unique species in the gradient of edge-interior fragment.

AB  - Mycorrhizas are the chief organ for plant mineral nutrient acquisition. In temperate, mixed forests, ash roots (Fraxinus excelsior) are colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) and beech roots (Fagus sylvatica) by ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcM). Knowledge on the functions of different mycorrhizal species that coexist in the same environment is scarce. The concentrations of nutrient elements in plant and fungal cells can inform on nutrient accessibility and interspecific differences of mycorrhizal life forms. Here, we hypothesized that mycorrhizal fungal species exhibit interspecific differences in mineral nutrient concentrations and that the differences correlate with the mineral nutrient concentrations of their associated root cells. Abundant mycorrhizal fungal species of mature beech and ash trees in a long-term undisturbed forest ecosystem were the EcM Lactarius subdulcis, Clavulina cristata and Cenococcum geophilum and the AM Glomus sp. Mineral nutrient subcellular localization and quantities of the mycorrhizas were analysed after non-aqueous sample preparation by electron dispersive X-ray transmission electron microscopy. Cenococcum geophilum contained the highest sulphur, Clavulina cristata the highest calcium levels, and Glomus, in which cations and P were generally high, exhibited the highest potassium levels. Lactarius subdulcisassociated root cells contained the highest phosphorus levels. The root cell concentrations of K, Mg and P were unrelated to those of the associated fungal structures, whereas S and Ca showed significant correlations between fungal and plant concentrations of those elements. Our results support profound interspecific differences for mineral nutrient acquisition among mycorrhizas formed by different fungal taxa. The lack of correlation between some plant and fungal nutrient element concentrations may reflect different retention of mineral nutrients in the fungal part of the symbiosis. High mineral concentrations, especially of potassium, in Glomus sp. suggest that the well-known influence of tree species on chemical soil properties may be related to their mycorrhizal associates. {\textcopyright} 2014 Seven, Polle.

AB  - Headwater riparian wetlands are relatively small in size but functionally significant as expected hot spots of microbial activity in the landscape. Despite their roles as biogeochemical drivers, little is known about how microbial communities in headwater riparian wetlands are affected by surrounding land-uses and land-covers (LULCs). The primary objective of this study was to determine if and how wetland soil microbial abundance and community composition varied as a function of landscape metrics as mediated through on-site edaphic properties. Forty-two soil samples, collected from eight headwater riparian wetlands in the Ridge and Valley Region of central Pennsylvania, were used for phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling of soil microbial communities. These samples were used to create microbial habitat models describing plot-level relationships between edaphic properties and microbial measures (i.e., microbial biomarker abundances, ratios and composition). Soil organic matter (SOM) content was a strong predictor of microbial biomarker abundances and fungi/bacteria ratios, while soil pH was a strong predictor of microbial composition (i.e., relative abundance of individual fatty acids) and potential microbial stress indices (i.e., cy19:0418:1 omega 7c and cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c ratios). Soil texture, soil moisture, and litter total nitrogen had smaller, but significant effects in these empirical microbial habitat models. Microbial habitat models were subsequently used to estimate microbial measures for a larger regional headwater riparian wetland dataset (n = 87), where edaphic property information was compiled. Site-average microbial measures were correlated with wetland elevation, and with landscape composition metrics in a landscape assessment area (i.e., 125,664 m(2)). Wetland elevation explained high among-site variability in microbial abundance measures, as mediated through SOM content, in headwater riparian wetlands in forested landscapes. However, wetland elevation was confounded by landscape composition, for headwater riparian wetland in mixed forested-agricultural landscapes. Hydrology, geomorphology, and changes in vegetation could be used to explain SOM variation across wetland elevation and variability in surrounding landscape composition. Microbial composition measures, including the cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c ratio and principal component (PC) axes derived from 23 individual PLFA biomarkers were negatively related to the Landscape Development Intensity (LDI) index, and the percent area of row crops, pastures and grasslands, and positively related to the percent area of forest. The cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c ratio was positively related to the LDI index, and the percent area of pasture and grasslands, and negatively related to the percent area of forest and wetland elevation. Differences along PC axes were most clearly related to the relative abundances of fungal communities; headwater riparian wetland in forested landscapes had significantly higher relative abundances of saprophytic fungi biomarkers, while headwater riparian wetland in mixed landscapes had significantly higher relative abundances of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi biomarker. This study highlights the utility of simple landscape metrics, which describe wetland position and landscape composition, for predicting differences in edaphic variability and associated microbial community composition and biomass among headwater riparian wetlands at a regional scale.

AB  - We investigated the natural abundance of N-15 in sun leaves and other components of tropical rain forests on altitudinal sequences of eight sites that form a gradient of soil N availability with varying ectomycorrhizal abundances on Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo. We investigated how soil N availability and ectomycorrhizal abundance related to the N-15 abundance of ecosystem components. delta N-15 values (N-15 abundance relative to N-14) increased consistently in the following order at each site: sun leaves, leaf litter, fine roots and from shallower organic to deeper mineral soil horizons. Enrichment (3-6 parts per thousand delta N-15) of N-15 occurred at the litter-topsoil interface at all sites, and the magnitude of the enrichment correlated negatively with N-15 depletion in the foliage, irrespective of ectomycorrhizal abundance. Foliar delta N-15 values significantly positively correlated with their N concentrations. Foliar (and litter and root) delta N-15 values correlated positively with NO3 availability, and negatively with NH4 availability. The two positive correlations of foliar delta N-15 with foliar N and NO3 availability were inconsistent with the assumption that stronger nitrification (hence a greater nitrate availability) produced a more N-15-depleted active inorganic N pool. The isotopic fractionation during the passage of N through ectomycorrhizas to plants might explain the positive correlation of foliar delta N-15 and N concentration; however, this mechanism could not fully explain the correlation in our case because strong foliar N-15 depletions occurred at the sites that lacked ectomycorrhizas. Alternatively, the positive correlation across sites reflected the tightness of N cycling. Strong nitrification and associated isotopic fractionation might have occurred at N-richer sites and the subsequent removal of NO3 from the system could decrease isotopically `lighter' N at these sites.

AB  - Fungi are recognized as efficient decomposers of biopolymers contained in soil or litter, but not all saprotrophic taxa are equally efficient in accessing various C sources. While many fungi may be considered generalists that are able to utilize complex biomass of plant, bacterial, and fungal origin, it is less clear which of the individual biopolymers that compose these substrates they utilize. Here we analysed fungal communities in forest topsoil enriched in bags with polymers composing plant (cellulose, xylan, glucomannan, pectin, lignin) and fungal (chitin, $\beta$-1,3-glucan, and $\beta$-1,3-1,6-glucan) biomass along with fungal abundance and the activity of enzymes. There was a high degree of specialization among saprotrophs, each biopolymer being preferred by distinct taxa. White-rot fungi and general saprotrophs were most common on cellulose and xylan, while pectin and lignin-associated communities were dominated by moulds, and animal pathogens were found almost exclusively on chitin. Although several enzymes were produced on all biopolymers, the composition of enzyme pools was significantly different among substrates and different from litter. Activity of endocellulase, $\beta$-galactosidase, $\beta$-mannosidase, and $\beta$-glucosidase significantly correlated with the fungal to bacterial biomass ratio indicating the important role of fungi in their production. The results indicate the high level of specialization among litter-inhabiting fungi and differences in the substrate preference across nutritional guilds of saprotrophic fungi. While most of the litter-inhabiting fungi utilize plant biopolymers, fungal biopolymers are also frequently targeted. {\textcopyright} 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Orchids require mycorrhizal fungi for germination of seed and growth of seedlings. The colonisation of bauxite-mine rehabilitation areas by orchids is therefore dependent on the availability of both seed and mycorrhizal fungi. Orchid mycorrhizal fungi baiting trials were carried out in rehabilitation areas that were 1, 10 and 26 years old (established in 2001, 1992 and 1976) and adjacent unmined jarrah forest areas at Jarrahdale, Western Australia. Fungal baits consisted of buried six-chambered nylon-mesh packets containing seed of six jarrah forest orchid taxa, Caladenia flava subsp. flava R.Br., Disa bracteata Sw., Microtis media subsp. media R.Br., Pterostylis recurva Benth., Pyrorchis nigricans (R.Br.) D.L.Jones & M.A.Clem. and Thelymitra crinita Lindl. Detection of orchid mycorrhizal fungi was infrequent, especially at the youngest rehabilitation sites where only mycorrhizal fungi associated with P. recurva were detected. Mycorrhizal fungi of the other orchid taxa were widespread but sparsely distributed in older rehabilitation and forest areas. Detection of mycorrhizal fungi varied between taxa and baiting sites for the two survey years (2002 and 2004). Caladenia flava subsp. flava and T. crinita mycorrhizal fungi were the most frequently detected. The presence of C. flava mycorrhizal fungi was correlated with leafy litter cover and maximum depth, and soil moisture at the vegetation type scale (50 × 5 m belt transects), as well as tree and litter cover at the microhabitat scale (1-m2 quadrats). The presence of T. crinita mycorrhizal fungi was positively correlated with soil moisture in rehabilitation areas and low shrub cover in forest. The frequency of detection of orchid mycorrhizal fungi both at rehabilitated sites (15-25% of baits) and in unmined forest (15-50% of baits) tended to increase with rehabilitation age as vegetation recovered. The failure of some orchid taxa to reinvade rehabilitation areas is unlikely to be entirely due to absence of the appropriate mycorrhizal fungi. However, since the infrequent detection of fungi suggests that they occur in isolated patches of soil, the majority of dispersed orchid seeds are likely to perish, especially in recently disturbed habitats. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2007.

AB  - Winter air temperatures are rising faster than summer air temperatures in high-latitude forests, increasing the frequency of soil freeze/thaw events in winter. To determine how climate warming and soil freeze/thaw cycles affect soil microbial communities and the ecosystem processes they drive, we leveraged the Climate Change across Seasons Experiment (CCASE) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the northeastern United States, where replicate field plots receive one of three climate treatments: warming (+5°C above ambient in the growing season), warming in the growing season + winter freeze/thaw cycles (+5°C above ambient +4 freeze/thaw cycles during winter), and no treatment. Soil samples were taken from plots at six time points throughout the growing season and subjected to amplicon (rDNA) and metagenome sequencing. We found that soil fungal and bacterial community composition were affected by changes in soil temperature, where the taxonomic composition of microbial communities shifted more with the combination of growing-season warming and increased frequency of soil freeze/thaw cycles in winter than with warming alone. Warming increased the relative abundance of brown rot fungi and plant pathogens but decreased that of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, all of which recovered under combined growing-season warming and soil freeze/thaw cycles in winter. The abundance of animal parasites increased significantly under combined warming and freeze/thaw cycles. We also found that warming and soil freeze/thaw cycles suppressed bacterial taxa with the genetic potential for carbon (i.e., cellulose) decomposition and soil nitrogen cycling, such as N fixation and the final steps of denitrification. These new soil communities had higher genetic capacity for stress tolerance and lower genetic capacity to grow or reproduce, relative to the communities exposed to warming in the growing season alone. Our observations suggest that initial suppression of biogeochemical cycling with year-round climate change may be linked to the emergence of taxa that trade-off growth for stress tolerance traits. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020 Garcia, Templer, Sorensen, Sanders-DeMott, Groffman and Bhatnagar.

AB  - Mesophellia and Castorium are common hypogeous macrofungi in the karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor F. Muell.) and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Sm.) forests of south‐western Australia. Sporocarps of Mesophellia and Castorium develop 5‐20 cm below the soil surface in close association with eucalypt roots. During differentiation of the sporocarps, eucalypt roots become trapped within the peridium where they branch profusely and form a dense ectomycorrhizal layer. Mature sporocarps of M. trabalis nom. ined. contain approximately S m of roots of 45 cm2 surface area. Anatomical studies have shown that these roots have Hartig nets penetrating to the hypodermis and are similar to the superficial eucalypt ectomycorrhizas formed in soil and litter. The association of Mesophellia and Castorium sporocarps with tree roots suggests that these are important mycorrhizal fungi in forests of southern Australia.

AB  - Soil food webs are compartmentalized and comprise major energy channels, such as the plant litter, fungal and bacterial channel. However, the relative contribution of basal resources to these channels for nutrition of higher trophic levels is largely unknown. 2.The study took advantage of the Swiss Canopy Crane Project, where a mature temperate forest was labelled with 13C-depleted CO 2. By exchanging leaf litter between the 13CO 2-enriched area and an unlabelled control area, we were able to separate carbon fluxes originating from leaf litter and roots, respectively. 3.Fatty acid (FA) composition and $\delta$ 13C signatures of individual FAs of basal resources and soil animals, including decomposers and predators, were analysed. Marker FAs allowed differentiation of the contribution of plant litter, fungi and bacteria to the nutrition of higher trophic levels. 4.Our findings suggest that root-derived carbon is of major importance for the soil animal food web and that it enters the soil animal food web mainly via feeding on ectomycorrhizal fungi. 5.In contrast to previous studies that emphasized the dominance of the fungal energy channel, significant amounts of bacterial FAs in each of the predator species studied indicate that the bacterial energy channel is considerably more important for the nutrition of higher trophic levels than previously assumed. The flux of energy along the two channels presumably contributes to food web stability. 6.Compound-specific 13(CO 2) FA analysis of basal resources and soil animals allowed the separation of energy fluxes originating from ectomycorrhizal vs. saprotrophic fungi, from bacteria feeding on leaf litter vs. bacteria feeding on root exudates, and from leaf litter itself, providing information on the partitioning of these different energy channels in unprecedented detail. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

AB  - We studied variation in forest floor thickness in four plantations of red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) which were similar in age, soil type and associated vegetation. The plantations were located (west to east) in the Clear Creek, Moshannon, Sproul and Tiadaghton State Forests of Pennsylvania, USA. A gradient in forest floor thickness exists across these plantations; the forest floor is thickest in the west and it becomes progressively thinner toward the east. Decomposition of imported litter increased from west to east, suggesting that the variation in forest floor thickness is related to variation in the rate of decomposition. Decomposition rates were related to saprotroph abundance. Variation in forest floor N and phenolic concentrations, in overall mycorrhiza density and in the relative proportions of three common mycorrhiza morphotypes could not explain the variation in decomposition rate. The P concentrations and pH of the forest floor were significantly lower at Clear Creek and Moshannon, where decomposition rates were lowest, compared to Sproul and Tiadaghton, where decomposition rates were most rapid. This suggests that P concentration and pH may have exerted some control on decomposition.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi largely determine the element offer at the fungusroot interface, although they do not take over the plant nutrient uptake system. In complex forest soils, trees undoubtedly benefit from the well-adapted nutrient acquisition strategies evolved in the huge diversity of ECM fungi that occupy the numerous niches in the different soil types. As with all organisms, mycorrhizal fungi feature genes encoding proteins involved in trace element acquisition, storage and remobilization to assure cellular homeostasis regardless of natural external fluctuations. A constant cellular concentration of essential trace elements is required to secure growth and reproduction and to overcome toxicity. Transcriptome analysis is the most prominently used approach to identify genes and gene products involved in trace element homeostasis. Imbalances in the cellular homeostasis of trace elements, even brief ones, produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can be generated directly by redox-active elements or indirectly by redox-inactive elements. {\textcopyright} 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The symbiosis (ectomycorrhiza, ECM) between roots of trees and shrubs of boreal and temperate forest ecosystems and soil fungi is essential for water and nutrient acquisition of the plants. The functionality of ECM is largely dependent on the ability of the host plant to supply photoassimilates to the fungus via the symbiotic interface. Based on sterile in vitro and non-sterile pot experiments, we review data which gives evidence that hexoses are supplied to the fungus by the host plant (mainly glucose and fructose), and that these sugars, at least in part, control development and function of ECM by interfering with fungal gene expression. We further show that any factor which reduces hexose allocation to the host-fungus interface will adversely affect ECM development. As an example, we address the impact of increased supply of nitrogen on the biochemistry of plant-fungus interaction and discuss potential consequences on host performance.

AB  - Humans have dramatically increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition globally. At the coarsest resolution, N deposition is correlated with shifts from ectomycorrhizal (EcM) to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree dominance. At finer resolution, ectomycorrhizal fungal (EcMF) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities respond strongly to long-term N deposition with the disappearance of key taxa. Conifer-associated EcMF are more sensitive than other EcMF, with current estimates of critical loads at 5–6 kg ha−1 yr−1 for the former and 10–20 kg ha−1 yr−1 for the latter. Where loads are exceeded, strong plant-soil and microbe-soil feedbacks may slow recovery rates after abatement of N deposition. Critical loads for AMF and tropical EcMF require additional study. In general, the responses of EcMF to N deposition are better understood than those of AMF because of methodological tractability. Functional consequences of EcMF community change are linked to decreases by fungi with medium-distance exploration strategies, hydrophobic walls, proteolytic capacity, and perhaps peroxidases for acquiring N from soil organic matter. These functional losses may contribute to declines in forest floor decomposition under N deposition. For AMF, limited capacity to directly access complexed organic N may reduce functional consequences, but research is needed to test this hypothesis. Mycorrhizal biomass often declines with N deposition, but the relative contributions of alternate mechanisms for this decline (lower C supply, higher C cost, physiological stress by N) have not been quantified. Furthermore, fungal biomass and functional responses to N inputs probably depend on ecosystem P status, yet how N deposition-induced P limitation interacts with belowground C flux and mycorrhizal community structure and function is still unclear. Current ‘omic analyses indicate potential functional differences among fungal lineages and should be integrated with studies of physiology, host nutrition, growth and health, fungal and plant community structure, and ecosystem processes. Forest mycorrhizal fungal community composition responds strongly to N deposition across broad ranges of spatial, temporal and phylogenetic scales, with functional consequences—including altered tree nutrition and C, N, and P cycling—that are substantial but only partially understood. {\textcopyright} 2018

AB  - In the last decades a drastic increase in air temperature but a stable precipitation regime in Mongolia has led to gradual drying conditions. Thus, we evaluated the effect of spatial and climatic characteristics on the soil–plant nitrogen dynamics in three representative larch stands (Larix sibirica) with different geographical and climatic conditions using stable nitrogen isotopes. The results showed significant differences in the soil inorganic N content among sites and consequently a different isotopic composition in the plant–soil system. Litter, bark and wood had the lowest $\delta$15N values for all sites, slightly higher $\delta$15N values for needles, while the highest $\delta$15N values were observed for roots and soil. These differences could be the result of the larch stands age themselves, but were in agreement with the spatial and climatic characteristics of the sites. Based on the $\delta$15N value a higher reliance on ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF) was observed in the warmest and driest site, while lower dependency was shown in the cooler northern site with higher soil inorganic N content. In both sites, the rate of air temperature increase has been similar in the last decades; however, their soil–plant N dynamics showed different characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2018, {\textcopyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As the number of drought occurrences has been predicted to increase with increasing temperatures, it is believed that boreal forests will become particularly vulnerable to decreased growth and increased tree mortality caused by the hydraulic failure, carbon starvation and vulnerability to pests following these. Although drought-affected trees are known to have stunted growth, as well as increased allocation of carbon to roots, still not enough is known about the ways in which trees can acclimate to drought. We studied how drought stress affects belowground and aboveground carbon dynamics, as well as nitrogen uptake, in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings exposed to prolonged drought. Overall 40 Scots pine seedlings were divided into control and drought treatments over two growing seasons. Seedlings were pulse-labelled with 13CO2 and litter bags containing 15N-labelled root biomass, and these were used to follow nutrient uptake of trees. We determined photosynthesis, biomass distribution, root and rhizosphere respiration, water potential, leaf osmolalities and carbon and nitrogen assimilation patterns in both treatments. The photosynthetic rate of the drought-induced seedlings did not decrease compared to the control group, the maximum leaf specific photosynthetic rate being 0.058 and 0.045 $\mu$ mol g-1 s-1 for the drought and control treatments, respectively. The effects of drought were, however, observed as lower water potentials, increased osmolalities as well as decreased growth and greater fine root-to-shoot ratio in the drought-treated seedlings. We also observed improved uptake of labelled nitrogen from soil to needles in the drought-treated seedlings. The results indicate acclimation of seedlings to long-term drought by aiming to retain sufficient water uptake with adequate allocation to roots and root-associated mycorrhizal fungi. The plants seem to control water potential with osmolysis, for which sufficient photosynthetic capability is needed. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Author.

AB  - Many trees form ectomycorrhizal symbiosis with fungi. During symbiosis, the tree roots supply sugar to the fungi in exchange for nitrogen, and this process is critical for the nitrogen and carbon cycles in forest ecosystems. However, the extents to which ectomycorrhizal fungi can liberate nitrogen and modify the soil organic matter and the mechanisms by which they do so remain unclear since they have lost many enzymes for litter decomposition that were present in their free-living, saprotrophic ancestors. Using time-series spectroscopy and transcriptomics, we examined the ability of two ectomycorrhizal fungi from two independently evolved ectomycorrhizal lineages to mobilize soil organic nitrogen. Both species oxidized the organic matter and accessed the organic nitrogen. The expression of those events was controlled by the availability of glucose and inorganic nitrogen. Despite those similarities, the decomposition mechanisms, including the type of genes involved as well as the patterns of their expression, differed markedly between the two species. Our results suggest that in agreement with their diverse evolutionary origins, ectomycorrhizal fungi use different decomposition mechanisms to access organic nitrogen entrapped in soil organic matter. The timing and magnitude of the expression of the decomposition activity can be controlled by the below-ground nitrogen quality and the above-ground carbon supply. {\textcopyright} 2018, International Society for Microbial Ecology.

AB  - Microbial respiration in dead wood contributes substantially to the long-lived forest carbon (C) pool and has a significant role in the forest nitrogen (N) cycle. Wood N content has been found to increase during the decay process; however, temporal dynamics and the sources of this external N remain unclear. To examine N dynamics at various stages of decomposition, we combined high variety of analytical methods on Norway spruce logs, including wood $\delta$15N, N%, 14C-dating, fungal composition and N2 fixation rate. For N2 fixation rate, we also determined its dependency on ambient temperature and decay class, when estimating annual N2 fixation rates for our study site. N2 fixation was observed to have a major role in increasing wood N content during decay. For the most decayed wood, it accounted for 60% of the total N accumulation. Compared to other reports, where the annual temperature was similar to our site, the calculated annual fixation rate of 85 g N ha−1 year−1 is a low estimate. However, previous studies have not taken appropriately into account the dependency of N2 fixation rate on ambient temperature and decay class. Our $\delta$15N model describing the sources of external N, statistical analysis and the fungal DNA composition of decayed wood suggest that other sources of external N accumulating in wood were soil-foraging wood-decay fungi and mycorrhizal fungi. Our study improves knowledge of the temporal dynamics of N accumulation in wood with advancing wood decay, the potential sources of external N and their relative significance. All of these factors are important for nitrogen as well as carbon models dealing with ecosystem responses to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

AB  - We examined the seasonal dynamics of respiration activity and fluorescence of Siberian spruce and Scots pine in blueberry-sphagnum spruce forest and mixed forest in the middle taiga in the Republic of Komi. Physiological activity of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) roots measured by fluorescein diacetate dyeing highly correlated with root respiration. EcM roots of spruce and pine had high fluorescent activity. Fluorescence of fungal component decreased following forest litter moisture content, with increasing of inactive hyphal sheaths. We found relation between thin roots of the trees and moisture content and temperature of forest litter. EcM activity was highest in July – August in terms of seasonal dynamics, and during mornings in daily dynamics. Respiration of thin physiologically active roots of spruce in the litter of blueberry-sphagnum spruce forest varied in the range of 600–1025 kg C ha–1 per season, which constituted 23–29% of the total soil CO2 emission. Respiration of thin pine roots in mixed forest varied from 204 to 350 kg C ha–1 per season. {\textcopyright} 2017, Izdatel'stvo Nauka. All rights reserved.

AB  - Establishment of native grasses is a primary objective of restoration in Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum (P. \& C. Lawson) forests in the southwestern United States. Interactions among native grasses and soil microorganisms generate feedbacks that influence the achievement of this objective. We examined soil chemical properties and communities of plants and soil microorganisms in clear-cuts and P. ponderosa stands thinned and maintained at low and medium tree densities for over 40 years along with high density (unthinned) stands. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in soils were analyzed to examine arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and microbial communities in the three thinning treatments and the unthinned stands with and without a recent broadcast burn. Additionally, two native bunchgrasses, Festuca arizonica and Muhlenbergia wrightii were grown in containers filled with intact soil cores collected from each field plot to more thoroughly compare the abundance of AM fungi and microbial communities across different stand densities and burn treatments. Tree thinning decreased litter cover and increased the abundance and diversity and altered community composition of both herbaceous vegetation and AM fungi. In the mineral soil layer, the pH, total carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and PLFA profiles did not differ significantly among the four stand density or burn treatments. Mycorrhizal colonization of the container grown grasses did not significantly differ with tree density or burn treatments; however, F. arizonica roots had a strong trend for decreased colonization when grown in soil from high density (unthinned) tree cover. Soil from the containers with F. arizonica had a greater abundance of AM fungal spores. Furthermore, bacterial community composition varied with grass species. Concentration of biomarkers for bacteria were higher in soil that supported F. arizonica compared to soil in which M. wrightii was grown. Our results indicate that the creation of clear-cut openings in forests may increase the abundance and richness of AM fungal propagules and soil bacterial communities were surprisingly resilient to tree thinning and low-intensity fire treatments. These results suggest managing forests to create clear-cut openings generate conditions that favor understory native grasses and AM fungi that are linked to soil bacterial communities.

AB  - IT is well known that beech litter is less susceptible to decomposition than is the litter of many other species including maple. One reason for this may be the presence or absence of certain factors inhibiting or stimulating microbial growth. For example, factors inhibitory to various fungi have been shown to occur in leaf exudates of certain plants1 and in many plant extracts2,3,4, whereas factors stimulating certain mycorrhizal and saprophytic Hymenomycetes have also been observed3. Antibacterial factors have been demonstrated in extracts of oak and maple leaves5, spruce needles6, and in other species7. Autoclaving of the extract has been shown to increase the inhibition of fungi3 and bacteria5 under the experimental conditions used. {\textcopyright} 1959 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - The relative diversity and abundance of different functional groups of macrofungi were investigated in the northern jarrah forest, a mediterranean climate sclerophyllous forest dominated by eucalyptus trees in Western Australia. We sampled paired sites that were either severely affected by dieback, a disease caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi which causes selective plant mortality, or unaffected by this type of forest decline. Macrofungi were sampled 3 times during the growing season along six 100 m x 2 m transects in these sites. Dieback-unaffected sites were found to have significantly different macrofungal floras than unaffected sites. Macrofungal abundance and diversity were approximately 1.5 times and 1.8 times greater respectively in dieback-unaffected sites than in severely affected sites. Dieback-affected sites had a similar diversity of saprotrophic and ectomycorthizal fungi, whereas more fungal taxa on dieback-unaffected sites were mycorrhizal (>60\%). Dung fungi were the most common saprophytes, especially in dieback-affected sites, but abundance data greatly overestimated the importance of these relatively small fungi. We concluded that vegetation changes linked to dieback had a negative effect on fungal community structure and biodiversity in the northern jarrah forest, in a similar manner to other forms of severe disturbance. Conversely, high tree mortality increased the abundance of wood decay fungi, at least in the short term. We expect that reductions in macrofungal species richness were indirectly linked to impacts on mycorrhizal host plants and saprotrophic substrates. Our data show that changes in vegetation composition had the greatest effect on ectomycorrhizal fungi, presumably due to their obligate symbiotic associations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous in tropical forests. AMF play a role in the forest carbon cycle because they can increase nutrient acquisition and biomass of host plants, but also incur a carbon cost to the plant. Through their interactions with their host plants they have the potential to affect how plants respond to environmental perturbation such as global warming. Our objective was to experimentally determine how plant respiration rates and responses to warmer environment are affected by AMF colonization in seedlings of five tropical tree species at the whole plant level. We evaluated the interaction between AMF colonization and temperature on plant respiration against four possible outcomes; acclimation does or does not occur regardless of AMF, or AMF can increase or decrease respiratory acclimation. Seedlings were inoculated with AMF spores or sterilized inoculum and grown at ambient or elevated nighttime temperature. We measured whole plant and belowground respiration rates, as well as plant growth and biomass allocation. There was an overall increase in whole plant, root, and shoot respiration rate with AMF colonization, whereas temperature acclimation varied among species, showing support for three of the four possible responses. The influence of AMF colonization on growth and allocation also varied among plant species. This study shows that the effect of AMF colonization on acclimation differs among plant species. Given the cosmopolitan nature of AMF and the importance of plant acclimation for predicting climate feedbacks a better understanding of the patterns and mechanisms of acclimation is essential for improving predictions of how climate warming may influence vegetation feedbacks. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The atmospheric concentration of CO2 is predicted to reach double current levels by 2075. Detritus from aboveground and belowground plant parts constitutes the primary source of C for soil organic matter (SOM), and accumulation of SOM in forests may provide a significant mechanism to mitigate increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In a poplar (three species) plantation exposed to ambient (380 ppm) and elevated (580 ppm) atmospheric CO2 concentrations using a Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) system, the relative importance of leaf litter decomposition, fine root and fungal turnover for C incorporation into SOM was investigated. A technique using cores of soil in which a C4 crop has been grown ($\delta$13C -18.1‰) inserted into the plantation and detritus from C3 trees ($\delta$13C -27 to -30‰) was used to distinguish between old (native soil) and new (tree derived) soil C. In-growth cores using a fine mesh (39 $\mu$m) to prevent in-growth of roots, but allow in-growth of fungal hyphae were used to assess contribution of fine roots and the mycorrhizal external mycelium to soil C during a period of three growing seasons (1999-2001). Across all species and treatments, the mycorrhizal external mycelium was the dominant pathway (62%) through which carbon entered the SOM pool, exceeding the input via leaf litter and fine root turnover. The input via the mycorrhizal external mycelium was not influenced by elevated CO2, but elevated atmospheric CO2 enhanced soil C inputs via fine root turnover. The turnover of the mycorrhizal external mycelium may be a fundamental mechanism for the transfer of root-derived C to SOM. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.

AB  - The decomposition and the fate of N-15-labelled beech litter was monitored in a beech forest (Vosges mountains, France) over 3 years. Circular plots around beech trees were isolated from neighbouring tree roots by soil trenching. After removal of the litter layer, N-15-labelled litter was distributed on the soil. Samples {[}labelled litter, soil (0-15 cm depths], fine roots, mycorrhizal root tips, leaves) were collected during the subsequent vegetation periods and analysed for total N and N-15 concentration. Mass loss of the N-15-labelled litter was estimated using mass loss data from a litterbag experiment set up at the field site. An initial and rapid release of soluble N from the decomposing litter was balanced by the incorporation of exogenous N into the litter. Fungal N accounted fur approximately 35\% of the N incorporation. Over 2 years, litter N was continuously released and rates of N and mass loss were equivalent, while litter N was preferentially lost during the 3rd year. Released N-15 accumulated essentially at the soil surface. N-15 from the decomposing litter was rapidly (i.e. in 6 months) detected in roots and beech leaves and its level increased regularly and linearly over the course of the labelling experiment. After 3 years, about 2\% of the original litter N had accumulated in the trees. 15N budgets indicated that soluble N was the main source for soil microbial biomass. Nitrogen accumulated in storage compounds was the main source of leaf N, while soil organic N was the main source of mycorrhizal N. Use of N-15-labelled beech litter as decomposing substrate allowed assessment of the fate of litter N in the soil and tree N pools in a beech forest on different time scales.

AB  - (1) While it is well-known that trees release carbon (C) to soils as root exudates, the factors that control the magnitude and biogeochemical impacts of this flux are poorly understood. (2) We quantified root exudation and microbially-mediated nutrient fluxes in the rhizosphere for four similar to 80 year-old tree species in a deciduous hardwood forest, Indiana, USA. We hypothesized that trees that exuded the most carbon (C) would induce the strongest rhizosphere effects (i.e., the relative difference in nutrient fluxes between rhizosphere and bulk soil). Further, we hypothesized that tree species that associate with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi would exude more C than tree species that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, resulting in a greater enhancement of nutrient cycling in ECM rhizospheres. (3) Mass-specific exudation rates and rhizosphere effects on C, N and P cycling were nearly two-fold greater for the two ECM tree species compared to the two AM tree species (P < 0.05). Moreover, across all species, exudation rates were positively correlated with multiple indices of nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition in the rhizosphere (P < 0.05). Annually, we estimate that root exudation represents 2.5\% of NPP in this forest, and that the exudate-induced changes in microbial N cycling may contribute similar to 18\% of total net N mineralization. (4) Collectively, our results indicate that the effects of roots on nutrient cycling are consequential, particularly in forests where the C cost of mining nutrients from decomposing soil organic matter may be greatest (e.g., ECM-dominated stands). Further, our results suggest that small C fluxes from exudation may have disproportionate impacts on ecosystem N cycling in nutrient-limited forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of disturbance by recreational activities (trampling) on changes in soil organic matter (SOM) and on mycorrhizal roots of seedlings and mature trees were studied in four stands of a beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest near Basel, Switzerland. At each site, comparable disturbed and undisturbed plots were selected. Disturbance reduced ground cover vegetation and leaf litter. Beech seedlings had lower biomass after disturbance. Ergosterol concentration in seedling roots, an indicator of mycorrhizal fungi, was lower in two of the four disturbed plots compared to undisturbed plots; these two disturbed sites had especially low litter levels. Based on ergosterol measurements, mycorrhizas of mature trees did not appear to be negatively affected by trampling. Total fine roots and SOM were higher in the disturbed than in the undisturbed plots at three sites. At the fourth site, fine roots and SOM in the disturbed areas were lower than in the undisturbed areas most probably due to nutrient input following picnic activities. Principal component analysis revealed a close correlation between SOM and fine roots of mature trees as well as litter and seedling biomass. Trampling due to recreational activities caused considerable damage to the vegetation layer and in particular to the beech seedlings and their mycorrhizal fine roots, whereas, roots of mature trees were apparently resilient to trampling.

AB  - We investigated the ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal community of naturally regenerating Pinus densiflora seedlings on exposed decomposed granite (DG) slopes along woodland paths in the Republic of Korea. We sampled three- to five-year-old seedlings from slopes where DG was exposed (habitat S) and from the surrounding forest edge or gaps (habitat F). We classified EcMs into morphological groups and counted the number of root tips. The fungal taxa were determined by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer region of their nuclear rDNA. We observed a total of 27 EcM fungal taxa. Atheliaceae and Rhizopogon were the dominant taxa on exposed DG slopes. The fungal species compositions were similar between habitats (0.59 as calculated by the Morishita-Horn index). Fourteen fungal taxa were common to both habitats, and these accounted for more than 90% of the relative abundance in each habitat. There were no significant differences in relative abundance and colonization frequency of each EcM fungal taxon between the habitats, except for Russula sp. 2, which was significantly more frequent in habitat F than in habitat S. Our results indicated that P. densiflora seedlings on exposed DG slopes associated with EcM fungi that were common in forests and not specific to the exposed DG slopes. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Japanese Forest Society and Springer.

AB  - The convergent evolution of polyphenol-rich plant communities has occurred on highly acidic and infertile soils throughout the world. The pygmy forest in coastal northern California is an example of an ecosystem on an extremely infertile soil that has exceptionally high concentrations of polyphenols. Many 'negative feedbacks' have been identified whereby plants degrade fertile soils through production of polyphenol-rich litter, sequestering soil nutrients into unavailable form and creating unfavorable conditions for seed germination, root growth, and nutrient uptake. But in the context of plant-litter-soil interactions in ecosystems adapted to soils that are inherently acidic and infertile (such as the pygmy forest), there are also many 'positive feedbacks' that result from polyphenol production. By inhibiting decomposition, polyphenols regulate the formation of a mor-humus litter layer, conserving nutrients and creating a more favorable medium for root growth. Polyphenols shift the dominant pathway of nitrogen cycling from mineral to organic forms to minimize potential N losses from the ecosystem and maximize litter-N recovery by mycorrhizal symbionts. Polyphenol complexation of Al, Mn and Fe reduce potential A1 toxicity and P fixation in soil. Polyphenols regulate organic matter dynamics, leading to the accumulation of organic matter with cation exchange capacity to minimize leaching of nutrient cations. Humic substances derived from polyphenolic precursors coat rhizosphere soil surfaces, improving physical and chemical conditions for root growth and nutrient cycling. Although their long-accepted adaptive value for antiherbivore defense is now in doubt, polyphenol alteration of soil conditions and regulation of nutrient cycling illustrate how fitness can be influenced by the 'extended' phenotype in plant-litter-soil interactions.

AB  - Poor growth of conifer regeneration occurred on sites formerly occupied by old-growth cedar-hemlock (CH) forests in coastal British Columbia, 5-8 years after clearcutting and slashburning. Symptoms included chlorotic foliage and growth check of Sitka spruce, western hemlock, western red cedar and amabilis fir, coincident with the expansion of the ericaceous shrub, salal, on the cutovers. Fertilization trials identified N and P deficiencies as the cause of the growth check of conifers, and additions of 300 kg N ha(-1) and 100 kg P ha(-1) significantly improved tree growth rates. Equivalent growth responses were achieved with additions of sewage sludge and fish silage. Burning, cultivating, liming, higher planting densities or herbicide application, were less effective in promoting conifer growth. The nutrient deficiencies in conifers on CH cutovers were the result of two factors: low nutrient availability in soil and humus, and competition and interference from salal. Salal immobilized substantial amounts of N in biomass and an in vitro study suggested it was able to use organic forms of N through its mycorrhizal fungi. The mycorrhizae of salal also interfered with those of hemlock, which further reduced their ability to take up nutrients. High concentrations of phenolic acids were associated with salal which interfere with mineralization and uptake of N. The low availability of N and P in CH cutovers originated in forest floors of the old-growth forests prior to clearcutting. Nutrient availability was low in all layers of the forest floor in CH forests, and this appeared to result from three main factors. First, cedar litter contains less N and more decay-resistant material than other species, and produces forest floors with low rates of N mineralization. Second, the forest floors in CH forests are wetter and have less soil fauna than in HA forests, leading to incomplete decomposition and mineralization of N. Third, the salal understorey in CH forests interferes with mineralization of N through the production of tannins.

AB  - The origins and composition of soil organic matter (SOM) are still largely uncertain. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are recognized as indirect contributors through their influence on soil aggregation, plant physiology, and plant community composition. Here we present evidence that AMF can also make large, direct contributions to SOM. Glomalin, a recently discovered glycoprotein produced by AMF hyphae, was detected in tropical soils in concentrations of over 60 mg cm(-3). Along a chronosequence of soils spanning ages from 300 to 4.1 Mio years, a pattern of glomalin concentrations is consistent with the hypothesis that this protein accumulates in soil. Carbon dating of glomalin indicated turnover at time scales of several years to decades, much longer than the turnover of AMF hyphae (which is assumed to be on the order of days to weeks). This suggests that contributions of mycorrhizae to soil carbon storage based on hyphal biomass in soil and roots may be an underestimate. The amount of C and N in glomalin represented a sizeable amount (ca. 4-5\%) of total soil C and N in the oldest soils. Our results thus indicate that microbial (fungal) carbon that is not derived from above- or below-ground litter can make a significant contribution to soil carbon and nitrogen pools and can far exceed the contributions of soil microbial biomass (ranging from 0.08 to 0.2\% of total C for the oldest soils).

AB  - In forest ecosystems, ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi play a central role in the breakdown of soil organic matter (SOM). Competition between these two fungal guilds has long been hypothesized to lead to suppression of decomposition rates, a phenomenon known as the 'Gadgil effect'. In this review, we examine the documentation, generality, and potential mechanisms involved in the 'Gadgil effect'. We find that the influence of ectomycorrhizal fungi on litter and SOM decomposition is much more variable than previously recognized. To explain the inconsistency in size and direction of the 'Gadgil effect', we argue that a better understanding of underlying mechanisms is required. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of the primary mechanisms proposed to date and how using different experimental methods (trenching, girdling, microcosms), as well as considering different temporal and spatial scales, could influence the conclusions drawn about this phenomenon. Finally, we suggest that combining new research tools such as high-throughput sequencing with experiments utilizing natural environmental gradients will significantly deepen our understanding of the 'Gadgil effect' and its consequences on forest soil carbon and nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2016 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - Aims: In the Swedish sub-Arctic, mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) forests mediate rapid soil C cycling relative to adjacent tundra heaths, but little is known about the role of individual trees within forests. Here we investigate the spatial extent over which trees influence soil processes. Methods: We measured respiration, soil C stocks, root and mycorrhizal productivity and fungi:bacteria ratios at fine spatial scales along 3 m transects extending radially from mountain birch trees in a sub-Arctic ecotone forest. Root and mycorrhizal productivity was quantified using in-growth techniques and fungi:bacteria ratios were determined by qPCR. Results: Neither respiration, nor root and mycorrhizal production, varied along transects. Fungi:bacteria ratios, soil organic C stocks and standing litter declined with increasing distance from trees. Conclusions: As 3 m is half the average size of forest gaps, these findings suggest that forest soil environments are efficiently explored by roots and associated mycorrhizal networks of B. pubescens. Individual trees exert influence substantially away from their base, creating more uniform distributions of root, mycorrhizal and bacterial activity than expected. However, overall rates of soil C accumulation do vary with distance from trees, with potential implications for spatio-temporal soil organic matter dynamics and net ecosystem C sequestration. {\textcopyright} 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (TEM) have been observed in decaying coarse woody debris (CWD) and may play a role in the nitrogen economy of forests. This study evaluates the occurrence of Suillus tomentosus (Kauff.) Singer, Snell and Dick TEM within CWD in Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm. stands and relates their occurrence to CWD and soil characteristics as well as stand age. TEM were more abundant in the basal end of CWD incorporated in the forest floor than in the middle and top portions. Tubercle abundance was positively correlated with moisture and texture of CWD, degree of incorporation of CWD into the forest floor, and the amount of roots within CWD. There were significantly more TEM in CWD in young stands than in old stands and on sites with granitic soils than on sites with basaltic soils. Highly degraded CWD that is well incorporated in the forest floor appears to be an important microhabitat for the formation and occurrence of TEM. {\textcopyright} 2006 NRC.

AB  - This chapter focuses on various methods for studying fungi in soil and forest litter. Now, with the focus on nutrient cycling by fungi in whole ecosystems, bulky dead wood is also treated as an important constituent of a forest floor. The current upsurge in mycorrhizal research has also generated new approaches to integrated studies of fungi in soil, litter, and roots. Whatever the shortcomings of old and new methods of studying soil fungi, investigators' claims have tended to become more reliable with wider recognition that the use of sound statistical techniques when designing experiments and handling numerical data is essential. Statistical analyses are not discussed in this chapter, but some useful references are mentioned. The methods considered in the chapter have been divided into four broad categories: observation, isolation, quantification, and measurement of activity identification are also discussed in this chapter. {\textcopyright} 1990 Academic Press Limited

AB  - The diversity and spatial structure of soil fungi (SF) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities in the southern taiga forest litter were studied in sites with two contrasting contamination levels with copper smelter emissions. The operational taxonomic unit richness and evenness in the communities of both target groups decreased under contamination. The community structure of contaminated and control areas differed for SF, whereas they were similar for AMF. According to spatial structure analysis results on a scale of tens of meters, a gradual change of composition with distance was revealed for the SF community within 30-m intervals in the control sites. No spatial autocorrelation was found for AMF in the control sites. However, pronounced patchiness was characteristic of both SF and AMF communities within 10 m of contaminated sites. In the contaminated area, no specific spatial structure determinants of the studied communities was found among environmental factors such as water content, heavy metal concentrations in the forest litter, sample plot localization relative to canopy density, and herb vegetation diversity and abundance. However, in the control sites, AMF richness depended on herb abundance and litter chemistry. {\textcopyright} 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Managers use restorative fire and thinning for ecological benefits and to convert fuel-heavy forests to fuel-lean landscapes that lessen the threat of stand-replacing wildfire. In this study, we evaluated the long-term impact of thinning and prescribed fire on soil biochemistry and the mycorrhizal fungi associated with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Study sites were located in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon where prescribed fire treatments implemented in 1998 and thinning treatments in 2000 included prescribed fire, mechanical thinning of forested areas, a combination of thinning followed by fire, and an untreated control. Soil sampling for this study occurred in 2014 and included four replications of each treatment for a total of 16 experimental units. Differences among treatments in Bray-P, total C and N, and pH were likely driven by the thinning treatments and the resultant deposition of residual slash following harvesting or the consumption of slash by prescribed fire. Similar litter depths across treatments suggest that litter depth stabilizes over time in these forests. After more than a decade of recovery, mycorrhizal fungi in dry inland forests dominated by ponderosa pine that were subjected to fire returned to levels similar to the untreated controls. The results of this study demonstrate the resiliency of these forests to disturbances associated with restoration treatments, providing managers increased flexibility if maintaining abundant and persistent fungal communities for healthy soils is an objective. {\textcopyright} 2018

AB  - Ingrowth cores in the field were used to compare fine root characteristics of hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) among rooting substrate in the form of needle leaf litter, decomposing organic material, and mineral soil. Fine root growth, morphology, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations, and tissue C and N concentration were determined. The inorganic N leaching from each soil substrate was taken as a measure of N availability. Although there was no significant difference in total N leaching among substrates, more NH 4+-N leached from the decomposing organic material than other substrates. Rapid fine root production was observed in the organic material, whereas root production in the litter substrate was suppressed. Annual net fine root productions in litter, organic material, and mineral soil were 51, 193, and 132 g m-2, respectively. In the leaf litter substrate, AM colonization was suppressed and specific root length was higher than in the other substrates, indicating severe nutrient limitation in the litter. These responses of hinoki cypress roots seemed to be a soil exploitation pattern whereby absorptive fine roots were arranged to maximize nutrient acquisition. {\textcopyright} 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Fine root acclimation to different environmental conditions is crucial for growth and sustainability of forest trees. Relatively small changes in fine root standing biomass (FRB), morphology or mycorrhizal symbiosis may result in a large change in forest carbon, nutrient and water cycles. We elucidated the changes in fine root traits and associated ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi in 12 Norway spruce stands across a climatic and N deposition gradient from subarctic-boreal to temperate regions in Europe (68°N-48°N). We analysed the standing FRB and the ectomycorrhizal root tip biomass (EcMB, g m -2) simultaneously with measurements of the EcM root morphological traits (e.g. mean root length, root tissue density (RTD), N% in EcM roots) and frequency of dominating EcM fungi in different stands in relation to climate, soil and site characteristics. Latitude and N deposition explained the greatest proportion of variation in fine root traits. EcMB per stand basal area (BA) increased exponentially with latitude: by about 12.7 kg m -2 with an increase of 10° latitude from southern Germany to Estonia and southern Finland and by about 44.7 kg m -2 with next latitudinal 10° from southern to northern Finland. Boreal Norway spruce forests had 4.5 to 11 times more EcM root tips per stand BA, and the tips were 2.1 times longer, with 1.5 times higher RTD and about 1/3 lower N concentration. There was 19% higher proportion of root tips colonized by long-distance exploration type forming EcM fungi in the southern forests indicating importance of EcM symbiont foraging strategy in fine root nutrient acquisition. In the boreal zone, we predict ca. 50% decrease in EcMB per stand BA with an increase of 2 °C annual mean temperature. Different fine root foraging strategies in boreal and temperate forests highlight the importance of complex studies on respective regulatory mechanisms in changing climate. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Some species of Discomycetes develop fruit-bodies only on coniferous trees. At first they invade the bark of healthy trees and live as saprotrophic fungi. If a resistance of trees is weakened, these fungi change their way of life and become parasitic. When the tree dies, these fungi come back to the saprotrophic way of life. In accordance with literature data, 43 species of Discomycetes were reported on Pinus spp., 37 - on Abies, 18 - on Picea, 12 - on Larix. In coniferous forests, Discomycetes develop on attached and fallen needles and branches in the litter. In the latter case their number is smaller in comparison with wood-destroying species.

AB  - The interactions between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and mineral particles are critical for the stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) in terrestrial ecosystems. The processing of DOM by ectomycorrhizal fungi contributes to the formation of mineral-stabilized SOM by two contrasting pathways: the extracellular transformation of DOM (ex vivo pathway) and the secretion of mineral-surface-reactive metabolites (in vivo pathway). In this study, we examined how changes in nitrogen (N) availability affected the formation of mineral-associated carbon (C) from these two pathways. DOM was extracted from forest soils. The processing of this DOM by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus was examined in laboratory-scale studies with different levels of ammonium. At low levels of ammonium (i.e., under N-limited conditions), the DOM components were slightly oxidized, and fungal C metabolites with iron-reducing activity were secreted. Ammonium amendments decreased the amount of C metabolites, and no additional oxidation of the organic matter was detected. In contrast, the hydrolytic activity and the secretion of N-containing compounds increased, particularly when high levels of ammonium were added. Under these conditions, C, but not N, limited fungal growth. Although the overall production of mineral-associated organic C was not affected by ammonium concentrations, the observed shifts in the activities of the ex vivo and in vivo pathways affected the composition of organic matter adsorbed onto the mineral particles. Such changes will affect the properties of organic matter-mineral associations and, thus, ultimately, the stabilization of SOM. IMPORTANCE Nitrogen (N) availability plays a critical role in the cycling and storage of soil organic matter (SOM). However, large uncertainties remain in predicting the net effect of N addition on soil organic carbon (C) storage due to the complex interactions between organic matter, microbial activity, and mineral particles that determine the formation of stable SOM. Here, we attempted to disentangle the effects of ammonium on these interactions in controlled microcosm experiments including the ectomycorrhizal fungus P.involutus and dissolved organic matter extracted from forest soils. Increased ammonium levels affected the fungal processing of the organic material as well as the secretion of extracellular metabolites. Although ammonium additions did not increase the net production of mineral-adsorbed C, changes in the decomposition and secretion pathways altered the composition of the adsorbed organic matter. These changes may influence the properties of the organic mattermineral associations and, thus, the stabilization of SOM.

AB  - The relationship between mycorrhizal colonisation and phosphorus acquired by seedlings of the arbuscular mycorrhizal tree Oubanguia alata Bak f. (Scytopetalaceae) and the ectomycorrhizal tree Tetraberlinia moreliana Aubr. (Caesalpinioideae) was evaluated at low and high inorganic phosphorus availability. AM colonisation was positively correlated with phosphor us uptake by O. alata at low, but not at high phosphorus availability. Seedlings growth was positively related to arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation at both low and high phosphorus availability, suggesting that growth promotion by arbuscular mycorrhizas is not nr simply related to an increase of phosphorus uptake. In contrast, phosphorus uptake by T. moreliana was correlated with EM colonisation at both low and high phosphorus availability, but there was no relationship between growth and ectomycorrhizal colonisation. Promotion of phosphorus uptake by arbuscular mycorrhizas and ectomycorrhizas at low phosphorus availability is consistent with the cooccurrence of the two types of mycorrhiza in tropical rain forests where available soil phosphorus is low. However, ectomycorrhizal colonisation may also be of advantage where inputs of phosphorus rich litter raise the phosphorus status of the soil, as seen in the groves of ectomycorrhizal trees in Korup National Park, and may be one of the factors reinforcing local dominance by these trees.

AB  - Fungi play critical roles in ecosystem processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling, but have also been highlighted as significant contributors to organic matter build-up in boreal forest soils. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) mycelial biomass and necromass dynamics have recently been highlighted as essential for regulating build-up of soil organic matter. Understanding the extent to which shifts in mycelial community or growth trait composition cause changes in mycelial production and turnover over ecological gradients would aid a mechanistic understanding of these important processes at an ecosystem scale. Here, we test the hypotheses that shifting species and mycelial trait (exploration type) composition within the mycelial community underpin changes in biomass turnover with increasing forest age. We quantified mycelial turnover and assessed fungal community composition in a chronosequence of eight, 12- to 158-year-old, managed Pinus sylvestris forests. Turnover was estimated by determining mycelial biomass (ergosterol) in a sequence of ingrowth mesh bags and applying mathematical models. Fungal communities in the bags were identified using Pacific Biosciences sequencing of fungal ITS2 amplicons. To evaluate the accuracy of this method to represent all ECM fungi, community composition in bags was followed over time and compared with communities in soil. Mycelial communities changed with stand age, but we found no evidence that there were concurrent shifts in mycelial exploration types. Forest age and turnover were significantly correlated with ECM mycelial community composition and collectively explained 39.4% of total variation. The similarity between fungal communities in mesh bags and in soil was strongly forest age dependent, with communities in mesh bags diverging from soil communities in stands older than 60 years. However, in all stands, when bag incubation time exceeded 75 days, communities became more similar to soil communities. Synthesis. Our results support the idea that shifts in fungal community composition underpin the forest age-related decrease in mycelial turnover; however, since ingrowth mesh bags exclude some mycorrhizal species in older forests, it remains a possibility that turnover estimates were not reflecting the entire community. While we found no evidence that mycelial exploration types of fungi changed systematically with forest age, we suggest that other traits that relate to biomass turnover and necromass degradation require further study, as they may explain the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi regulate and contribute to soil organic matter accumulation. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Tree-killing forest disturbances such as storms and bark beetle outbreaks can lead to notable changes in the carbon (C) balance and functioning of forest ecosystems. In this study, the effects of a storm in 2010 followed by an outbreak of European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) on tree, litter and soil C stocks as well as humus layer C fractions and microbial community composition were examined in boreal Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) stands. Tree (aboveground), litter detritus (distinguishable twig, bark and cones) and soil (humus layer and 0–6 cm mineral soil) C stocks were quantified for undisturbed (living trees), storm disturbed (in 2010) and I. typographus disturbed (tree mortality in circa 2013–2014) plots in 2015–2016. Additional humus layer samples were collected in 2017 for determination of total microbial biomass C, ergosterol (fungal biomass indicator) and K2SO4 extractable (labile) C concentrations, as well as fungal and bacterial community composition (DNA sequencing). Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal mycelial growth in topsoil was also quantified. In spite of the differing initial development and intensity of the two disturbance types, there was little difference in humus layer C and microbiology between the storm and bark beetle disturbed plot types at the time of the study. This may be due to the longer time since the disturbance at the storm disturbed plots. The shift from tree biomass to necromass C stocks was not reflected in differences in SOC stocks or humus layer extractable C concentrations between undisturbed and disturbed plot types, but the amount of litter detritus on forest floor was similar (storm) or higher (beetle) in disturbed plots in comparison to undisturbed ones. Humus layer microbial biomass C and ergosterol concentrations and ECM fungal abundance were lower on disturbed plots in comparison to undisturbed plots. The disturbed plots were also indicated to have a slightly higher abundance of some saprotrophic fungi. Differences in the effects of the two disturbance types may occur when studied at differing spatial scales and at different times after disturbance. To understand the full impact of such disturbances on forest functioning and C balance, long-term monitoring studies will be required. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors

AB  - Gradient analysis is rarely used in studies of fungal communities. Data on macromycetes from eight sites along an elevation gradient in central Veracruz, Mexico, were used to demonstrate methods for gradient analysis that can be applied to studies of communities of fungi. Selected sites from 100 to 3,500 m altitude represent tropical dry forest, tropical montane cloud forest, conifer forest, and their ecotones. From May to October 2010, macromycetes were collected monthly within ten 10 × 10 m permanent plots per site. In total, 672 individuals of 213 species of macromycetes were recorded. Models for richness and diversity for all macromycete and ectomycorrhizal communities displayed peaks in the mid-part of the gradient, and a tendency to increase with elevation, whereas xylophagous fungi displayed a peak in the mid-lower part but tended to decrease with elevation. Cluster and Maximum Likelihood analyses distinguished four communities for both macromycetes and trees, but plant and fungal communities were only partly concordant. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that macromycete distribution along the gradient is related to slope, relative humidity, soil temperature, soil water content, canopy openness, and litter depth. Spearman's correlation and regression trees suggested that air and soil temperature, relative humidity, soil water content, canopy openness, vegetation structure and tree species richness were most strongly related to macrofungal functional groups, but these environmental variables were often correlated to the forest type and may not be causal. Variation in the environment along the elevation gradient differentially affected macromycete functional groups. Results from the different methods used in this work were concordant and showed significant patterns. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. (outside the USA).

AB  - On a global basis, peatlands are a major reserve of carbon (C). Hydrological changes can affect the decomposition processes in peatlands and in turn can alter their C balance. Since 1959, a groundwater extraction plant has generated a water-level gradient at our study site that has gradually changed part of the wet fen into a dry peatland forest. The average water-level drawdown of the gradient (from a pristine 9 cm to 26 cm in the dry end) is close to an estimate predicted by an increase in mean global temperature of 3°C. We studied the total microbial community of the aerobic surface peat in four locations along the gradient through phospholipid fatty acid and PCR-DGGE methods. Additionally, field measurements of soil respiration showed a threefold increase in the C-emission rate at the driest location compared with the wettest one, indicating enhanced decomposition. Also, both fungal and bacterial biomass increased in the drier locations. At the species level, the fungal community changed due to water-level drawdown whereas actinobacteria were less sensitive to drying. The majority of fungal sequences were similar to ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which dominated throughout the gradient. Our results indicate that ECM fungi might act as important facultative decomposers in organic-rich environments such as peatlands. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Tropical forests play a dominant role in the global carbon (C) cycle, and models predict increases in tropical net primary productivity (NPP) and C storage in response to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The extent to which increasing CO2 will enhance NPP depends in part on the availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to support growth. Some tropical trees can potentially overcome nutrient limitation by acquiring N via symbiotic dinitrogen (N2) fixation, which may provide a benefit in acquiring P via investment in N-rich phosphatase enzymes or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We conducted a seedling experiment to investigate the effects of elevated CO2 and soil nutrient availability on the growth of two N2-fixing and two non-N2-fixing tropical tree species. We hypothesized that under elevated CO2 and at low nutrient availability (i.e., low N and P), N2 fixers would have higher growth rates than non-N2 fixers because N2 fixers have a greater capacity to acquire both N and P. We also hypothesized that differences in growth rates between N2 fixers and non-N2 fixers would decline as nutrient availability increases because N2 fixers no longer have an advantage in nutrient acquisition. We found that the N2 fixers had higher growth rates than the non-N2 fixers under elevated CO2 and at low nutrient availability, and that the difference in growth rates between the N2 and non-N2 fixers declined as nutrient availability increased, irrespective of CO2. Overall, N2 fixation, root phosphatase activity, and AM colonization decreased with increasing nutrient availability, and increased under elevated CO2 at low nutrient availability. Further, AM colonization was positively related to the growth of the non-N2 fixers, whereas both N2 fixation and root phosphatase activity were positively related to the growth of the N2 fixers. Though our results indicate all four tree species have the capacity to up- or down-regulate nutrient acquisition to meet their stoichiometric demands, the greater capacity for the N2 fixers to acquire both N and P may enable them to overcome nutritional constraints to NPP under elevated CO2, with implications for the response of tropical forests to future environmental change. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - Understanding the post-senescent fate of fungal mycelium is critical to accurately quantifying forest carbon and nutrient cycling, but how this organic matter source decomposes in wood remains poorly studied. In this study, we compared the decomposition of dead fungal biomass (a.k.a. necromass) of two species, Mortierella elongata and Meliniomyces bicolor, in paired wood and soil plots in a boreal forest in northern Minnesota, USA. Mass loss was quantified at four time points over an 8-week incubation and the richness and composition of the fungal communities colonizing fungal necromass were characterized using high-throughput sequencing. We found that the structure of fungal decomposer communities in wood and soil differed, but, in both habitats, there was relatively rapid decay (∼30% remaining after 56 days). Mass loss was significantly faster in soil and for high-quality (i.e. high nitrogen and low melanin) fungal necromass. In both habitats, there was a clear trajectory of early colonization by opportunistic fungal taxa followed by colonization of fungi with greater enzymatic capacities to degrade more recalcitrant compounds, including white-rot and ectomycorrhizal fungi. Collectively, our results indicate that patterns emerging regarding substrate quality effects on fungal necromass decomposition in soil and leaf litter can be largely extended to fungal necromass decomposition in wood. {\textcopyright} 2020 FEMS.

AB  - Aim: The fine roots of trees may show plastic responses to their resource environment. Several, contrasting hypotheses exist on this plasticity, but empirical evidence for these hypotheses is scattered. This study aims to enhance our understanding of tree root plasticity by examining intra-specific variation in fine-root mass and morphology, fine-root growth and decomposition, and associated mycorrhizal interactions in beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests on soils that differ in resource availability. Methods: We measured the mass and morphological traits of fine roots (i.e. ≤ 2 mm diameter) sampled to 50 cm depth. Fine-root growth was measured with ingrowth cores, and fine-root decomposition with litter bags. Mycorrhizal fungal biomass was determined using ingrowth mesh bags. Results: Both tree species showed more than three times higher fine-root mass, and a ten-fold higher fine-root growth rate on sand than on clay, but no or marginal differences in overall fine-root morphology. Within the fine-root category however, beech stands had relatively more root length of their finest roots on clay than on sand. In the spruce stands, ectomycorrhizal mycelium biomass was larger on sand than on clay. Conclusions: In temperate beech and spruce forests, fine-root mass and mycorrhizal fungal biomass, rather than fine-root morphology, are changed to ensure uptake under different soil resource conditions. Yet enhancing our mechanistic understanding of fine-root trait plasticity and how it affects tree growth requires more attention to fine-root dynamics, the functional diversity within the fine-roots, and mycorrhizal symbiosis as an important belowground uptake strategy. {\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Fine root litter is the principal source of carbon stored in forest soils and a dominant source of carbon for fungal decomposers. Differences in decomposer capacity between fungal species may be important determinants of fine-root decomposition rates. Variable-retention harvesting (VRH) provides refuge for ectomycorrhizal fungi, but its influence on fine-root decomposers is unknown, as are the effects of functional shifts in these fungal communities on carbon cycling. We compared fungal communities decomposing fine roots (in litter bags) under VRH, clearcut, and uncut stands at two sites (6 and 13 years postharvest) and two decay stages (43 days and 1 year after burial) in Douglas fir forests in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Fungal species and guilds were identified from decomposed fine roots using high-throughput sequencing. Variable retention had short-term effects on beta-diversity; harvest treatment modified the fungal community composition at the 6-year-postharvest site, but not at the 13-year-postharvest site. Ericoid and ectomycorrhizal guilds were not more abundant under VRH, but stand age significantly structured species composition. Guild composition varied by decay stage, with ruderal species later replaced by saprotrophs and ectomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizal abundance on decomposing fine roots may partially explain why fine roots typically decompose more slowly than surface litter. Our results indicate that stand age structures fine-root decomposers but that decay stage is more important in structuring the fungal community than shifts caused by harvesting. The rapid postharvest recovery of fungal communities decomposing fine roots suggests resiliency within this community, at least in these young regenerating stands in coastal British Columbia. IMPORTANCE Globally, fine roots are a dominant source of carbon in forest soils, yet the fungi that decompose this material and that drive the sequestration or respiration of this carbon remain largely uncharacterized. Fungi vary in their capacity to decompose plant litter, suggesting that fungal community composition is an important determinant of decomposition rates. Variable-retention harvesting is a forestry practice that modifies fungal communities by providing refuge for ectomycorrhizal fungi. We evaluated the effects of variable retention and clear-cut harvesting on fungal communities decomposing fine roots at two sites (6 and 13 years postharvest), at two decay stages (43 days and 1 year), and in uncut stands in temperate rainforests. Harvesting impacts on fungal community composition were detected only after 6 years after harvest. We suggest that fungal community composition may be an important factor that reduces fine-root decomposition rates relative to those of above-ground plant litter, which has important consequences for forest carbon cycling.

AB  - Inoculation of ectomycorrhizal fungi to nursery-raised tree seedlings can improve survivorship and growth of them when transplanted into the field. This study investigated the effects of ectomycorrhizal inoculation using mycorrhizal tree on Shorea macrophylla seedlings, planted at different intervals, in a tropical nursery. Forest topsoil and river sand were mixed at a volumetric ratio of 1 : 1 as bedding medium. The non-mycorrhizal seedlings and a mycorrhizal tree were planted in a plastic container (length=75 cm, width = 25 cm, depth= 14 cm), with the seedlings spaced at 20-cm and 30-cm intervals from the tree. These seedlings were raised for 6 months at a nursery of the Lambir Hills National Park, Miri, Sarawak, Malaysia. Mycorrhizal formation percentage, dry matter weight, and nutrient content of the seedlings and soil properties of the bedding media were measured. The ectomycorrhizal infection could transfer from mycorrhizal tree to the seedlings by the elongation and connection of rhizomorph in both 20-cm- and 30-cminterval treatments. The ectomycorrhizal inoculation would be better when the seedlings were planted closer to mycorrhizal tree, i.e., at 20-cm interval. Early phase infection and greater mycorrhizal formation might improve nutrient acquisition such as N under poor nutrient condition.

AB  - Forest biogeochemical cycling is strongly influenced by the turnover of ectomycorrhizal fungal tissues. Fungal tissues may decompose differently from plant tissues due to their unique chemistry and may be important to understanding ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycles. Melanin is a recalcitrant, complex cell wall polymer commonly found in fungi. Melanin concentration varies significantly among species, which may contribute to the wide variation in their rates of decomposition previously observed. In a comparative experiment we examined decomposition of ectomycorrhizal fungi of varying melanin concentrations. In an additional experiment we examined the effect of melanin biosynthesis inhibition on decomposition of the highly melanized ectomycorrhizal fungus Cenococcum geophilum. Among species, initial melanin concentration was negatively correlated with decomposition while initial nitrogen concentration was positively correlated with decomposition. When melanin synthesis was inhibited, tissues of C. geophilum decomposed significantly faster. We conclude that melanin and nitrogen concentrations may control decomposition of ectomycorrhizal fungi as do lignin and nitrogen concentrations in plant material, and thus may have significant consequences for terrestrial carbon and nutrient cycling.

AB  - The production and mortality of extramatrical mycelia (EMM) of ectomycorrhizal fungi are poorly quantified despite their importance in soil carbon cycling in forests. Ingrowth bag/core methods are the most widely used but can not accurately assess temporal changes in EMM production and mortality, resulting in great uncertainty in annual estimates. A modified method using two mathematical models (Biomarker and Algebraic models) is proposed to quantify EMM production, mortality and decomposition over differing time periods by integrating EMM decomposition dynamics with ingrowth core/bag data. In the Biomarker model, EMM biomass and EMM total mass (sum of necromass and biomass) are assumed to be known by using chemical biomarkers as proxies. In the Algebraic model, only the total mass is known and the biomass is calculated using an algebraic method. Model application in a loblolly pine plantation showed that mean monthly EMM production, mortality and decomposition estimates among three time periods ranged from 10.1 to 16.0 kg ha−1, 6.6–15.0 kg ha−1, and 1.4–6.1 kg ha−1, respectively, when using the Biomarker model, while these estimates ranged from 24.8 to 35.7 kg ha−1, 15.5–22.8 kg ha−1, and 5.7–9.8 kg ha−1, respectively, when using the Algebraic model, demonstrating the importance of assessing temporal changes. Model validation indicated that EMM estimates were more reliable for short-term compared to long-term incubation (184 vs. 322 days). Our method could improve EMM estimation by accurately assessing temporal changes in EMM production, mortality and decomposition in forests. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is increasing interest in removing greater amounts of non-timber residues from forests for use in energy production. As part of a study aimed at elucidating the ecological impacts of these practices in Finland, piles of thinning residues of contrasting mass per unit area were established in 2004 around the base of individual Scots pine trees. As part of an NSF funded undergraduate training program, we have sampled the soil under these residue piles to evaluate the effect of leaving different amounts of residue on site to supply nutrients for remaining trees. Aboveground tree biomass production was significantly higher with higher levels of post-harvest residue retention. However, changes in soil chemistry were minimal and inconsistent with increasing residue amounts. Fine (<1 mm) tree root biomass showed little response to residue levels, but specific root length (length per unit mass) and ectomycorrhizal root tip abundance showed significant increases in the highest residue addition compared to the no-addition control. This may suggest a greater root searching strategy under high residue levels. There was no evidence of residue effect on soil nematodes but a consistent increase in abundance of 0-2 mm length enchytraeids with increased residue. This may be a result of higher rates of asexual reproduction under residues. Soil arthropod abundances did not correlate with residue levels. Even in this cold boreal forest ecosystem, it is possible that sampling 5 years after residue placement we may have missed some of the early influence of decomposition of more labile fractions of the residues on soil organisms and processes. It is likely that the current phase of woody material decomposition will have lesser effects on soil biology. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper identifies areas of mycorrhizal ecology that the authors believe are crucial for advancing our understanding of the role of mycorrhizas in forest ecosystems. Increased research is needed into the relationships between plant carbon fixation and allocation and nutrient acquisition by mycorrhizas in many forest ecosystems and for different plant physiological stages. These comparisons need to consider not only how symbiotic associations modify plant uptake of nutrients but the interactions between mycorrhizas and decomposer microbes and fauna, and how these interactions influence the conservation of, or competition for, available nutrients. The authors identify four areas of future study that should be accorded priority: (1) the cost-benefit ratio (to the host) of maintaining mycorrhizal fungi on roots and the optimal mycorrhizal biomass that can be supported before the cost-benefit ratio becomes unfavorable; (2) the significance of mycorrhizas in storing nutrients in ecosystems; (3) the significance of interconnecting (naturally grafted) roots relative to the links between different roots attributable to mycorrhizal hyphae; (4) the ability of mycorrhizal fungi to use complex organic substrates as sources of nutrients (such as N and P) in forests. {\textcopyright} 1991.

AB  - Litter species richness influences fungal diversity because of resource heterogeneity. Litter species composition effects on decomposition have been studied mostly in aboveground litter. However, little is known about the effects of litter diversity of roots and litter type effect on fungal diversity in general. We addressed litter species composition and richness effects on diversity of ectomycorrhizal (EcM), saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi in decomposing foliar and root litter in the Satakunta forest diversity experiment by varying litter species richness from one to four species in 560 litter bags incubated under tree canopies. After one year of decomposition, there were no significant non-additive effects of litter mixtures on mass loss. Litter species composition was the strongest predictor for saprotroph and plant pathogen community structure in foliar litter, but its effect on root litter fungal composition was much weaker. Litter diversity strongly enhanced fungal richness in foliar but not in root substrate. We found no evidence for host litter preferences in host-specific EcM fungi. Our study suggests that litter species richness and especially certain litter species may influence decomposition through modifying fungal community composition both in foliar and root litter.

AB  - Aims: We investigated the influence of tree species on the natural 15N abundance in forest stands under elevated ambient N deposition. Methods: We analysed $\delta$15N in litter, the forest floor and three mineral soil horizons along with ecosystem N status variables at six sites planted three decades ago with five European broadleaved tree species and Norway spruce. Results: Litter $\delta$15N and 15N enrichment factor ($\delta$15Nlitter-$\delta$15Nsoil) were positively correlated with N status based on soil and litter N pools, nitrification, subsoil nitrate concentration and forest growth. Tree species differences were also significant for these N variables and for the litter $\delta$15N and enrichment factor. Litter from ash and sycamore maple with high N status and low fungal mycelia activity was enriched in 15N (+0.9 delta units) relative to other tree species (European beech, pedunculate oak, lime and Norway spruce) even though the latter species leached more nitrate. Conclusions: The $\delta$15N pattern reflected tree species related traits affecting the N cycling as well as site fertility and former land use, and possibly differences in N leaching. The tree species $\delta$15N patterns reflected fractionation caused by uptake of N through mycorrhiza rather than due to nitrate leaching or other N transformation processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Communities of litter saprotrophic and root-associated fungi are vertically separated within boreal forest soil profiles. It is unclear whether this depth partitioning is maintained exclusively by substrate-mediated niche partitioning (i.e. distinct fundamental niches), or by competition for space and resources (i.e. distinct realized niches). Improved understanding of the mechanisms driving spatial partitioning of these fungal guilds is critical, as they modulate carbon and nutrient cycling in different ways. Under field settings, we tested the effects of substrate quality and the local fungal species pool at various depths in determining the potential of saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi to colonize and exploit organic matter. Natural substrates of three qualities – fresh or partly decomposed litter or humus – were incubated in the corresponding organic layers of a boreal forest soil profile in a fully factorial design. After one and two growing seasons, fungal community composition in the substrates was determined by 454-pyrosequencing and decomposition was analyzed. Fungal community development during the course of the experiment was determined to similar degrees by vertical location of the substrates (24% of explained variation) and by substrate quality (20%), indicating that interference competition is a strong additional driver of the substrate-dependent depth partitioning of fungal guilds in the system. During the first growing season, litter substrates decomposed slower when colonized by root-associated communities than when colonized by communities of litter saprotrophs, whereas humus was only slightly decomposed by both fungal guilds. During the second season, certain basidiomycetes from both guilds were particularly efficient in localizing and exploiting their native organic substrates although displaced in the vertical profile. This validates that fungal community composition, rather than microclimatic factors, were responsible for observed depth-related differences in decomposer activities during the first season. In conclusion, our results suggest that saprotrophic and root-associated fungal guilds have overlapping fundamental niches with respect to colonization of substrates of different qualities, and that their substrate-dependent depth partitioning in soils of ectomycorrhiza-dominated ecosystems is reinforced by interference competition. Through competitive interactions, mycorrhizal fungi can thus indirectly regulate litter decomposition rates by restraining activities of more efficient litter saprotrophs.

AB  - Mycorrhiza is the most ancient and widespread mutualistic symbiotic association between plants and soil borne fungi. Mycorrhizae sensu lato are dual organs of absortion formed by mutualistic symbiotic fungi inhabiting healthy absorbing organs such as roots, rhizomes or thalli of most terrestrial plants and also many aquatics and epiphytes. In nature the soil nutrient acquisition of plants occurs to great extent via these mycorrhizal organs. It is now widely accepted that mycorrhizae would have played a fundamental role in the colonization of the land by plants functioning as nutrient absorbing structures even before the appearance of roots. Mycorrhizae are traditionally classified into categories on the basis of their fungal partners and macro-and microscopical anatomical structures of the dual organs. Among them ectomycorrhiza (ECM) is typically formed between the fine roots of trees of boreal and temperate forest and fungal species usually belonging to Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. In this chapter we discuss the evolutionary origin of ECM, some of its morphological and anatomical characters, the ecological significance of ECM and some of the molecular traits related to establishment and functioning of ECM structures between fungi and their plant hosts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Discusses the influence of root pathogens and mycorrhizas in plant communities, paying special attention to their relationship to plant-plant interactions and the species composition of the vegetation. Phytophthora cinnamomi in Australian forests is taken as an example of a root pathogen that can have substantial effects on the species composition of native vegetation. In recent decades it has caused conspicuous death of Eucalyptus and other species in forest in W and SE Australia. In Victoria marked changes in the species composition of open Eucalyptus woodland caused by P. cinnamomi epidemic have been documented over 20 yr, and there are signs that an equilibrium between fungus and vegetation may be developing in some areas. A pot experiment showed VA-mycorrhiza having little effect on the growth of Lolium perenne and Plantago lanceolata when they were separate, but greatly increasing the ability of P; lanceolata to continue growth when in the presence of L. perenne. When leaves of dicotyledonous tree species are compared, ectomycorrhizal species usually have a higher N:P ratio than VA-mycorrhizal species. This could be because of greater ability by ectomycorrhizal species to obtain N from proteins in litter. The leaf litter of ectomycorrhizal trees usually decomposes more slowly than that of VA-mycorrhizal trees. These differences may have important implications when species of the two types grow together. -from Author

AB  - The CENTURY model of soil organic matter turn-over developed by Parton and co-workers has been used successfully for grasslands to predict dynamics of C, N and other nutrients. It was tested here for decomposition of a range of forest litters and for N mineralisation in forest soils. Modifications to the CENTURY model were necessary to match model output to empirical findings. These modifications included: (1) incorporation of additional woody litter pools (i.e. fine-wood and coarse-wood) (2) allowing the N content of soil organic matter (SOM) pools to vary (3) constraining N mineralisation and immobilisation to the active SOM pool (4) incorporation of a small flux of mineral N to the resistant SOM pool (5) allowance of mycorrhizal uptake of N, and (6) re-formulation of temperature and moisture effects on decomposition. Other possible changes, such as giving greater flexibility to the critical N concentration for mineralisation, were tested but found not to improve model performance. The modified model largely accounted for the effects of initial lignin and N concentration on subsequent litter decomposition rate, litter N concentrations and critical N concentrations for the commencement of mineralisation. Consequently, the model could successfully simulate realistic time courses of N immobilisation and subsequent mineralisation for a range of litter types. The present model also successfully predicted the critical N concentration for N mineralisation across a wide range of litter samples from forests and other vegetation sources. Net mineralisation was successfully simulated in forest soils, which were either untreated, irrigated or fertilised. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plants have numerous impacts on biogeochemical cycling across both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. These effects extend well beyond the critical role of carbon (C) fixation through photosynthesis that provides the basis for ecosystem energy flow. While foliar and root traits of senescent plant material (litter) have been explored in detail in terrestrial ecosystems, there is a resurgence of interest in how plants modulate biogeochemical cycling in ways other than litter quality effects on C and nutrient mineralization. This Special Feature represents a collection of 'fresh' perspectives on how plants alone, or in interaction with other organisms, have important and lasting impacts on biogeochemical cycles of C and nutrients in a range of terrestrial and aquatic environments. We begin in the open ocean and then peer from the forest edge before moving into forest understoreys and grasslands to examine the control by live terrestrial plants on ecosystem C and nutrient cycling. Plants directly affect biogeochemical cycling while living through their diversity and composition, nutrient capture and strategies for assimilating C, and by altering the microclimate for decomposition. In addition, how they construct their tissues and alter the abiotic environment has large impacts on the turnover of C and nutrients once plants have senesced or died. From the direct impact of plants, we move onto the influence of plant-insect interactions, which effectively determine changes in plant stoichiometry in grasslands of varying diversity. Finally, looking directly in the soil, it is clear that plant-mycorrhizae interactions are important in modulating the response of litter decomposition to nutrient addition and the nature of C metabolism in the soil. Synthesis. The papers here highlight careful matching between how plants live and their biotic and abiotic contexts. Taken together, it appears that the dynamic, rather than passive, nature of plant responses to variable environments is key in affecting ecosystem level processes of C and nutrient turnover. This Special Feature highlights a diversity of connections between plants and their environment and demonstrates that in both life and death, how plants respond to these changes differs among plant lineages and this diversity will play a central role in determining biogeochemical cycling in the future in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - We assessed the nutritional strategy of true morels (genus Morchella) collected in 2003 and 2004 in Oregon and Alaska, 1 or 2 y after forest fires. We hypothesized that the patterns of stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in the sporocarps would match those of saprotrophic fungi and that radiocarbon (Delta C-14) analyses would indicate that Morchella was assimilating old carbon not current-year photosynthate. We compared radiocarbon and stable isotopes in Morchella with values from concurrently collected foliage, the ectomycorrhizal Geopyxis carbonaria (Alb. \& Schwein.) Sacc., the saprotrophic Plicaria endocarpoides (Berk.) Rifai, and with literature to determine isotopic values for ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic fungi. Geopyxis, Plicaria and Morchella, respectively, were 3 parts per thousand, 5 parts per thousand and 6 parts per thousand higher in C-13 than foliage and 5 parts per thousand, 7 parts per thousand and 7 parts per thousand higher in N-15. High N-15 enrichment in Morchella indicated that recent litter was not the primary source for Morchella nitrogen, and similar C-13 and N-15 enrichments to Plicaria suggest that Morchella assimilates its carbon and nitrogen from the same source pool as this saprotrophic fungus. From radiocarbon analyses Morchella averaged 11 +/- 6 y old (n = 19), Plicaria averaged 17 +/- 5 y old (n = 3), foliage averaged 1 +/- 2 y old (n = 8) and Geopyxis (n = 1) resembled foliage in Delta C-14. We conclude that morels fruiting in post-fire environments in our study assimilated old carbon and were saprotrophic.

AB  - An annotated list is provided of 906 taxa of fungi (including oomycetes and myxomycetes) which have been recorded in New Zealand in close association with the five endemic taxa of Nothofagus (southern beech), as ectomycorrhizal mycobionts, pathogens, or saprobes causing decay of wood and leaves. The list has been compiled from data associated with specimens held in Herbarium PDD and in Herbarium NZFRI(M), and from the literature. Nothofagus forests are an important conservation resource, and a vast storehouse for New Zealand fungi; approximately 35% of the known New Zealand agaric mycota are associated with Nothofagus, and 50% of the known polypore species. Of the 226 named species of ectomycorrhizal fungi found in New Zealand beech forests (205 agarics, 19 Aphyllophorales — clavarioid, hydnoid, etc., 1 as-comycete, 1 mitosporic fungus), about 90% are native, with most of these being endemic. Six mycorrhizal agaric genera are especially well represented: Amanita (11 species), Cortinarius (57 speties), Democybe (11 species), Inocybe (13 species), Russula (23 species), and Thaxterogaster (13 species). Few pathogens have been recorded. The most conspicuous of these are three Cyttaria spp. (beech strawberries) found only on N. menziesii. Two mitosporic fungi, Nodulisporium sp. and Sporothrix sp., in association with various insects, may be partially responsible for beech forest decline. Sooty mould fungi, growing on honeydew secreted by scale insects, produce conspicuous black growth on beech trees. Such growth can be caused by representatives of 10 genera of ascomycetes and mitosporic fungi, many of which also grow on other host plants. Large numbers of saprobic fungi are recorded on beech wood or twigs and leaf litter, and some of these cause economically significant wood rots and sapstain. {\textcopyright} 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Forests associating with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi may have distinct belowground carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycle processes. However, there are little available data providing evidence for the effects of trees associating with mycorrhizal type on belowground C and N cycling in forest ecosystems in China. Here, we collected a database of 26 variables related to belowground C and N cycling from 207 studies covering 209 sampling sites in China, to better understand the variations in belowground C and N cycling between the two mycorrhizal types in forest ecosystems along a climatic gradient. The AM forests had significantly lower soil total C and N contents, and soil microbial biomass C and N, than ECM forests, probably due to differences in litter quality (N and C/N) between AM and ECM forest types. In contrast, AM forests had significantly higher litter input, litter decomposition and soil respiration than ECM forests. Temperature and precipitation had significant positive effects on litter input and decomposition, soil total C and N contents, and soil respiration in AM and ECM forests. Overall, our results indicated that mycorrhizal type strongly affected belowground C and N cycle processes in forest ecosystems. Moreover, AM forests are likely more sensitive and ECM forests have a greater ability to adapt to global climate change. {\textcopyright} 2020 CSIRO.

AB  - Mean annual temperature (MAT) is an influential climate factor affecting the bioavailability of growth-limiting nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). In tropical montane wet forests, warmer MAT drives higher N bioavailability, while patterns of P availability are inconsistent across MAT. Two important nutrient acquisition strategies, fine root proliferation into bulk soil and root association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, are dependent on C availability to the plant via primary production. The case study presented here tests whether variation in bulk soil N bioavailability across a tropical montane wet forest elevation gradient (5.2°C MAT range) influences (a) morphology fine root proliferation into soil patches with elevated N, P, and N+P relative to background soil and (b) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonization of fine roots in patches. We created a fully factorial fertilized root ingrowth core design (N, P, N+P, unfertilized control) representing soil patches with elevated N and P bioavailability relative to background bulk soil. Our results show that percent AMF colonization of roots increased with MAT (r2 =.19, p =.004), but did not respond to fertilization treatments. Fine root length (FRL), a proxy for root foraging, increased with MAT in N+P-fertilized patches only (p =.02), while other fine root morphological parameters did not respond to the gradient or fertilized patches. We conclude that in N-rich, fine root elongation into areas with elevated N and P declines while AMF abundance increases with MAT. These results indicate a tradeoff between P acquisition strategies occurring with changing N bioavailability, which may be influenced by higher C availability with warmer MAT. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Mycorrhizae are important in the functioning of forest ecosystems worldwide, and play a critical role in water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and prevention of feeder root disease. The majority of mycorrhizal research has been conducted on upland sites, especially in coniferous ecosystems and in commercial agricultural production. However, the maintenance and restoration of bottomland hardwood (BLH) forest ecosystems in the southern United States is of increasing concern. Both ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae are present in BLH forests, although the dominance of one or the other type depends primarily on both the tree species and the hydrologie regime. Ectomycorrhizae tend to be more sensitive to flooding, while endomycorrhizal infection can be present even in permanently flooded soils. The mycorrhizae of sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and the oaks (Quercus spp.) have been studied most due to their economic importance. Considerable work is still needed to better understand mycorrhizal relationships in BLH ecosystems and associated trees, both with respect to infectivity and nutrient cycling. Such information may be necessary for restoration of BLH forests on old agricultural fields, or to maintain the productivity of BLH forests after harvest. This paper summarizes studies on mycorrhizae relationships in BLH forests and suggests future work necessary for understanding the role mycorrhizae can have in managing these ecosystems.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are an important component of the Pinus patula Schlechdt. et Cham. forest ecosystem in Mpumalanga, South Africa. ECM roots are intimately associated with accumulated litter on the forest floor and four ECM isolates where examined to determine whether they provide plant access to inorganic and organic sources of nitrogen (N) and inorganic, complexed inorganic and organic sources of phosphorus (P). In in vitro studies, all isolates were found to utilize most of the organic N compounds and organic or complexed inorganic P compounds supplied. Thus, ECM fungi could play a significant role in providing N and P to P. patula, especially from sources to which the host plant would not normally have access. Temperature sensitivities and pH optima of the four isolates differed. Of the ECM isolates WITS 01 and WITS 06 were collected from a high-litter site: WITS 01 mycorrhizas, identified as Scleroderma citrinum, were white, smooth and dichotomously branched with smooth, pale yellow, differentiated rhizomorphs. The mantle was plectenchymatous with outer and inner layers showing ring-like arrangements of hyphal bundles. The Hartig net had a palmetti shape. The WITS 02 (not identified) mycorrhizas were brown with lighter coloured root tips, with simple to dichotomous branching, smooth with no distinct mantle and sparse hyphae occurred on the root surface. The Hartig net was palmetti type with lobed haustoria. The results are discussed in relation to ECM distribution and function in nutrient cycling.

AB  - Abstract: The results of monitoring the biota of agaricoid basidiomycetes in spruce forests (riverbank spruce and wood sorrel spruce forest) in the subzone of the southern taiga of Perm krai for 40 years are summed up. To date, 336 species and intraspecific taxa of agaricoid basidiomycetes belonging to 73 genera and 16 families have been found in spruce forests. The species of the families Tricholomataceae, Cortinariaceae, and Russulaceae predominate, which is typical for the boreal zone of Eurasia. The largest number of species is found in the genera Cortinarius (43 species), Mycena (39), Russula (25), and Lactarius (13), which is typical of the southern taiga subzone. It is noted that the species composition of agaricoid basidiomycetes changes with time to a greater extent (Jacquard's coefficients (J × 100): riverbank spruce forest: J = 44–50; sorrel spruce forest: J = 43–47) than the species composition of higher vascular plants (J = 69–88). Many common features are revealed between the species composition of fungi of spruce forests (J = 49). Over the entire period of observations in spruce forests, 16 species dominating in the number of basidiomas and 19–21 species dominating in the biomass of basidiomas have been identified. As a result of the analysis of the ecological–trophic structure of the studied biogeocenoses, mycorrhiza-forming agents predominate (37.4–43.5%). The relationship between the diversity and productivity of agaricoid fungi with the main climatic indicators (May–September) is studied. It is found that an increase in the average monthly air temperature in August leads to a decrease in the number of xylotroph basidiomas in the sorrel spruce forest (rs = –0.7) and the basidiom litter saprotrophs biomass in the riverbank spruce forest (rs = –0.7). Heavy rainfall in August contributes to a reduction in the number of basidiomas of litter saprotrophs in the riverbank fir forest (rs = –0.7). {\textcopyright} 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Temperature and substrate availability constrain the activity of the extracellular enzymes that decompose and release nutrients from soil organic matter (SOM). Proteolytic enzymes are the primary class of enzymes involved in the depolymerization of nitrogen (N) from proteinaceous components of SOM, and their activity affects the rate of N cycling in forest soils. The objectives of this study were to determine whether and how temperature and substrate availability affect the activity of proteolytic enzymes in temperate forest soils, and whether the activity of proteolytic enzymes and other enzymes involved in the acquisition of N (i.e., chitinolytic and ligninolytic enzymes) differs between trees species that form associations with either ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Temperature limitation of proteolytic enzyme activity was observed only early in the growing season when soil temperatures in the field were near 4°C. Substrate limitation to proteolytic activity persisted well into the growing season. Ligninolytic enzyme activity was higher in soils dominated by ectomycorrhizal associated tree species. In contrast, the activity of proteolytic and chitinolytic enzymes did not differ, but there were differences between mycorrhizal association in the control of roots on enzyme activity. Roots of ectomycorrhizal species but not those of arbuscular mycorrhizal species exerted significant control over proteolytic, chitinolytic, and ligninolytic enzyme activity; the absence of ectomycorrhizal fine roots reduced the activity of all three enzymes. These results suggest that climate warming in the absence of increases in substrate availability may have a modest effect on soil-N cycling, and that global changes that alter belowground carbon allocation by trees are likely to have a larger effect on nitrogen cycling in stands dominated by ectomycorrhizal fungi. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Wood-inhabiting fungi (WIF) are pivotal to wood decomposition, which in turn strongly influences nutrient dynamics in forest soils. However, their dispersal mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that the majority of WIF are soil-borne. For this reason, the presented research aimed to quantify the contribution of soil as a source and medium for the dispersal of WIF to deadwood using high-throughput sequencing. We tested effects of tree species (specifically Schima superba and Pinus massoniana) on the percentage of WIF shared between soil and deadwood in a Chinese subtropical forest ecosystem. We also assessed the taxonomic and ecological functional group affiliations of the fungal community shared between soil and deadwood. Our results indicate that soil is a major route for WIF colonization as 12%–15% (depending on the tree species) of soil fungi were simultaneously detected in deadwood. We also demonstrate that tree species (p < 0.01) significantly shapes the composition of the shared soil and deadwood fungal community. The pH of decomposing wood was shown to significantly correspond (p < 0.01) with the shared community of wood-inhabiting (of both studied tree species) and soil fungi. Furthermore, our data suggest that a wide range of fungal taxonomic (Rozellida, Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota) and ecological functional groups (saprotrophs, ectomycorrhizal, mycoparasites, and plant pathogens) may use soil as a source and medium for transport to deadwood in subtropical forest ecosystem. While 12%–62% of saprotrophic, ectomycorrhizal, and mycoparasitic WIF may utilize soil to colonize deadwood, only 5% of the detected plant pathogens were detected in both soil and deadwood, implying that these fungi use other dispersal routes. Animal endosymbionts and lichenized WIF were not detected in the soil samples. Future studies should consider assessing the relative contributions of other possible dispersal mechanisms (e.g. wind, water splash, water dispersal, animal dispersal, and mycelial network) in the colonization of deadwood by soil fungi. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

AB  - This review critically examines the role of boron (B) in forests in view of recent findings on B nutrition and the continuing occurrence of B deficiency. Many perceptions about the role of B in plants and its uptake and mobility have been altered since the last review on B in forest trees in 1990. Now there is evidence for a fundamental role of B in the formation of the pectic structure in primary cell walls in plants, and further roles in membrane function are being explored. In plants, channel-mediated B uptake, active B uptake and B uptake by mycorrhizas have been shown, B transporters have been identified, and B retranslocation has been shown. We explore these findings and their consequences on forest trees and on ecosystems that they dominate. Particular emphasis is placed on B retranslocation and B in mycorrhizal symbiosis, given their importance in trees. Following from impaired development of the primary cell wall in B-deficient trees, disorders in the structural development of organs and whole plants are manifested. This has consequences for tree form, affecting wood quality and productivity. At a stand level, at least part of the value of wood production is lost by the time the deficiency symptoms appear. As symptoms identifying deficiency in many tree species are too easily confused with many other effects, greater use should be made of foliar analysis but this requires establishing robust prognostic values for the trees of interest. There is still no explanation as to why root tip and mycorrhiza development are among the first phenomena to be affected as the B supply decreases. Whether B is required by, or whether it is useful for fungi, is still an open question. Boron remobilisation within trees may be a key factor in the occurrence of forests in areas with very low B availability, as most of the B in the whole stand can be in the standing biomass. The ability to remobilise B varies considerably between species, but we suggest that there is a continuum rather than a strict division to B-retranslocating and non-retranslocating species. Boron output from forest ecosystems with potential for leaching is controlled by adsorption in the soil, which is still poorly understood particularly in soils with abundant organic matter. Increased concentrations of phenolic compounds in B-deficient plants and possibly altered lignin concentration can affect plant defence systems to herbivory and pathogens, and nutrient and carbon release through decomposition. Hence, B nutrition and fertilisation of low-B stands can have implications both to the resistance of trees to biotic stress, as well as influence the cycles of other nutrients and carbon in forests.

AB  - Vaccinium myrtillus L. ground vegetation in boreal forests reduces tree seedling survival and growth. We studied below- and above-ground competition and phytotoxicity of V. myrtillus on transplanted Picea abies (L.) Karst. seedlings in a 3-year full factorial field experiment. Exclusion tubes were used to reduce and selectively test for belowground competition by V. myrtillus. Shoots of V. myrtillus were folded back to reduce aboveground competition. Reduced belowground competition by V. myrtillus increased P. abies current-year shoot length, shoot and root biomass, seedling nutrient concentration, and mycorrhizal colonization. Reduced aboveground competition affected P. abies seedling root biomass positively whereas seedling survival, shoot length, and shoot/root ratio were negatively affected. Addition of activated carbon to the soil surface to reduce the effect of possible phytotoxic leachates from V. myrtillus leaves and litter had no effects on P. abies seedling survival and growth. No significant interactions among treatments were found. We conclude that suppressed growth of P. abies seedlings in V. myrtillus sites of northern boreal forests is caused mainly by belowground resource competition.

AB  - Introduction The mycelium of woodland fungi can act both as a reservoir and as a distribution system for nutrients, owing to its physiological and developmental adaptations to life at the interface between organic and mineral soil horizons. The mobility of accumulated nitrogen and phosphorus within the mycelial networks of cord-forming wood decay fungi and ectomycorrhiza enables fungi to play key roles as wood decomposers and root symbionts. The dynamics of nitrogen movement have been less investigated than phosphorus owing to lack of a suitable tracer. We have developed a new technique for tracing nitrogen translocation in real time, using 14C as a marker for nitrogen by incorporating it into a nondecomposed amino acid that tracks the mycelial free amino acid pool. Its movement can be imaged by counting photon emissions from a scintillant screen in contact with the mycelial system. This method allows real-time imaging at high temporal and spatial resolution, for periods of weeks and areas up to 1m2, in microcosms that mimic the mineral/organic soil interface of the forest floor. The results reveal a hitherto unsuspected dynamism and responsiveness in amino acid flows through mycelial networks of cord-forming, wood-decomposing basidiomycetes. We interpret these in the light of current understanding of the pivotal role of fungi in boreal and temperate forest floor nutrient cycling, and attempt to formulate key questions to investigate the effects of mycelial nitrogen translocation on forest floor decomposition and nitrogen absorption. {\textcopyright} British Mycological Society 2006.

AB  - Rising atmospheric [CO2] has the potential to alter soil carbon (C) cycling by increasing the content of recalcitrant constituents in plant litter, thereby decreasing rates of decomposition. Because fine root turnover constitutes a large fraction of annual NPP, changes in fine root decomposition are especially important. These responses will likely be affected by soil resource availability and the life history characteristics of the dominant tree species. We evaluated the effects of elevated atmospheric [CO2] and soil resource availability on the production and chemistry, mycorrhizal colonization, and decomposition of fine roots in an early- and late-successional tree species that are economically and ecologically important in north temperate forests. Open-top chambers were used to expose young trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) trees to ambient (36 Pa) and elevated (56 Pa) atmospheric CO2. Soil resource availability was composed of two treatments that bracketed the range found in the Upper Lake States, USA. After 2.5 years of growth, sugar maple had greater fine root standing crop due to relatively greater allocation to fine roots (30% of total root biomass) relative to aspen (7% total root biomass). Relative to the low soil resources treatment, aspen fine root biomass increased 76% with increased soil resource availability, but only under elevated [CO2]. Sugar maple fine root biomass increased 26% with increased soil resource availability (relative to the low soil resources treatment), and showed little response to elevated [CO2]. Concentrations of N and soluble phenolics, and C/N ratio in roots were similar for the two species, but aspen had slightly higher lignin and lower condensed tannins contents compared to sugar maple. As predicted by source-sink models of carbon allocation, pooled constituents (C/N ratio, soluble phenolics) increased in response to increased relative carbon availability (elevated [CO2]/low soil resource availability), however, biosynthetically distinct compounds (lignin, starch, condensed tannins) did not always respond as predicted. We found that mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots was not strongly affected by atmospheric [CO2] or soil resource availability, as indicated by root ergosterol contents. Overall, absolute changes in root chemical composition in response to increases in C and soil resource availability were small and had no effect on soil fungal biomass or specific rates of fine root decomposition. We conclude that root contributions to soil carbon cycling will mainly be influenced by fine root production and turnover responses to rising atmospheric [CO2], rather than changes in substrate chemistry. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.

AB  - Leaf-cutter ants are a prominent feature in Neotropical ecosystems, but a comprehensive assessment of their effects on ecosystem functions is lacking. We reviewed the literature and used our own recent findings to identify knowledge gaps and develop a framework to quantify the effects of leaf-cutter ants on ecosystem processes. Leaf-cutter ants disturb the soil structure during nest excavation changing soil aeration and temperature. They mix relatively nutrient-poor soil from deeper layers with the upper organic-rich layers increasing the heterogeneity of carbon and nutrients within nest soils. Leaf-cutter ants account for about 25% of all herbivory in Neotropical forest ecosystems, moving 10%–15% of leaves in their foraging range to their nests. Fungal symbionts transform the fresh, nutrient-rich vegetative material to produce hyphal nodules to feed the ants. Organic material from roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi enhances carbon and nutrient turnover in nest soils and creates biogeochemical hot spots. Breakdown of organic matter, microbial and ant respiration, and nest waste material decomposition result in increased CO2, CH4, and N2O production, but the build-up of gases and heat within the nest is mitigated by the tunnel network ventilation system. Nest ventilation dynamics are challenging to measure without bias, and improved sensor systems would likely solve this problem. Canopy gaps above leaf-cutter ant nests change the light, wind and temperature regimes, which affects ecosystem processes. Nests differ in density and size depending on colony age, forest type and disturbance level and change over time resulting in spatial and temporal changes of ecosystem processes. These characteristics remain a challenge to evaluate rapidly and non-destructively. Addressing the knowledge gaps identified in this synthesis will bring insights into physical and biological processes driving biogeochemical cycles at the nest and ecosystem scale and will improve our understanding of ecosystem biogeochemical heterogeneity and larger scale ecological phenomena.

AB  - Root traits vary enormously among plant species but we have little understanding of how this variation affects their functioning. Of central interest is how root traits are related to plant resource acquisition strategies from soil. We examined root traits of 33 woody species from northeastern US forests that form two of the most common types of mutualisms with fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) and ectomycorrhizas (EM). We examined root trait distribution with respect to plant phylogeny, quantifying the phylogenetic signal (K statistic) in fine root morphology and architecture, and used phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) to test whether taxa forming different mycorrhizal associations had different root traits. We found a pattern of species forming roots with thinner diameters as species diversified across time. Given moderate phylogenetic signals (K = 0.44-0.68), we used PICs to examine traits variation among taxa forming AM or EM, revealing that hosts of AM were associated with lower branching intensity (r<inf>PIC</inf> = -0.77) and thicker root diameter (r<inf>PIC</inf> = -0.41). Because EM evolved relatively more recently and intermittently across plant phylogenies, significant differences in root traits and colonization between plants forming AM and EM imply linkages between the evolution of these biotic interactions and root traits and suggest a history of selection pressures, with trade-offs for supporting different types of associations. Finally, across plant hosts of both EM and AM, species with thinner root diameters and longer specific root length (SRL) had less colonization (r<inf>PIC</inf> = 0.85, -0.87), suggesting constraints on colonization linked to the evolution of root morphology. We examined root traits of 33 woody species co-existing in Northeastern US forests that form two of the most common types of mutualisms with fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) and ectomycorrhizas (EM). We found patterns of plants forming roots with thinner diameters as species diversified across time; and that the AM habit was associated with lower branching intensity (r<inf>PIC</inf> = -0.77) and thicker root diameter (r<inf>PIC</inf> = -0.41) and the EM habit. We discuss findings in light of selection pressures on root traits and trade-offs for supporting different types of fungal symbionts. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Microbes involved in decomposition within peatlands and the conditions that influence their activities have implications for C and greenhouse gas exchange. The objectives of this research were to characterize the role of fungal and bacterial activities in peatlands using selective antibiotic inhibition techniques across a nutrient gradient (rich to poor fens) and to search for environmental controls on the activity of each group. Bacterial activities predominated across a range of rich to poor boreal peatlands in central Ontario, Canada, although fungal activity became increasingly important in the poor sites. Linkages between soil pH and nutrient status and fungal and bacterial activities were found. However, they did not confirm our initial hypotheses that bacterial activity would be low in poor sites due to proton stress and low nutrient (particularly N) availability, whereas, fungal activity would be low in rich sites due to increased competitive ability of bacteria under near neutral pH conditions and high nutrient availability. Further work across these sites aimed at characterizing the phylogeny of the rhizosphere fungi is needed to determine if increased presence of mycorrhizae in poor sites could have explained our observed patterns. However, regardless of fungal: bacterial activity ratio differences across sites and its associated controls, microbial CO 2 production rates across fen types did not vary significantly, suggesting that the proportion of bacteria and fungi may not matter to broader carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in peat soils. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - A 3 year field and pot study was conducted to determine the effects of several biotic and abiotic factors on the early growth of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), western redcedar (Thuja plicata, Donn) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis, Bong. Carr.) seedlings established on 2- and 8-year-old clearcut sites previously occupied by old-growth western hemlock and western redcedar forests (referred to as younger and older CH, respectively), and on adjacent 2-year-old clearcut sites previously occupied by second-growth western hemlock and amabilis fir (Amabilis amabilis (Dougl.) Forbes) forests (referred to as younger HA) in coastal British Columbia. The objective of the study was to determine which factors are associated with the poor growth characteristic of the salal (Gaultheria shallon, Pursh) dominated CH clearcut sites. No soil moisture deficits were measured on any of the three types of clearcut sites at any time of year. The best seeding growth was on the younger HA sites followed by the younger CH sites and then the older CH sites. The better growth on the younger HA sites was associated with a higher availability of N and P in the first 20 cm depth of the forest floor. No differences in matric soil water potential and pH, and only small differences in soil temperature were measured between the three types of clearcut sites. Complete removal of the competing vegetation on the younger and older CH sites resulted in an increase in conifer seedling growth and in the availability of N (22-40\%) and P (15-32\%); however, it did not affect cellulose decomposition and matric soil water potential, and increased soil temperature only slightly. Both western hemlock and Sitka spruce seedlings were very responsive to differences in nutrient availability measured between types of clearcut sites and planting treatments. In contrast, western redcedar was not responsive. All three conifer species had very high mycorrhizal colonization on the younger CH sites, and this was not altered by the removal of the competing vegetation (mainly salal). These results suggest that the nutritional stress and poor growth of conifers on salal-dominated CH clearcut sites in coastal British Columbia can be explained by: (1) inherently low forest floor nutrient availability; (2) competition between salal and conifer seedlings for scarce nutrients and nutrient immobilization in salal; (3) declining nutrient availability a few years after clearcutting and slashburning.

AB  - Plant-soil feedback (PSF) can provide a driving force during ecological succession by altering soil properties in ways that benefit or disadvantage other species in the successional sequence. Succession may be inevitable in disturbed sites remediated by planting early successional species, but information on PSF in such settings is lacking. We investigated whether gray birch (Betula populifolia), a native species but strong invader, alters succession from grassland to deciduous forest at a site contaminated with zinc, lead, and cadmium. We investigated PSF within the context of competition, herbivory, and soil contaminants, and evaluated whether gray birch, as a high metal accumulator, engages in elemental allelopathy, poisoning other species through its metal-contaminated leaf litter. We assessed the effects of gray birch on neighboring plant community structure, soil chemistry, fungal root symbionts, and the germination, growth, and herbivory of seedlings of black oak (Quercus velutina) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum), two tree species expected to follow gray birch in succession. Gray birch was associated with increased diversity in its neighborhood grassland community, increased herbivory on black oak seedlings, and influenced colonization by fungal root symbionts in both species. Seedling biomass was correlated with colonization by ectomycorrhizal fungi in black oak, but not with arbuscular mycorrhizal or dark septate fungal colonization in sugar maple. Gray birch had no effect on maple seedling performance or soil chemistry, and a small effect on black oak performance in the absence of aboveground competition. We found little evidence consistent with elemental allelopathy. Black oak and sugar maple seedlings responded more strongly to variation in soil nutrients than soil heavy metals, and they maintained leaf metal concentration profiles markedly different from those in their soils. We conclude that gray birch alters its environment in ways that could promote establishment and succession of woody species, potentially favoring those that are ectomycorrhizal, but most effects of PSF are overpowered by aboveground competition, herbivory, and/or existing abiotic soil factors. This study well illustrates why the potential for PSF to affect plant performance and community structure must be examined within the context of other ecological processes. Such a broad understanding can inform decisions made in the remediation and management of disturbed sites, and our understanding of plant succession and coexistence in general. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2019 Dietterich, Li, Garvey and Casper.

AB  - We used natural and tracer nitrogen (N) isotopes in a Pinus taeda free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment to investigate functioning of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi in N cycling. Fungal sporocarps were sampled in 2004 (natural abundance and 15N tracer) and 2010 (tracer) and $\delta$15N patterns were compared against litter and soil pools. Ectomycorrhizal fungi with hydrophobic ectomycorrhizas (e.g. Cortinarius and Tricholoma) acquired N from the Oea horizon or deeper. Taxa with hydrophilic ectomycorrhizas acquired N from the Oi horizon (Russula and Lactarius) or deeper (Laccaria, Inocybe, and Amanita). 15N enrichment patterns for Cortinarius and Amanita in 2010 did not correspond to any measured bulk pool, suggesting that a persistent pool of active organic N supplied these two taxa. Saprotrophic fungi could be separated into those colonizing pine cones (Baeospora), wood, litter (Oi), and soil (Ramariopsis), with $\delta$15N of taxa reflecting substrate differences. 15N enrichment between sources and sporocarps varied across taxa and contributed to $\delta$15N patterns. Natural abundance and 15N tracers proved useful for tracking N from different depths into fungal taxa, generally corresponded to literature estimates of fungal activity within soil profiles, and provided new insights into interpreting natural abundance $\delta$15N patterns. {\textcopyright} 2013 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - The mycelia of saprotrophic (SP) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi occur throughout the upper soil horizons in coniferous forests and could therefore be exposed to high concentrations of monoterpenes occurring in the needle litter of some tree species. Monoterpenes are mycotoxic and could potentially affect fungi that are exposed to them in the litter layers. In order to investigate whether monoterpenes typical of coniferous litters could influence fungal communities, we analysed the monoterpene content of freshly fallen needles of Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Picea sitchensis. The most abundant monoterpenes were found to be $\alpha$-pinene, $\beta$-pinene and 3-carene. We evaluated the effects of these three monoterpene vapours on the biomass production of 23 SP isolates and 16 ECM isolates. Overall, 75% of ECM isolates and 26% of SP isolates were significantly inhibited by at least one of the monoterpene treatments and both intra- and inter-specific variations in response were observed. Monoterpene concentrations are highest in surface litters. The differential effects on fungal taxa may influence the spatial and temporal distribution of fungal community composition, indirectly affecting decomposition and nutrient cycling, the fundamental ecosystem processes in which fungi have a key role in coniferous forest soils. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background and aims: Mycorrhizosphere is the interface between roots and soil where a myriad of microorganisms mediate plant growth, nutrient acquisition and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, and result in driving ecosystem biogeochemical cycling. Understanding the complexity and dynamics of mycorrhizosphere and its ecology and evolution are critical to enhancing forest productivity and ecosystem functioning, especially in high latitude temperate or high altitude alpine forests. However, the fungal community compositions and their driving ecological mechanisms of mycorrhizosphere during forest restoration are poorly documented. Methods: In this study, we simultaneously examined the ectomycorrhizal (EM) and rhizospheric fungal communities of two dominant host tree species (Abies faxoniana and Betula albosinensis) in subalpine forest communities with distinct forest restoration stages (30- vs. 60-year) after clear-cutting. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences was adopted. Results: A total of 1222 EM and 5880 rhizosphere fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained at a 97% sequence similarity level, which were mainly dominated by Basidiomycota. Host identity and forest restoration stage had no significant effects on fungal species richness of both EM and rhizospheric fungi. However, the community assembly of EM and rhizospheric fungi was significantly different during forest restoration, with opposite patterns shown on ectomycorrhizae and rhizosphere. The EM fungal community assembly was significantly affected by host identity, stand age and population dynamic, while the rhizosphere fungal community was significantly structured by combinations of host trees biomass, soil properties and spatial distance. Conclusions: Our data provide important insights that community assembly of EM and rhizosphere fungi may respond idiosyncratically during forest restoration, which will help us deeper understanding forest succession, stability and ecosystem functioning on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - As the range of bark beetles expands into new forests and woodlands, the need to understand their effects on multiple trophic levels becomes increasingly important. To date, much attention has been paid to the aboveground processes affected by bark beetle infestation, with a focus on photoautotrophs and ecosystem level processes. However, indirect effects of bark beetle on belowground processes, especially the structure and function of soil microbiota remains largely a black box. Our study examined the impacts of bark beetle-induced tree mortality on soil microbial community structure and function using high-throughput sequencing of the soil bacterial and fungal communities and measurements of extracellular enzyme activities. The results suggest bark beetle infestation affected edaphic conditions through increased soil water content, pH, electrical conductivity, and carbon/nitrogen ratio and altered bulk and rhizosphere soil microbial community structure and function. Finally, increased enzymatic activity suggests heightened microbial decomposition following bark beetle infestation. With this increase in enzymatic activity, nutrients trapped in organic substrates may become accessible to seedlings and potentially alter the trajectory of forest regeneration. Our results indicate the need for incorporation of microbial processes into ecosystem level models. IMPORTANCE Belowground impacts of bark beetle infestation have not been explored as thoroughly as their aboveground counterparts. In order to accurately model impacts of bark beetle-induced tree mortality on carbon and nutrient cycling and forest regeneration, the intricacies of soil microbial communities must be examined. In this study, we investigated the structure and function of soil bacterial and fungal communities following bark beetle infestation. Our results show bark beetle infestation to impact soil conditions, as well as soil microbial community structure and function. {\textcopyright} 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Despite its importance to energy flow and nutrient cycling the process of fine root decomposition has received comparatively little detailed research. Disruption of the fine root-soil interface during preparation of root litterbags for decomposition studies could affect decay rates and nutrient mobilization in part by altering the community of decay organisms. We compared rates of decomposition and nutrient release from fine roots of pine between litterbags and intact cores and characterized the fungal community in the decomposing roots. Fine root decomposition was about twice as fast overall for intact cores than litterbags, and rapid mobilization of N and P was observed for roots in cores whereas nutrients were immobilized in litterbags. Fungal communities characterized using 454 pyrosequencing were considerably different between decaying roots in intact cores and litterbags. Most interesting, taxa from ectomycorrhizal fungal orders such as Boletales, Thelephorales and Cantharellales appeared to be more common in decaying roots from cores than litterbags. Moreover, the rate of N and P mobilization from decaying fine roots was highly correlated with taxa from two orders of ectomycorrhizal fungi (Thelephorales, Cantharellales). Although we caution that DNA identified from the decaying roots cannot be conclusively ascribed to active fungi, the results provide tentative support for a significant role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in decomposition and nutrient mobilization from fine roots of pine.

AB  - Mycological and floristic research was carried out in alluvial forests (alliances Alnion incanae Paw{\l}owski in Paw{\l}owski et al. 1928 and Salicion albae So{\'{o}} 1930) in the alluvium of the Mur{\'{a}}nka river in the north-western part of the Gemer region in central Slovakia during 2009–2012. In the studied forest stands the authors identified altogether 236 macromycetes and 13 slime molds (in total 249 taxa). As the first records for Slovakia following specimens were found out: Diderma globosum var. europaeum, Fuligo laeviderma (Myxomycota), Entomophthora coleopterorum (Zygomycota), Acrospermum compressum, Belonopsis filispora, Echnoa infernalis, Xylaria digitata (Ascomycota) and Hohenbuehelia angustata, Melampsora amygdalinae (Basidiomycota). The highest number of taxa belong among lignicolous saprotrophes (158 species) and terrestric saprotrophes (51 species), this might be because of enough dead wood substrate and rich humus litter layer on alluvial soils in the habitats. On the other hand, the number of lignicolous parasites (13 taxa) and ectomycorrhizal symbionts (11 taxa) were rather low.

AB  - Forest ecosystem disturbances generate changes including soil changes, generally with loss of topsoil and loss of much of the diversity of microorganisms, which are usually replaced by others that are more adapted to the new conditions. We describe the effect of rainforest clear-cutting in Madagascar, with stripping of surface soil horizons among ectomycorrhizal fungal communities associated with natural Asteropeia mcphersonii seedlings. An experimental device was placed on four sites, each including an undisturbed plot with litter and a plot in clear-cut areas on a soil composed of a homogeneous mineral substrate. On each of these eight plots the ectomycorrhizal infection rate was determined and root tips were collected to sequence the internal transcribed spacer. 219 sequences grouped into 59 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained. The main taxonomic groups were Russulaceae, Boletales and Thelephoraceae. Marked spatial aggregation was observed for OTUs. The disturbance significantly affected the ectomycorrhizal infection rate of A. mcphersonii seedlings and the OTU composition of mycorrhizal communities. However, some OTUs were found in both types of environments. We discuss the effect of the disturbance on mycorrhizal communities associated with natural ectomycorrhizal A. mcphersonii seedlings, particularly in view of its application to ecological restoration of disturbed forest environments. {\textcopyright} 2016 Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} botanique de France.

AB  - Three major morphological types of ectomycorrhizae have been distinguished on roots of Eucalyptus marginara (jarrah). These were broadly classified as white, brown and black types. The variation in type of ectornycorrhizae and number of infected tips with season and depth in the soil were monitored at three forest sites. The sites had been burnt 1, 6 and 45 years before sampling. Formation of ectomycorrhizae occurred in winter and spring. The black type was found predominantly in the soil whilst the white and brown types were associated with litter. The mean number of ectomycorrhizal root tips was highest in the 45 year unburnt and least in the 1 year unburnt site, suggesting that burning history influences their abundance. {\textcopyright} 1981 CSIRO.

AB  - Twenty-three orchid species were recorded in Alcoa's permanent vegetation-monitoring plots in unmined and rehabilitated jarrah forest. Of these, 22 were identified in the unmined jarrah forest and 20 were recorded in rehabilitated areas of between 1 and 31 years old. Three species (Cyrtostylis ovata, Lyperanthus serratus and Prasophyllum elatum) were only recorded in the unmined forest and one species was only recorded in ;rehabilitated areas (Diuris carinata). The overall density of native orchids in the forest was 13 755 plants ha(-1), 10 times greater than the density in rehabilitated areas (1381 plants ha(-1)). The most abundant species in the forest were Cyrtostylis robusta, Caladenia flava, Pterostylis nana and Thelymitra crinita, all with densities greater than 1000 plants ha(-1). The most abundant species in the rehabilitated areas were Microtis media, Disa bracteata ( an introduced species), Caladenia flava, Pterostylis nana, Diuris longifolia and Pterostylis vittata, all with densities greater than 60 plants ha(-1). In rehabilitation older than 10 years, the density of orchids increased to 2685 plants ha(-1). Burning in rehabilitated areas resulted in large increases in orchid densities. It is believed that orchid colonisation of rehabilitated bauxite mines is dependent on symbiotic mycorrhiza, which are in turn dependent on development of an organic litter component in the soil.

AB  - Brown rot decay removes cellulose and hemicellulose from wood - residual lignin contributing up to 30% of forest soil carbon - and is derived from an ancestral white rot saprotrophy in which both lignin and cellulose are decomposed. Comparative and functional genomics of the "dry rot" fungus Serpula lacrymans, derived from forest ancestors, demonstrated that the evolution of both ectomycorrhizal biotrophy and brown rot saprotrophy were accompanied by reductions and losses in specific protein families, suggesting adaptation to an intercellular interaction with plant tissue. Transcriptome and proteome analysis also identified differences in wood decomposition in S. lacrymans relative to the brown rot Postia placenta. Furthermore, fungal nutritional mode diversification suggests that the boreal forest biome originated via genetic coevolution of above- and below-ground biota.

AB  - Fine roots and mycorrhizal fungi may either stimulate leaf litter decomposition by providing free-living decomposers with root-derived carbon, or may slow decomposition through nutrient competition between mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi. We reduced the presence of fine roots and their associated mycorrhizal fungi in a northern hardwood forest in New Hampshire, USA by soil trenching. Plots spanned a mycorrhizal gradient from 96\% arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations to 100\% ectomycorrhizal (ECM)-associated tree basal area. We incubated four species of leaf litter within these plots in areas with reduced access to roots and mycorrhizal fungi and in adjacent areas with intact roots and mycorrhizal fungi. Over a period of 608 d, we found that litter decayed more rapidly in the presence of fine roots and mycorrhizal hyphae regardless of the dominant tree mycorrhizal association. Root and mycorrhizal exclusion reduced the activity of acid phosphatase on decomposing litter. Our results indicate that both AM- and ECM-associated fine roots stimulate litter decomposition in this system. These findings suggest that the effect of fine roots and mycorrhizal fungi on litter decay in a particular ecosystem likely depends on whether interactions between mycorrhizal roots and saprotrophic fungi are antagonistic or facilitative. ????

AB  - The widespread occurrence of mycorrhizae in nature and their importance in the mineral nutrition of almost all plants has been extensively documented but despite this mycorrhizae have not been included in nutrient cycling studies of forest ecosystems. This neglect may be due to a failure on the part of researchers to recognize the functional differences between mycorrhizae and roots and to the labour‐intensive effort needed to study mycorrhizae. Biomass or surface area of mycorrhizae must be measured before information on ion absorption by mycorrhizae can be applied to forest ecosystems. A full assessment of the importance of mycorrhizae in nutrient cycling also requires data on mycorrhiza production, senescence, and decomposition. Few mycorrhiza studies have provided such data. Consequently, our information on nutrient cycling is derived from fine root (≥ 5 mm in diameter) data which may or may not include mycorrhizae. Recent studies have shown that most of the organic input to the decomposition process results from fine root production. Fine root mortality and decomposition is also more important than other mechanisms for returning nitrogen immobilized in vegetation to the soil in both deciduous and coniferous forests. A recently completed study indicates that mycorrhizae account for 50% of the annual throughput of biomass and for 43% of the nitrogen released annually in a Douglas fir ecosystem. These transfers are five times larger than the releases from litterfall or litter decomposition. Clearly, the study of mycorrhizal nutrient cycling is in an embryonic state and considerable additional research is needed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1980, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Climate warming is shifting the elevational boundary between forests and tundra upwards, but the related belowground responses are poorly understood. In the pristine South and Polar Urals with shifts of the treeline ecotone documented by historical photographs, we investigated fine root dynamics and production of extramatrical mycorrhizal mycelia (EMM) along four elevational transects reaching from the closed forest to the treeless tundra. In addition, we analysed elevational differences in climate and vegetation structure, and excavated trees to estimate related changes in the partitioning between below- and aboveground biomass. Fine root biomass of trees (<2 mm) increased by 13–79% with elevation, paralleled by a 35–72% increase in ground vegetation fine roots from the closed forest to the tundra. During the first year of decomposition, mass loss of fine root litter from different vegetation types was greater at lower elevations in the forest–tundra ecotone. The ratio between fine roots of trees and stem biomass largely increased with elevation in both regions, but these increases were not accompanied by a distinct production of EMM. Production of EMM, however, increased with the presence of ectomycorrhizal trees at the transition from the tundra to the forest. Our results imply that the recorded upward expansion of forest into former tundra in the Ural Mountains by 4–8 m per decade is decreasing the partitioning of plant biomass to fine roots. They further suggest that climate-driven forest advances will alter EMM production rates with potential feedbacks on soil carbon and nutrient cycling in these ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The integration of a comprehensive monitoring programme conducted in a temperate woodland through statistical analysis and simulation modelling is presented here. The Heron Wood Reserve in Peebleshire, Scotland is a 7.5-ha wood, left untended to facilitate investigation into a natural Scottish Woodland Ecosystem. Data on fungal fruiting have been collected since 1994, and since November 2000 physico-chemical and biotic experiments on soil and woodland litter have also been conducted with the aim to construct and integrate a number of simulation submodels of the various ecological systems present in an untended Scottish woodland. Important systems for modelling include patterns of fungal succession, habitat characteristics and fungal biochemical patterns. A large volume of data has been collected so computer software is used for the storage and handling of data. Microsoft Access was the database used for storage; integration of functions available in Microsoft Excel with a customised software written in Microsoft Visual Basic and Microsoft VBA allowed various statistical modelling tests (e.g. Scheff{\'{e}} analysis of contrast) to be carried out, and the quick display of data in a suitable manner. Model Maker software is used to construct and test simulation models formulated from the data and ultimately to facilitate the running of various simulations. Integration of the separate lines of investigation is demonstrated on the example of a case study describing differences in the dynamics of decomposers in beech- and birch-dominated habitats. Integration of the information obtained allowed us to put forward the following hypothesis. The leaf litter produced by beech trees is of lower quality compared to birch, and decomposition in beech-dominated habitats is delayed (i.e. in comparison to birch-dominated) because of the differences in the extent to which these plants create and maintain a litter and humus layer (sensu Wardle, Communities and Ecosystems. Linking the Aboveground and Belowground Components, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2002). Hence, the decomposition in beech-dominated habitats mainly occurs somewhat deeper in the soil profile, and may be carried out with some considerable involvement of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The correct understanding of the site-specific peculiarities of the ecological patterns is important for the improvement of biodiversity of woodland and forest ecosystems both in Scotland and worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background and aims: Decomposition and transformation of organic matter (OM) in forest soils are conducted by the concomitant action of saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi. Here, we examine chemical changes in OM after fungal colonization in nitrogen fertilized and unfertilized soils from a Norway spruce forest. Methods: Sand-filled bags amended with composted maize leaves were placed in the forest soil and harvested after 17 months. Infrared and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopies were used to study the chemical changes in the OM. Fungal community composition of the bags was also evaluated. Results: The proportion of ectomycorrhizal fungi declined in the fertilized plots, but the overall fungal community composition was similar between N treatments. Decomposition of the OM was, independently of the N level or soil horizon, accompanied by an increase of C/N ratio of the mesh-bag content. Moreover, the proportions of carboxylic compounds in the incubated OM increased in the mineral horizon, while heterocyclic-N compounds decreased, especially in unfertilized plots with higher N demand from the trees. Conclusions: Our results indicate that more oxidized organic C and less heterocyclic-N proportions in the OM remain after fungal colonization in the mineral layers, and suggest that ectomycorrhizal fungi transfer less heterocyclic-N from the mesh bags to the host trees under high N levels. {\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Microbial communities in litter and soil are the functional link through which the tree species occupying a site may alter rates of soil processes fundamental to nutrient cycling and carbon flux. Through differences in the nature of their litter, their mycorrhizal fungal associates and the exudates they release into the rhizo/mycorrhizosphere, different tree species may give rise to distinct microbial communities in litter and soil. We examine the evidence that tree species influence the composition of the microbial communities in decomposing litter, forest floors, soil and the rhizo/mycorrhizosphere. The microbial communities considered in this review include bacteria, archaea, fungi and both free-living and symbiotic organisms. There is evidence that distinct microbial communities develop on decomposing leaf litters of different tree species, however, given the well-documented succession of microbes on decomposing litter, comparisons amongst tree species of microbial communities in litters and forest floors at the same stage of decay are needed to definitively deduce the influence of tree species. Distinct microbial communities have been reported in forest floors under different tree species; differences are most pronounced in the F layer. Distinctions in microbial communities in mineral soil under different tree species have been determined in several common garden experiments. The main factors associated with differences in microbial communities in litter, forest floors and soil are the pH and base cation content of the litter and whether the trees are broadleaf or coniferous. Identified differences in microbial communities in the rhizospheres of different tree species are more likely to be differences in the mycorrhizospheres and hyphospheres, given the predominance of associations with mycorrhizal fungi. Distinct microbial communities have been identified in the mycorrhizosphere under different tree species; these are influenced both by the tree species and by the mycorrhizal fungi with which the tree associates. Heightened attention during sampling to ensure comparison of `like with like' could improve our ability to distinguish influence of tree species in decomposing litter, forest floors and soil. A significant remaining challenge is characterizing exudates from different tree-mycorrhizal fungi associations and understanding interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and microbial communities in the hyphosphere. A complete tapestry of the linkages between tree species and soil microbial communities requires that we also weave in the effects of soil fauna. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In nitrogen (N)-limited boreal forests, trees depend on the decomposing activity of their ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal symbionts to access soil N. A large fraction of this N exists as proteinaceous compounds associated with mineral particles. However, it is not known if ECM fungi can access these mineral-associated proteins; accordingly, possible acquisition mechanisms have not been investigated. With tightly controlled isotopic, spectroscopic, and chromatographic experiments, we quantified and analyzed the mechanisms of N acquisition from iron oxide mineral-associated proteins by Paxillus involutus, a widespread ECM fungus in boreal forests. The fungus acquired N from the mineral-associated proteins. The collective results indicated a proteolytic mechanism involving formation of the crucial enzyme–substrate complexes at the mineral surfaces. Hence, the enzymes hydrolyzed the mineral-associated proteins without initial desorption of the proteins. The proteolytic activity was suppressed by adsorption of proteases to the mineral particles. This process was counteracted by fungal secretion of mineral-surface-reactive compounds that decreased the protease–mineral interactions and thereby promoted the formation of enzyme–substrate complexes. The ability of ECM fungi to simultaneously generate extracellular proteases and surface-reactive metabolites suggests that they can play an important role in unlocking the large N pool of mineral-associated proteins to trees in boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Gastrodia flabilabella is a mycoheterotrophic orchid that obtains carbohydrates and nutrients from its symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi. The species is an endemic and vulnerable species enlisted in the “A Preliminary Red List of Taiwanese Vascular Plants” according to the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria Version 3.1. G. flabilabella dwells the underground of broadleaf and coniferous forest with richness litter. Based on herbarium records, this species is distributed in central Taiwan. Twenty eight microsatellite loci were developed in G. flabilabella and were tested for cross-species amplification in additional taxa of G. confusoides, G. elata, and G. javanica. We estimated the genetic variation that is valuable for conservation management and the development of the molecular identification system for G. elata, a traditional Chinese medicine herb. Results: Microsatellite primer sets were developed from G. flabilabella using the modified AFLP and magnetic bead enrichment method. In total, 257 microsatellite loci were obtained from a magnetic bead enrichment SSR library. Of the 28 microsatellite loci, 16 were polymorphic, in which the number of alleles ranged from 2 to 15, with the observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.02 to 1.00. In total, 15, 13, and 7 of the loci were found to be interspecifically amplifiable to G. confusoides, G. elata, and G. javanica, respectively. Conclusions: Amplifiable and transferable microsatellite loci are potentially useful for future studies in investigating intraspecific genetic variation, reconstructing phylogeographic patterns among closely related species, and establishing the standard operating system of molecular identification in Gastrodia. {\textcopyright} 2014 Tsai et al.

AB  - Wildfires are a pervasive disturbance in boreal forests, and the frequency and intensity of boreal wildfires is expected to increase with climate warming. Boreal forests store a large fraction of global soil organic carbon (C), but relatively few studies have documented how wildfires affect soil microbial communities and soil C dynamics. We used a fire chronosequence in upland boreal forests of interior Alaska with sites that were 1, 7, 12, 24, 55, $\sim$90, and $\sim$100 years post-fire to examine the short- and long-term responses of fungal community composition, fungal abundance, extracellular enzyme activity, and litter decomposition to wildfires. We hypothesized that post-fire changes in fungal abundance and community composition would constrain decomposition following fires. We found that wildfires altered the composition of soil fungal communities. The relative abundance of ascomycetes significantly increased following fire whereas basidiomycetes decreased. Post-fire decreases in basidiomycete fungi were likely attributable to declines in ectomycorrhizal fungi. Fungal hyphal lengths in the organic horizon significantly declined in response to wildfire, and they required at least 24 years to return to pre-fire levels. Post-fire reductions in fungal hyphal length were associated with decreased activities of hydrolytic extracellular enzymes. In support of our hypothesis, the decomposition rate of aspen and black spruce litter significantly increased as forests recovered from fire. Our results indicate that post-fire reductions in soil fungal abundance and activity likely inhibit litter decomposition following boreal wildfires. Slower rates of litter decay may lead to decreased heterotrophic respiration from soil following fires and contribute to a negative feedback to climate warming. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) availability influences the productivity and distribution of plants in tropical montane forests. Strategies to acquire soil N, such as direct uptake of organic compounds or associations with root symbionts to enhance N acquisition in exchange for carbon (C), may facilitate plant species coexistence and ecosystem N retention. Alternatively, rapid microbial turnover of soil N forms in tropical soils might promote flexible plant N-uptake strategies and mediate species coexistence. We tested whether sympatric plant species with different root symbiont associations, and therefore potentially different nutrient acquisition strategies, partition chemical forms of N or show plasticity in N uptake in a tropical pre-montane forest in Panama. We traced the movement of three 15N forms into soil pools, microbes, and seedlings of eleven species differing in root traits. Seedlings were grown in a split-plot field transplant experiment, with plots receiving equimolar mixtures of ammonium, nitrate, and glycine, with one form isotopically labeled in each block. After 48 h, more 15N was recovered in microbes than in plants, while all pools (extractable organic and inorganic N, microbial biomass, and leaves) contained greater amounts of 15N from nitrate than from ammonium or glycine. Furthermore, 13C from dual-labeled glycine was not recovered in the leaves of any seedling, suggesting the studied species do not directly take up organic N or transform organic N prior to translocation to leaves. Nitrogen uptake differed by root symbiont group only for nitrate, with greater 15N recovery in plants with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations or proteoid roots compared to orchids. Some root trait groups differed in 15N recovery among N forms, with greater nitrate uptake than ammonium or glycine by AM-associated and N2-fixing plants. However, only five of eleven species showed differences in uptake among N forms. These results indicate flexibility in uptake of N forms in tropical plants across root trait groups, with only a few species displaying weak preferences for a specific N form. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - The abundance of fine roots and leaves in forests typically peaks during mid-succession and then declines. If fine root area declines more rapidly than leaf area, this could contribute disproportionately to stand decline. However, trees also partner with symbiotic ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi that facilitate nutrient acquisition of fine roots. Ectomycorrhizal fungi can use the carbohydrates provided by their plant partners to produce emanating fungal tissues which increase soil exploration potential but may also prove costly. We suggest two competing hypotheses to frame the response of ectomycorrhizas to stand age: (a) the ‘functional offset' hypothesis posits that the abundance of ectomycorrhizas with emanating tissues (‘Distance' mycorrhizas) increases with stand age and (b) the ‘energy-limited' hypothesis posits that carbon available for root symbionts decreases with stand age resulting in fewer Distance mycorrhizas. In the first hypothesis, EcM functional traits offset root abundance, while in the second, traits parallel root abundance. To test these competing hypotheses, we sampled fine roots to a depth of 90 cm and used allometric equations to estimate changes in root and leaf area index across a chronosequence of Pinus banksiana stands ranging from 2 to 76 years average tree age. We also examined fine roots microscopically to track changes in the abundance of EcM functional types. We used DNA-based methods to sequence EcM fungi and confirm roots were of P. banksiana. Both fine root and leaf area of pine increased for the first 30–36 years (until Mid age) and then plateaued, while the ratio of leaf to fine root area was similar across the age gradient. Also, changes to fine root area with stand age depended on soil depth. The abundance of Distance mycorrhizas was lowest at the youngest plots and increased until Mid age, where it peaked, contrary to the functional offset hypothesis. Instead, the abundance of Distance mycorrhizas paralleled changes to leaf area, aligned with the energy-limited hypothesis. Synthesis. Ectomycorrhizas do not offset the function of roots, rather shifts in exploration type likely reflect adjustments to carbon supply from hosts. {\textcopyright} 2020 British Ecological Society

AB  - Microbiological features and in situ microbial activities were analyzed in soils at a black alder forest adjacent to the eutrophic Lake Belau during the course of the interdisciplinary program, {\textordfeminine} Ecosystem Research in the Bornho{\`{E}} ved Lake District.{\textordmasculine} Themicrobiological data were combined to evaluate the functional status of the Histosols. It was hypothesized that carbon accumulation typical for Histosols would mainly take place at the wet part ({\textordfeminine} wet site{\textordmasculine}) close to the lake shore and not at the drier part ({\textordfeminine} dry site{\textordmasculine}) of the forest. Rates of leaf litter decomposition, in situ soil C mineralization, and in situ N2 -fixation were higher at the wet site. Furthermore, the composition of the bacterial communities and the presence of ectomycorrhizas indicated sufficient O2 availability and high microbial vitality in the soil at the wet site. An anthropogenic lowering of the lake water table during the 1930s seems still to control the actual soil conditions, resulting in humus degradation in the two Histosols of the forest. The two soils clearly differed in productivity and C and N cycling, being controlled either by upland, acid runoff or by eutrophic lake water. Lake water seems to buffer but also to intensify microbial transformations at the wet site and to supply nutrients, although humus decay may possibly be decelerated by a temporarily high water table and refractory humic substances. {\textcopyright} 1997 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Plant productivity and ecosystem productivity are strongly influenced by nutrient availability, Which is largely determined by the decomposition rate of plant litter. Belowground litter inputs (dead roots, mycorrhizae, and exudates) are larger than aboveground litterfall in many systems. Chemical quality and diameter primarily control decomposition for coarse roots, but these patterns do not hold for finer classes of roots, which are frequently colonized by mycorrhizae. Though mycorrhizal status is known to drastically alter toot chemistry, morphology, life span, and exudation, it has never been explicitly, considered as a factor affecting root decomposition. We hypothesize that mycorrhizal status substantially influences fine root decomposition rates. Both ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can change root properties but do,so in different ways. Dominant tree species of most cold and temperate forests rely heavily on EM associations. EM fungi form massive structures that envelop fine roots. Roots infected by ectomycorrhizae have higher nitrogen concentrations than nonmycorrhizal roots, which would be expected to increase decomposition rates, but much of this nitrogen is bound in recalcitrant forms, such as chitin, so the net effect on decomposition is difficult to predict. AM fungi lack elaborate, macroscopic structures and may not alter root chemistry as profoundly. In addition to mycorrhizal roots, external fungal hyphae can contribute significantly to ecosystem carbon budgets and thereby influence rates of soil carbon turnover. Hyphae have commonly been considered a rapidly decomposing carbon pool, though this has never been demonstrated experimentally. If hyphae are produced at the expense of rapidly decomposing root exudates, then the net effect of hyphal litter production might be to reduce soil microbial activity and overall carbon cycling rates. Based on known differences in morphology and chemistry, EM hyphae may be more recalcitrant than AM hyphae. In summary, we submit that mycorrhizal status could substantially influence fine root decomposition and soil carbon processing rates, potentially explaining some of the variation observed within and among individual plant species and ecosystems.

AB  - Forest provides the most significant ecosystem services among the terrestrial ecosystems, and plays an important role in sequestering carbon (C) and mitigating the ongoing global climate change. Dissolved carbon (DC) and particulate carbon (PC) fluxes are important components in forest C budgets. Quantifying fluxes of DC and PC in forest ecosystems is essential to better understanding the C cycling processes and improving the assessment and prediction of C sequestration capacity in the ecosystems. However, the budgets of DC and PC have often been ignored in forest C cycling studies largely due to knowledge shortage and difficulty in taking measurements. Here, we reviewed the recent progress in DC and PC studies in forest ecosystems. We discussed the composition and function of DC and PC, associated ecological processes and influencing factors, and finally pointed out future research priorities in this field. The DC and PC in a forest ecosystem mainly consist of dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved inorganic C (DIC), particulate organic C (POC), black C and carbonate C, which fundamentally originate from net primary production of the ecosystem. DOC, an important active pool of C and nutrients, is mainly composed of carbohydrates, long-chain aliphatic compounds, aromatic compounds, proteins, and low molecular weight organic acids. The DOC content is correlated positively with concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates, but negatively with concentrations of carboxyl C. The DOC in soil solution is mainly derived from plant litter, soil humus, microbial debris, root exudates, and ectomycorrhizal mycelium. DIC consists of dissolved inorganic carbonate, dissolved bicarbonate, dissolved carbonate and dissolved carbon dioxide. It activates soil nutrient elements and thus enhances plant growth. POC is the major form of PC in forest soils that includes polymeric gel, organic fiber, cell fragments, microbial biomass (such as algae and bacteria), and polymerized DOC. Both DC and PC are labile C pools in the forest soil system, which enter the ecosystem from atmospheric deposition, throughfall and litterfall, and leave the ecosystem via soil respiration, lateral transport and seepage. At a small local scale, fluxes of DC and PC are mainly influenced by such biotic factors as root exudates, fine root decomposition and microbial turnover. At a large regional scale, they are jointly affected by soil and vegetation characteristics, coupling effects of ecological processes, climatic conditions and global changes. Future research priorities in this field should be: (1) to explore the factors controlling fluxes of DC and PC in forest ecosystems on various spatio-temporal scales, their potential coupling relationships and underlying mechanisms; (2) to understand interactions and transformation between DC/PC and other C fluxes in forest ecosystems, and explore potential stoichiometric relationships between DC/PC and other nutrients in the systems and (3) to explore effects of global changes on fluxes of DC and PC in forest ecosystems, particularly focusing on the effects of extreme disturbances, such as forest management, wildfire, drought, flooding, ice and frozen, and freeze-thaw cycles. {\textcopyright} 2014, Science Press.

AB  - To examine the effect of the spatial distribution of litter and intergeneric interaction on the spatial distribution of agaric fruiting bodies, we surveyed spatial distribution of fruiting bodies of Agaricales in a mixed forest dominated by Pinus densiflora (Sieb et Zucc.) from July 1999 to July 2002. Three 10 x 10-m plots with different vegetation and positions on a slope were established: Top-Mixed, Top-Pinus, and Bottom-Pinus. Litter thickness in the Top-Mixed plot was the thinnest among the three plots. During the study, we counted 3563 fruiting bodies in 27 genera from 13 families. The dominant genera were Collybia, Marasmius, Mycena, Rhodophyllus, and Lactarius, and showed an intrageneric aggregated distribution at a quadrat size of 1 m2. Collybia and Lactarius formed fruiting bodies in arcs. The spatial distribution of Collybia, Marasmius, and Lactarius fruiting bodies tended to overlap in two consecutive years. In the Top-Mixed plot, the number of Marasmius fruiting bodies increased with increasing litter thickness, while that of Lactarius decreased with litter thickness. Values of C′ $\delta$ indicating degree of overlap were calculated for particular pairs of dominant fungal genera and the values differed between plots and years: for example, fruiting bodies of Marasmius and Mycena in the Bottom-Pinus plot were distributed aggregately in 1999 and 2000, but randomly in 2001, while they were distributed segregatedly in the Top-Pinus plot every year. Our study suggests that the spatial distribution of fungal fruiting bodies is affected by the distribution of litter in and between plots and that fungal flora is affected by vegetation. {\textcopyright} The Japanese Forest Society and Springer-Verlag 2006.

AB  - Microbial residue retention is critical for soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation in forests. However, the changes in soil microbial residues under atmospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition in tropical forests remain unclear. Here, we measured soil phospholipid fatty acids, enzyme activity, and amino sugars (biomarkers of microbial residues) in a seven-year N and P addition experiment in a secondary tropical montane rainforest. Our results showed that five years of nutrient additions showed no significant effect on microbial community structure but the effect became significant at the seventh year. In N addition plots, a decrease in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal biomass resulted in declines in the contribution of fungal residues to SOC and the ratio of fungal to bacterial residues. The fungi:bacteria ratio increased in P and N\&P addition plots while the fungal residue:bacterial residue ratio was decreased by P addition, which may be related to an imbalance in microbial residue decomposition. Both extracellular enzyme activities and SOC showed minor changes under nutrient additions. Our results suggest that changes in microbial community structure and enzyme activity induced by N and P deposition may alter the accumulation and composition of microbial residues in SOC in N-rich tropical forests.

AB  - To promote the formation of Shiros (fungal colonies) of T. matsutake, a thinning of the understory vegetation and a ploughing of the litter layer were conducted in the stand of 25-year-old Pinus densiflora SIEB. et ZUCC., the host plant of T. matsutake. Changes of environmental factors, especially of vegetation, soil, and fungal flora, were recorded for the 10 years following the treatment. The number of Shiro of T. matsutake and its fruit body production, began to increase 7 years after the thinning. The number of Shiro increased to about 2.4 times of that on the untreated plot. Ploughing of the litter layer was ineffective in propagating Shiro. By thinning the shrubs, the forest floor became dry and light, and litter accumulation decreased. The rate of formation of the A0 layer slowed, and the fine roots of P. densiflora, increased in the mineral soil horizon. Moreover, several species of other mycorrhizal fungi and some saprophytes, which were the competitors of T. matsutake, decreased remarkably in the treated plot. The Shiro of T. matsutake can be established in young. {\textcopyright} 1979, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY. All rights reserved.

AB  - While it has long been held that invasive plants alter ecosystem processes, the magnitude and direction of these effects have rarely been quantified in situ. We measured the effects of an invasive C4 grass (Microstegium vimineum) on soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition in a deciduous forest in south-central Indiana, USA. The unique 13C signature of the C4 grass relative to the C3 trees allowed us to partition soil CO2 fluxes and estimate M. vimineum effects on decomposition. The magnitude and direction of priming effects hinged on the soil characteristics, which related to the mycorrhizal association of dominant trees. In forest plots dominated by ectomycorrhizal trees, with low nitrogen availability and most SOM in particulate (i.e., unprotected) forms, M. vimineum increased SOM decomposition by 58%. In contrast, in plots dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal trees, characterized by high nitrogen availability and most SOM in mineral-associated (i.e., protected) forms, M. vimineum decreased decomposition by 14%. Collectively, our results demonstrate that invasive species can play a large role in altering ecosystem processes and suggest that the magnitude and direction of such effects depend on the dominant trees and edaphic characteristics of the stand. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ephemeral roots have essential roles in plant and ecosystem functioning. In forests, roots account for a major component of carbon cycling, yet few studies have examined ranges of root trait variation and how different species vary in root form and function in these communities. • Root branching intensity, specific root length (SRL; root length per unit dry mass), root diameter, tissue density, phenolic concentration and nitrogen concentration were determined for the finest two root orders of 25 co-existing North American woody species sampled from mature plants in a single forest community. Trait correlations and multivariate patterns were examined to evaluate the most important trait differences among species. • Branching intensity, SRL, and phenolic concentration varied most widely among species (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.42, 0.57 and 0.58, respectively). Species predominately forming ectomycorrhiza (EM) had a higher branching intensity than those forming arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) with mycorrhizal types correctly predicted in c. 70% of individual observations by branching intensity alone. There was notably no correlation between SRL and nitrogen. Variation in SRL among species mapped partially along phylogenetic lines (consistency index (CI) = 0.44), with remaining variation attributable to differences in species' ecological specialization. • Variation found in root traits suggests different nutrient acquisition strategies within this community, which could have potential species-level effects on carbon and mineral nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2009 New Phytologist.

AB  - \textcopyright} 2018, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved. Chemical changes in leaf input to forest soils have been reported to affect decay processes. In this work, litter mass loss and decomposition constants (k) during 200 days in solid-state fermentation of the native tree Celtis tala Gill. ex Planch. and the exotic one Ligustrum lucidum Ait. with three common litter saprotrophic basidiomycetes were compared. Alterations in litter quality were characterized by solid-state 13 C NMR spectroscopy, pH, soluble sugars, ammonium, proteins, and phenol content determination and were associated with extracellular lignocellulolytic enzyme production. Differences in substrate decomposition related to litter type were observed for Leratiomyces ceres, achieving a higher k in the exotic L. lucidum litter, which might be attributed to the induction of manganese peroxidase activity. Substrate preference for alkyl C and more degradation of lignified compounds were found in such substrates. Although no statistical differences in mass loss were observed for the rest of the fungi assayed, we detected changes in several of the parameters evaluated. This suggests that exotic invasions may alter ecosystem functioning by accelerating decomposition processes through an increased fungal ligninolytic activity.

AB  - Fire at the dry southern margin of the Amazon rainforest could have major consequences for regional soil carbon (C) storage and ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, but relatively little information exists about impacts of fire on soil C cycling within this sensitive ecotone. We measured CO2 effluxes from different soil components (ground surface litter, roots, mycorrhizae, soil organic matter) at a large-scale burn experiment designed to simulate a severe but realistic potential future scenario for the region (Fire plot) in Mato Grosso, Brazil, over 1 year, and compared these measurements to replicated data from a nearby, unmodified Control plot. After four burns over 5 years, soil CO2 efflux (Rs) was $\sim$5.5 t C ha−1 year−1 lower on the Fire plot compared to the Control. Most of the Fire plot Rs reduction was specifically due to lower ground surface litter and root respiration. Mycorrhizal respiration on both plots was around $\sim$20% of Rs. Soil surface temperature appeared to be more important than moisture as a driver of seasonal patterns in Rs at the site. Regular fire events decreased the seasonality of Rs at the study site, due to apparent differences in environmental sensitivities among biotic and abiotic soil components. These findings may contribute toward improved predictions of the amount and temporal pattern of C emissions across the large areas of tropical forest facing increasing fire disturbances associated with climate change and human activities. {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Data on the diversity and distribution of enzyme activities in native ectomycorrhizal (ECM) communities are inadequate. A microplate multiple enzymatic test was developed which makes it possible to measure eight enzyme activities on 14 individual, excised ECM root tips. Hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes are involved in the decomposition of lignocellulose, chitin and phosphorus-containing organic compounds. This test system was used to describe the functional diversity of ECM communities in two forest sites. This set of tests proved to be accurate and sensitive enough to reveal a high diversity of activity profiles, depending on the fungal symbiont and the soil horizon. Ectomycorrhizas can be classified into specialists and generalists, and appear to complement each other in the same horizon to collectively perform all eight activities studied. By including a higher number of different assays for more detailed analyses, ECM activity profiling will provide a valuable tool for studying the functional diversity of ECM communities. {\textcopyright} New Phytologist (2005).

AB  - In northern boreal forests ground level species occur which may have the capacity to suppress tree seedling regeneration substantially, particularly in late successional stages. We investigated, through an experiment involving sequential manipulations, the effects of three biotic components operating at the ground layer, i.e. above-ground effects of the ericaceous shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum and of the feather-moss species Pleurozium schreberi and the below-ground effects of extramatrical mycorrhizal hyphae, on the seedling establishment, growth and nutrient acquisition of Pinus sylvestris during two growing seasons. Germination and seedling establishment of P. sylvestris were enhanced by reduction of the above ground components of E. hermaphroditum and P. schreberi but were not influenced by temporary disruption of mycorrhizal hyphae. Seedling growth and nitrogen content were, however, signifi cantly increased when hyphal connections were disrupted and above ground influence of P. schreberi and E. hermaphroditum were reduced. Higher shoot:root ratios were also found in seedlings when hyphal connections were disrupted. Seedlings in treatments where P. schreberi was left intact and above ground interference by E. hermaphroditum was reduced had unusually low shoot:root ratios (1.6) after two growing seasons and significantly lower total amounts of nutrients after one growing season than were initially present in the seeds, indicative of a net nutrient drain during the early establishment phase. The experiment could not explain the mechanisms behind this unexpected nutrient drain. Possible rhizosphere interactions immobilizing nutrients and causing seedling nutrient losses are discussed. From the results of this study and other indirect evidence we hypothesize that the three biotic components we investigated could act together to immobilize nutrients and to inhibit tree seedling regeneration and growth in late successional stages of boreal forests.

AB  - Deadwood-associated insects and saprotrophic fungi are principal agents of wood decomposition in boreal forest. Silvicultural treatments that alter microclimate and availability of deadwood likely affect composition and growth rates of both insect and fungal communities, leading to changes in wood decomposition rates. Here, we relate both saproxylic beetle and dominant polypore assemblages with woody decomposition rates and environmental variables in experimental partial cuts, clearcuts, and uncut controls using a series of causal models to determine the relationship between stand structure, bio-diversity, and ecosystem function in black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) forests. Overall beetle and fungal composition differed between uncut stands and harvested stands. Main effects of harvesting included large increases in wood-feeding beetles and the fungus Gloeophyllum sepiarium (Wul.: Fr.) Karst. We suggest that these species were promoted by specific alterations in microhabitat conditions of deadwood. Within clearcuts specifically, changes in species composition and significantly more fungal degree-days resulted in significantly higher decomposition rates. We concluded that levels of partial cutting in the range of 15\%-20\% retention were not sufficient to maintain predisturbance communities but were sufficient to maintain wood decomposition rates similar to uncut stands.

AB  - The ecology of forest soils is an important field of research due to the role of forests as carbon sinks. Consequently, a significant amount of information has been accumulated concerning their ecology, especially for temperate and boreal forests. Although most studies have focused on fungi, forest soil bacteria also play important roles in this environment. In forest soils, bacteria inhabit multiple habitats with specific properties, including bulk soil, rhizosphere, litter, and deadwood habitats, where their communities are shaped by nutrient availability and biotic interactions. Bacteria contribute to a range of essential soil processes involved in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. They take part in the decomposition of dead plant biomass and are highly important for the decomposition of dead fungal mycelia. In rhizospheres of forest trees, bacteria interact with plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi as commensalists or mycorrhiza helpers. Bacteria also mediate multiple critical steps in the nitrogen cycle, including N fixation. Bacterial communities in forest soils respond to the effects of global change, such as climate warming, increased levels of carbon dioxide, or anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. This response, however, often reflects the specificities of each studied forest ecosystem, and it is still impossible to fully incorporate bacteria into predictive models. The understanding of bacterial ecology in forest soils has advanced dramatically in recent years, but it is still incomplete. The exact extent of the contribution of bacteria to forest ecosystem processes will be recognized only in the future, when the activities of all soil community members are studied simultaneously.

AB  - Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is frequently planted as a monoculture, but it is also grown in mixed plantations with other native trees such as pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Both pine and oak form ectomycorrhizas that cover their roots and extend into the soil, facilitating tree water and nutrient uptake in exchange for photosynthetic carbon. Forming the interface between the soil and tree roots, mycorrhizal fungi are key drivers of biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems and play an important role in the successful establishment of tree seedlings. They can, however, be susceptible to changes in the soil environment and in their hosts. Both environment and neighboring hosts affect how fungi colonize roots and may affect their host preference. Despite the importance of mycorrhizal fungi in forest ecosystems, little is known about the biodiversity and functional effects of mycorrhizal communities in mixed compared with monoculture plantations. Changes in mycorrhizal richness and composition can result in changes in functional groups with consequences for forest ecosystem stability and functioning. We compared pine mycorrhizas in eight mixed plantations of pine and oak and eight pine monocultures in two forests in England, and we investigated the main factors driving their taxonomic and functional composition. Geographical location and litter pH explained over 50% of the variation in pine mycorrhizal communities. Different environmental factors affected taxonomic and functional composition across stands, indicating functional redundancy. Pine tended to associate with more fungi in the presence of oak, but the abiotic environment exerted a stronger influence than oak presence on pine mycorrhizal diversity. {\textcopyright} 2017

AB  - Atmospheric N deposition has far-reaching impacts on forest ecosystems, including on-site impacts such as soil acidification, fertilization, and nutrient imbalances, and off-site environmental impacts such as nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emission. Although chronic N deposition has been believed to lead to forest N saturation, recent evidence suggests that N retention capacity, particularly in the forest floor, can be surprisingly high even under high N deposition. This review aims to provide an overview of N retention processes in the forest floor and the implications of changing C-N interactions for C sequestration. The fate of available N in forest soils has been explained by the competitive balance between tree roots, soil heterotrophs, and nitrifiers. However, high rates of N retention have been observed in numerous N addition experiments without noticeable increases in tree growth and soil respiration. Alternative hypotheses have been proposed to explain the gap between the input and loss of N in N-enriched, C-limited systems, including abiotic immobilization and mycorrhizal assimilation, both of which do not require additional C sources to incorporate N in soil N pools. Different fates of N in the forest floor have different implications for C sequestration. N-induced tree growth can enhance C accumulation in tree biomass as observed across temperate regions. C loss from forests can amount to or outweigh C gain in N-saturated, declining forests, while another type of 'C-N decoupling' can have positive or neutral effects on soil C sequestration through hampered organic matter decomposition or abiotic N immobilization, respectively.

AB  - Increasing environmental concerns with forestry have led to mounting interest in mixedwood management as a possible strategy to achieve a diversity of ecological and productivity goals within the context of sustainable forest management. This review focuses on the effects of mixedwoods on biodiversity including understory plants, birds, soil fauna, and ectomycorrhizae (ECM). It examines stand-level species diversity and composition but particularly focuses on the regional scale (gamma diversity) by examining evidence for the occurrence of mixedwood-indicator species. The main conclusions are as follows: (i) The existence of different tree species in the canopy is associated with provision of a greater diversity of microhabitats allowing for the addition of understory plant species associated with each canopy species. However, there is little evidence for the existence of understory plant species uniquely associated with mixedwoods. (ii) Some bird species require or prefer the presence of different tree species within a landscape or within a stand. Mixed forest stands and landscapes are thus critical to support populations of these species. (iii) A few studies showed a positive effect of mixed stands or mixed litters on some groups of soil organisms, but high variability makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about any potential benefits of mixedwoods for biodiversity of soil fauna. (iv) Some ECM taxa are associated with multiple hosts, and could thus benefit from availability of multiple possible host species found in mixed forest stands. Several studies confirmed that there was a greater abundance of multiple-host ECM taxa in mixedwoods.

AB  - Mycoheterotrophic plants depend entirely on fungal associations for organic nutrients. While most mycoheterotrophic plants are associated with the mycorrhizal partners of surrounding green plants, some mycoheterotrophs are believed to obtain carbon from decaying litter or dead wood by parasitising saprotrophic fungi, based on culture experiments and 13C and 15N isotopic signatures. The carbon age (the time since carbon was fixed from atmospheric CO2 by photosynthesis) can be estimated by measuring the concentration of 14C arising from the bomb tests of the 1950s and 1960s. Given that mycorrhizal fungi obtain photosynthate from their plant partners, and saprotrophic wood-decaying fungi obtain carbon from older sources, radiocarbon could represent a new and powerful tool to investigate carbon sources of mycoheterotrophic plants. We showed that the $\Delta$14C values of mycoheterotrophs exploiting ectomycorrhizal fungi were close to 0‰, similar to those of autotrophic plants. By contrast, the $\Delta$14C values of mycoheterotrophs exploiting saprotrophic fungi ranged from 110.7‰ to 324.8‰, due to the 14C-enriched bomb carbon from dead wood via saprotrophic fungi. Our study provides evidence supporting that some mycoheterotrophic orchids depend on forest woody debris. Our study also indicates that radiocarbon could be used to predict the trophic strategies of mycoheterotroph-associated fungal symbionts. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Macrofungi constitute a group of the high-value forest resources worldwide. In this paper, we report species richness and composition of the macrofungi in sal (Shorea robusta) forests of mid-hill central Nepal, which were managed for 4–29 years by the local communities. The sal forests were rich in macrofungi (115 species) with Polyporaceae being the largest family followed by Clavariaceae. Saprotrophic fungi were more common than mycorrhizal species. The proportion of mycorrhiza was <40% of the total macrofungi species which might have indicated the deteriorated condition of the forests before the initiation of conservation management. However, the proportion of mycorrhizal species was slightly higher in the forests managed for >10 years than in the forests managed for short period. The species richness increased with increasing canopy and litter cover. Since silvicultural activities and resource utilization often have negative impacts to macrofungal diversity, these activities need to be optimized to keep balance between forest management and biodiversity conservation. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Author(s).

AB  - Archaea are microorganisms belonging to the third domain of cellular life on earth. Despite being unicellular microorganisms, they differ from the bacteria in many ways, and actually share an evolutionary history with the Eukaryotic branch of life. Since their discovery in extreme habitats, they have during the last two decades been found to inhabit almost all environments on Earth. Specific linages of archaea have been found to live forest soil ecosystems, and they have been found to be especially associated with boreal forest tree roots and mycorrhizospheres. These archaea belong to the so called Group I.1c of uncultured Thaumarchaeota (formerly included in the Phylum Crenarchaeota), and euryarchaeotal linages phylogenetically falling with the generally extremely halophilic Halobacteriales, as well as with methylotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens belonging to the Methanolobus and Methanosaeta, respectively. Norway spruce is one of the most common forest trees in the Fennoscandian boreal forest. Only few studies have thus far been conducted on archaea inhabiting the rhizosphere and mycorrhizosphere of boreal forest trees, and even fewer have concentrated on Norway spruce. However, it has been shown that the tree species has profound effect on the community composition of the archaea in the rhizosphere. When the tree roots are colonized by ectomycorrhizal fungi, the effect of the fungus dominates and the effect of the tree decreases. A spruce seedling grown in natural humus from a Scots pine stand gathered more detectable archaea in its roots than a Scots pine seedling, but when grown in natural humus from a Norway spruce stand the detectable number of archaea in the Norway spruce roots was much reduced. It has been shown that different tree species affect the soil they live in, and that Norway spruce has a tendency to acidify the soil, while for example silver birch increase the soil pH. Acidic spruce needle litter also bring recalcitrant organic matter and phenolics to the soil, while birch litter increase soil organic matter and nitrogen. An even greater difference between tree species can be detected in the composition of bacterial groups in the rhizospheres and mycorrhizospheres of different boreal forest tree species. The fact that archaea are generally found only in the roots and rhizosphere, and not in the soil uncolonized by mycorrhizal fungi or tree roots indicate a relationship between the archaea and the ectomycorrhizal fungi and the tree. This chapter will concentrate on the archaea detected in the roots and mycorrhizosphere of boreal forest Norway spruce in comparison to other boreal tree species, but will also shortly touch on the subject of bacteria. {\textcopyright} 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - A brief account of fungi associated with kauri (Agathis australis) in New Zealand is followed by an annotated listing of all fungi known to grow on living or dead parts of this endemic tree. Records have been gleaned mainly from the New Zealand Fungal Herbarium (PDD), Herbarium of Forest Research (NZFRI(M)), and the literature. The fungi include few pathogens, mainly Phytophthora spp., and few agarics, as Agathis does not form ectomycorrhizae. Most fungi associated with A. australis are saprobes found on dead and fallen wood and litter. A total of 189 named species of fungi and 75 species identified only to genus, distributed within 199 genera, have been recorded. Many of the fungi are commonly found on other plant substrata within New Zealand, or elsewhere. Nineteen species have been described with A. australis as the type substratum. These species are saprobes and, apart from the Australasian endemic, Heterobasidion araucariae, all are currently considered to be endemic to New Zealand. Of these, most (12 species) are restricted to A. australis, with only 7 species known on wood or litter of other plants. {\textcopyright} 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In a study of fungi growing in various root-associated habitats in and around Picea mariana, black spruce, in northern Ontario, Canada, an examination was made of the degree to which differences in growth sites within an area of a few square kilometers might influence the structure of root-associated filamentous microfungal populations. Picea mariana roots were collected at four strongly differing boreal forest sites: an undisturbed forest site with deep litter and humus layers; a recently regenerated forest; a clearcut, former portable sawmill site with a few small, naturally regenerated trees; and an open peat bog penetrated by roots from trees growing along the margin. Comparisons were done on isolate assemblages primarily from serially washed mycorrhizae, supplemented with comparison samples from washed root bark and adherent rhizosphere soil. The Bray \& Curtis similarity index and nodal components analysis were utilised to identify trends within the data. Root endophyte fungi, mainly Phialocephala fortinii and Meliniomyces variabilis, were among the most common isolates from serially washed mycorrhizae and showed strong trends among the site types, with the former most common from sites low in humus and also low in known humus-associated microfungi, and the latter most common from the peat bog site. The overall composition of the isolate assemblages from washed mycorrhizae mainly reflected site factors, with assemblages from the undisturbed and regenerated forest sites similar to one another and those from the clearcut and peat bog sites strongly distinct. A major difference was also seen between two seasonal samples at the exposed clearcut site, but few seasonal differences were seen at the other sites. The regenerated and undisturbed forest sites were high in Umbelopsis isabellina, Mortierella verticillata and Penicillium spinulosum, fungi typical of humic horizons in boreal podzols; the clearcut yielded the greatest numbers of Fusarium proliferatum, Umbelopsis nana and Penicillium montanense isolates, an assemblage tending to indicate exposed mineral soil; while the peat bog was typified by the presence of characteristic northern peat inhabitants Mortierella pulchella and P spinulosum, as well as temperate peat inhabitant Penicillium lividum. A synthesis of these results with other data suggests that as a microhabitat, the mycorrhizosphere, as originally defined by Foster \& Marks, is of little significance in determining the structure of filamentous fungal populations in soil influenced by the presence of ectomycorrhizal forest tree roots. Edaphic and overall microbial community conditions are much more significant, but the influence of a ``symbiorhizosphere effect{''} exerted by certain ectomycorrhizal symbionts within the whole soil volume they occupy is also known in some cases and worthy of further investigation.

AB  - Nutrient cycling is greatly influenced by dominant plants that contribute high amounts of leaf litter to soils; however, less-dominant and rare species can play keystone roles in nutrient cycling if they have unique nutrient acquisition traits and provide high-quality litter. In many parts of the world, wildfire is likely to become more frequent and intense under a changing climate. The effect this will have on plant rarity and on species with unique nutrient acquisition traits, and thus nutrient cycling, remains poorly understood. Working within an Australian box-ironbark forest, we determined if a relationship existed between species rarity and the uniqueness of their leaf nutrient profiles, and if this relationship changed after prescribed burning. We created an index of species rarity from a data set of woody perennial species abundance in areas before and after autumn or spring burns, or left unburnt. We created indices of uniqueness for the leaf nutrient profiles of 42 woody perennial species occurring in the ecosystem, based on amounts of six macronutrients and four micronutrients found in fresh and senesced leaves of each species. Five nutrient acquisition strategies (mycorrhizal, N-fixing, carnivorous, hemiparasitic and proteoid roots) were represented in the data set. There was no community-wide relationship between rarity and uniqueness of leaf nutrient profiles, and this did not change as a result of fire. However, two hemiparasitic species were relatively rare in the ecosystem studied, and differed greatly from other species due to high K and P in senesced leaves. Thus, some of the rarest species, such as hemiparasites, can be functionally unique. Understanding the functional characteristics of rare species is important so that unique functional contributors can be identified and conserved to prevent local extinction. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Clear-cutting (CC) and slash burning (SB) are common silvicultural practices in subtropical China, yet the time-course response of soil CO2 efflux components to such disturbance is not well understood. This study examined the effects of CC and SB on soil CO2 efflux components in a Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook (Chinese fir, CF) plantation and a secondary evergreen broadleaved forest (BF) located in Fujian Province, southeastern China. Aboveground litter removal and root trenching were used to estimate CO2 fluxes from soil organic matter decomposition (RSOM), litter decomposition (RL), and autotrophic respiration by roots and mycorrhizae (RR). These components were measured 5–7 times per month from 18 October 2001 to 25 December 2003 using soda lime absorption. We found that RR, RL and RSOM were initially higher in CC and SB plots than controls in both forests, but these three component fluxes in disturbed plots all fell below those of the control 5–20 months after the disturbance. Also, Q10 values of these components decreased following disturbance. The annual flux of each respiration component was greater under BF than CF. The contribution of RR to soil CO2 efflux in the control plots averaged 35% in CF and 46% in BF. RSOM was the dominant component of soil CO2 efflux in CC and SB plots, accounting for over 50%. Our results highlight the importance of temporal trends of the component fluxes following disturbance and contribute to a broader understanding of forest management effects on the soil C cycle. {\textcopyright} 2016 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - Aims: Ecological forest succession can be influenced by plant-plant interactions that exert contrasting effects on early- and late-successional species. In this study, we explored the role of indirect plant-plant interactions and the underlying microbial mechanisms in forest succession. Methods: In a mesocosm experiment, we used Schima superba, a widespread mid-successional species in subtropical China, as a model species to explore how inoculating the rhizosphere soil of Schima affected the performances of two early-successional species (Pinus massoniana and Rhodomyrtus tomentosa) and two late-successional species (Cryptocarya chinensis and Machilus chinensis). All direct and indirect correlations between plant performance and soil microbial composition were examined using partial least square path models. Results: Schima inoculum inhibited the growth of the early-successional species but had little effect on the growth of the late-successional species. Inoculation reduced non-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (non-AMF) colonization in both species groups but increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization in the late-successional species. The percentage of root lesions in the early-successional species increased with inoculation, while that in the late-successional species decreased. Plant nutrient acquisition was not responsive to inoculation. According to the path models, soil microbes explained 51% of the growth variances in the early-successional species but barely explained any growth variances in the late species. Conclusions: Schima may increase the competitive advantage of the late-successional species over early-successional species by inhibiting the mutualistic association between non-AMF and the latter, which in turn may facilitate forest succession. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: The predictive power of climate models is limited by an incomplete understanding of the controls on fine root decomposition and thus belowground carbon cycling. To more accurately model rates of decay, fine root heterogeneity needs to be addressed in fine root decomposition studies. Branching order integrates both structural and chemical properties that are important in indicating litter quality and decay rate. Scope: We discuss current views on the controls and patterns of fine root decomposition in combination with recent findings related to the effects of branching order and mycorrhizal decomposition. We examine the counterintuitive finding that nitrogen rich, lower order roots decompose more slowly than woody, higher order roots in temperate and sub-tropical forests. Conclusions: We posit that slower decomposition of first and second compared to higher order roots might be caused by the poor carbon quality associated with higher concentrations of phenols in lower order roots or by inhibition of saprophytes by the mycorrhizal fungi that often preferentially inhabit these roots. Alternatively, apparent recalcitrance of lower order roots could be an experimental artifact caused by severing pre-mortem mycelial connections during sample processing, or exclusion of animals that graze fungal structures by the small mesh sizes characteristic of litterbags. To better predict the residence time of the carbon contained in the entire fine root pool, existing methods should be applied to individual root orders when practical. New methods for characterizing decomposition of undisturbed roots that have senesced naturally are greatly needed. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - In a forest grove at Korup dominated by the ectomycorrhizal species Microberlinia bisulcata, an experiment tested whether phosphorus (P) was a limiting nutrient. P-fertilization of seven subplots 1995-97 was compared with seven controls. It led to large increases in soil P concentrations. Trees were measured in 1995 and 2000. M. bisulcata and four other species were transplanted into the treatments, and a wild cohort of M. bisulcata seedlings was followed in both. Leaf litter fall from trees and seedlings were analysed for nutrients. Growth of trees was not affected by added P. Transplanted seedlings survived better in the controls than added-P subplots: they did not grow better with added-P. M. bisulcata wildlings survived slightly better in the added-P subplots in yr 1 but not later. Litter fall and transplanted survivors had much higher concentrations of P (not N) in the added-P than control subplots. Under current conditions, it appears that P does not limit growth of trees or hinder seedling establishment, especially of M. bisculcata, in these low-P grove soils. {\textcopyright} New Phytologist (2002).

AB  - This study aims at characterizing the diversity and temporal changes of species richness and composition of fungi in an ecotone of a forest border and a meadow in the Taunus mountain range in Germany. All macroscopically visible, epigeous fungi and vascular plants were sampled monthly over three years, together with climatic variables like humidity and temperature that influence fungal diversity and composition as shown by previous studies. In this mosaic landscape, a total of 855 fungal species were collected and identified based on morphological features, the majority of which belonged to Ascomycota (51 %) and Basidiomycota (45 %). Records of fungal species and plant species (218) for this area yielded a fungus to plant species ratio of 4:1, with a plant species accumulation curve that reached saturation. The three years of monitoring, however, were not sufficient to reveal the total fungal species richness and estimation factors showed that a fungus to plant species ratio of 6:1 may be reached by further sampling efforts. The effect of climatic conditions on fungal species richness differed depending on the taxonomic and ecological group, with temporal patterns of occurrence of Basidiomycota and mycorrhizal fungi being strongly associated with temperature and humidity, whereas the other fungal groups were only weakly related to abiotic conditions. In conclusion, long-term, monthly surveys over several years yield a higher diversity of macroscopically visible fungi than standard samplings of fungi in autumn. The association of environmental variables with the occurrence of specific fungal guilds may help to improve estimators of fungal richness in temperate regions. {\textcopyright} 2018 Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) constitutes the largest terrestrial C pool. An emerging, untested, view is that oxidation and depolymerization of SOM by microorganisms promote the formation of SOM-mineral associations that is critical for SOM stabilization. To test this hypothesis, we performed laboratory-scale experiments involving one ectomycorrhizal and one saprotrophic fungus that represent the two major functional groups of microbial decomposers in the boreal forest soils. Fungal decomposition enhanced the retention of SOM on goethite, partly because of oxidative modifications of organic matter (OM) by the fungi. Moreover, both fungi secreted substantial amounts (> 10% new biomass C) of aromatic metabolites that also contributed to an enhanced mineral retention of OM. Our study demonstrates that soil fungi can form mineral-stabilized SOM not only by oxidative conversion of the SOM but also by synthesizing mineral surface-reactive metabolites. Metabolites produced by fungal decomposers can play a yet overlooked role in the formation and stabilization of SOM. {\textcopyright} 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - • Fertilizer-induced reductions in CO2 flux from soil () in forests have previously been attributed to decreased carbon allocation to roots, and decreased decomposition as a result of nitrogen suppression of fungal activity. Here, we present evidence that decreased microbial respiration in the rhizosphere may also contribute to reductions in fertilized forest soils. • Fertilization reduced by 16-19% in 65-yr-old plantations of northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and in a natural 85-yr-old yellow birch (Betula allegheniensis) stand. • In oak plots, fertilization had no effects on fine root biomass but reduced mycorrhizal colonization by 18% and microbial respiration by 43%. In maple plots, fertilization reduced root biomass, mycorrhizal colonization and microbial respiration by 22, 16 and 46%, respectively. In birch plots, fertilization reduced microbial respiration by 36%, but had variable effects on root biomass and mycorrhizal colonization. • In plots of all three species, fertilization effects on microbial respiration were greater in rhizosphere than in bulk soil, possibly as a result of decreased rhizosphere carbon flux from these species in fertile soils. Because rhizosphere processes may influence nutrient availability and carbon storage in forest ecosystems, future research is needed to better quantify rhizo-microbial contributions to FCO2. {\textcopyright} The Authors (2007).

AB  - Leaf and root litter decomposition has been a major research focus. However, the possible effects of belowground microbial community structure and diversity on this process are poorly understood. Understanding the biochemical mechanisms controlling aboveground decomposition processes is important to predict the changes of soil carbon and nutrient cycling in response to changes of forest management regimes. Here, we explore the biochemical controls of leaf and fine root decomposition in three subtropical plantations (Ford Erythrophleum (Erythrophleum fordii Oliver), Masson Pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.)), and a mixed plantation containing both species) using the litterbag method, and soil microbial communities were determined using phospholipid fatty acid profiles. Overall, leaves decomposed more rapidly than fine roots, potentially due to the faster degradation of their cellulose component, but not lignin. In addition, leaf and fine root decomposition rates varied among plantations, being higher in E. fordii and lower in P. massoniana. Substrate quality such as N, Ca, lignin concentration, and C/N ratio were responsible for the decomposition rate changes among plantation types. Moreover, we used redundancy analysis to examine the relationships between litter decomposition and soil microbial community composition and diversity. Results revealed that actinobacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi community were the key determinants affecting leaf and fine root litter decomposition, respectively. Our work demonstrates that litter decomposition was linked to substrate quality and to the structure of soil microbial communities, and evidences the probable role of E. fordii in increasing soil nutrient availability, especially N, P and Ca. Additional data on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) or DNA marker groups within the litterbags over time may provide insights into litter decomposition dynamics, which represents potential objectives for future long-term decomposition studies. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Despite the important roles of microorganisms in soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and nutrient cycling, how their biomass, community composition and function are driven by a joint effect of edaphic and environmental factors at a large spatial scale remains unclear. Moreover, a mechanistic understanding of the associations among microbial communities and SOM chemistry as a key indicator of substrate availability over large spatial scales has been lacking until now. To fill this knowledge gap, we examined how soil microbial community abundance and composition (via phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis) and function (via enzyme activities and net N mineralization) were associated with the edaphic and environmental factors from six oriental oak (Quercus variabilis) forest sites arranged across a 11° latitudinal gradient in East China. We found strong relationships between SOM chemistry as indicated by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and microbial community composition and function along this gradient. For example, the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F/B) decreased with increasing carboxyl C percentage; the lower abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and decreased invertase activity in the southern sites were possibly related to higher ratio of alkyl to O alkyl (A/O); urease activity increased with carboxyl C percentage. Microbial biomass (total PLFAs) had positive relationships with urease activity, net N mineralization rate, and soil pH. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) and pH were important for overall microbial community composition. Overall, our results indicate that SOM chemistry is closely related to microbial community composition and function along the latitudinal gradient and should be considered in future studies. Our study contributes to a better prediction of microbial responses to possible substrate changes brought by future environmental changes, which is urgently needed under the context of accelerating global change. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Key message: Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community structure and potential exoenzymatic activity change after clearcut harvesting, but functional complementarity and redundancy among those ECM fungal species remaining support growth of regenerating seedlings. Abstract: Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community composition is altered by forest harvesting, but it is not clear if this shift in structure influences ECM fungal physiological function at the community level. In this study, we characterized activities of extracellular enzymes in the ectomycorrhizospheres of Picea engelmannii seedlings grown in forest and clearcut plots. These exoenzymes are critical for the breakdown of large organic molecules, from which nutrients are subsequently absorbed and translocated by ECM fungi to host plants. We found that ectomycorrhizae on seedlings planted in forests had different exoenzyme activity profiles than those on seedlings planted in clearcuts. Specifically, the activities of glucuronidase, laccase, and acid phosphatase were higher on forest seedlings (P ≤ 0.006). These differences may have been partly driven by soil properties. Total carbon, total nitrogen (N), extractable phosphorus, extractable ammonium-N, and mineralizable N were higher, while pH was lower in forest plots (P ≤ 0.01). However, we also found that enzyme activity only shifted where community composition also changed. Functional complementarity can be inferred within ECM fungal communities in both forests and clearcuts because ectomycorrhizae formed by different species in the same environment had distinct enzyme profiles (P < 0.0001). However, ectomycorrhizae of Thelephora terrestris exhibited high levels of N- and P-mobilizing exoenzyme activities. Seedling biomass did not differ between forest and clearcut environments, so the high abundance of T. terrestris ectomycorrhizae in the clearcuts may have sustained nutrient acquisition by clearcut seedlings even in soils with lower N and P and with reduced ECM fungal species richness. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The aimof the study was to assess the impact of severalmethods ofmulching degraded forest soilwithwood chips on the development ofmite (Acari) community,with particular emphasis to oribatid mites (Oribatida), andonthe growthof youngplantings of Scotspine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Mulching with wood chips should contribute to revitalize soil fauna and restore natural forests on degraded soils. Scots pine seedlings were planted at the post-military training ground. Four experimental treatments were tested: control-uncovered soil (C), mulching with wood chips (W),W+ mycorrhiza preparation (WM), andW+ forest litter (WL). At the end of the growing season in 2012, 2013 and 2014, the following plant measurements were carried out: length of annual increment of the main stem, stem base diameter, number and lengths of lateral shoots in the annual whorl. The mite calculations included average mite density, dominance index, species richness, oribatid mite diversity, average number of species, and Shannon general species diversity index. The use of mulching with wood chips did not significantly affect the growth characteristics of Scots pine plants, but strongly increased the mite community. After mulching, the total number and species diversity of Acari increased many times, and Oribatida began to dominate among micro-arthropods. The number of Oribatida increased most in W. The largest species diversity was observed in WL. 24 species of Oribatida were found that were used as the bio-indicators of soil succession changes. Tectocepheus velatus clearly dominated in all mulching treatments. Oppiella nova and Scutovertex sculptus were also numerous populations of Oribatida. The study shows that mulching with Scots pine wood chips, especially with the addition of forest litter, significantly enriches soil fauna and is therefore useful in the regeneration process of degenerated forest soils. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The most influential environmental drivers of macrofungal species composition were studied in managed, even-aged, mixed forests of orseg National Park, Hungary. Functional groups of macrofungi were analyzed separately by non-metric multidimensional scaling and redundancy analysis exploring their relations to tree species composition, stand structure, soil/litter conditions, microclimate, landscape, and management history. There was some evidence that macrofungi are related to drivers that are relatively easy to measure. Wood-inhabiting fungal species composition is driven primarily by the species composition of living trees, while substratum properties and microclimate play minor roles. The terricolous saprotrophic community was determined principally by a litter pH gradient involving tree species composition and soil/litter properties. Microclimate had no concordant effect. No obvious underlying gradients were detected on ectomycorrhizal fungal species composition; however, tree size and litter pH had significant effects. For each group, no clear responses to landscape or management history were detected. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fungal mycelium is increasingly recognized as a central component of soil biogeochemical cycling, yet our current understanding of the ecological controls on fungal necromass decomposition is limited to single sites and vegetation types. By deploying common fungal necromass substrates in a temperate oak savanna and hardwood forest in the midwestern USA, we assessed the generality of the rate at which high- and low-quality fungal necromass decomposes; further, we investigated how the decomposer ‘necrobiome' varies both across and within sites under vegetation types dominated by either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal plants. The effects of necromass quality on decay rate were robust to site and vegetation type differences, with high-quality fungal necromass decomposing, on average, 2.5 times faster during the initial stages of decay. Across vegetation types, bacterial and fungal communities present on decaying necromass differed from bulk soil microbial communities and were influenced by necromass quality. Moulds, yeasts and copiotrophic bacteria consistently dominated the necrobiome of high-quality fungal substrates. Synthesis. We show that regardless of differences in decay environments, high-quality fungal substrates decompose faster and support different types of decomposer micro-organisms when compared with low-quality fungal tissues. These findings help to refine our theoretical understanding of the dominant factors affecting fast cycling components of soil organic matter and the microbial communities associated with rapid decay. {\textcopyright} 2020 British Ecological Society

AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is an important component in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Yet, the relative importance of different inputs of DOC to the soil solution remains uncertain. Here, we used a large-scale forest girdling experiment to examine how the supply of recent photosynthate to tree roots and their mycorrhizal fungi affects DOC, in particular low-molecular weight organic acids (LMWOA). We also studied effects of tree girdling on non-structural carbohydrates in microorganism, and examined the effects of freezing of soil and the presence of roots in the soil samples on soil solution DOC and LMWOA in this experiment. The concentration of DOC was reduced by 40%, while citrate was reduced by up to 90% in the soil solution by the girdling treatment. Other LMWOA such as oxalate, succinate, formate and propionate were unaffected by the girdling. We also found that girdling reduced the concentrations of trehalose (by 50%), a typical fungal sugar, and of monosaccharides (by 40%) in microorganisms in root-free soil. The effect of freezing on DOC concentrations was marked in samples from control plots, but insignificant in samples from girdled plots. Release of DOC from cell lysis after freezing was attributed equally to roots and to microorganisms. Our observations suggest a direct link from tree photosynthesis through roots and their mycorrhizal fungi to soil solution chemistry. This direct link should impact solute transport and speciation, mineral weathering and C dynamics in the soil compartment. Importantly, our finding of a substantial photosynthate driven production of DOC challenges the paradigm that DOC is mainly the result of decomposition of organic matter. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Tropical forest productivity is sustained by the cycling of nutrients through decomposing organic matter. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a key role in the nutrition of tropical trees, yet there has been little experimental investigation into the role of AM fungi in nutrient cycling via decomposing organic material in tropical forests. We evaluated the responses of AM fungi in a long-term leaf litter addition and removal experiment in a tropical forest in Panama. We described AM fungal communities using 454-pyrosequencing, quantified the proportion of root length colonised by AM fungi using microscopy, and estimated AM fungal biomass using a lipid biomarker. AM fungal community composition was altered by litter removal but not litter addition. Root colonisation was substantially greater in the superficial organic layer compared with the mineral soil. Overall colonisation was lower in the litter removal treatment, which lacked an organic layer. There was no effect of litter manipulation on the concentration of the AM fungal lipid biomarker in the mineral soil. We hypothesise that reductions in organic matter brought about by litter removal may lead to AM fungi obtaining nutrients from recalcitrant organic or mineral sources in the soil, besides increasing fungal competition for progressively limited resources.

AB  - Allelopathy is one of the factors That determine interactions among plants. Allelochemicals have been found in many forest ecosystems, but the importance of allelopathic interactions depends on forest type and environmental conditions. Despite the wide presence of this phenomenon, its modelization has been little developed, but its inclusion should be carefully considered in forest models dealing with environmental stress, exotic plant invasions (or introduction) and ecological succession. In these situations, multiple factors influence allelochemical production or toxicity such as nutrient availability, soil moisture and texture, solar radiation, and temperature, among others. Ecosystem-level effects of allelopathy are changes in germination rates, inhibition of seedling growth, mycorrhizal function, insect and bacterial growth, inhibition of nitrification or litterfall decomposition and dieback of mature trees. In this work, a comprehensive conceptual model on the interactions between different factors suitable to be incorporated in ecosystem-level models is presented. In addition, to illustrate the utility of simulating allelopathy, a virtual experiment was carried out with the forest ecosystem-level model FORECAST applied in a forest of western red-cedar (Thuja plicata) interacting with the ericaceous understory shrub salal (Gaultheria shallon) in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Our results showed different effects of allelopathy on several ecological variables depending on the type of allelopathic influence simulated, with important reductions in predicted merchantable volume when reduction in germination and litterfall decomposition by allelopathy was simulated. Furthermore, a great increase in understory biomass was also predicted as consequence of allelopathy. This experiment showed the suitability of ecosystem-level models to simulate, if not directly allelopathic interactions, at least the ecological effects of allelopathy at the ecosystem level. Overall, this work pointed out that forest managers and researches should think carefully about the inclusion of allelopathy as a way of improving the accuracy of forest models.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi are thought to have a key role in mobilizing organic nitrogen that is trapped in soil organic matter (SOM). However, the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi decompose SOM and the mechanism by which they do so remain unclear, considering that they have lost many genes encoding lignocellulose-degrading enzymes that are present in their saprotrophic ancestors. Spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome profiling were used to examine the mechanisms by which five species of ectomycorrhizal fungi, representing at least four origins of symbiosis, decompose SOM extracted from forest soils. In the presence of glucose and when acquiring nitrogen, all species converted the organic matter in the SOM extract using oxidative mechanisms. The transcriptome expressed during oxidative decomposition has diverged over evolutionary time. Each species expressed a different set of transcripts encoding proteins associated with oxidation of lignocellulose by saprotrophic fungi. The decomposition 'toolbox' has diverged through differences in the regulation of orthologous genes, the formation of new genes by gene duplications, and the recruitment of genes from diverse but functionally similar enzyme families. The capacity to oxidize SOM appears to be common among ectomycorrhizal fungi. We propose that the ancestral decay mechanisms used primarily to obtain carbon have been adapted in symbiosis to scavenge nutrients instead. {\textcopyright} 2016 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - In this study, we explore two mycorrhizal groups during development of riparian soils along a freely-flowing river. We provide the first documentation of a shift in abundance between arbuscular mycorrhizae and ectomycorrhizae during floodplain succession. We used a chronosequence spanning 0-70 yr along a river in northwestern Montana, USA, to test the hypothesis that abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is greatest in early stages of soil development, and abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF) is greatest later in floodplain succession. We also measured the AMF-mediated process of formation of soil aggregates during site development. AMF colonization of the dominant tree (black cottonwood, Populus trichocarpa) remained low (<5%), while AMF colonization of understory species was high (45-90%), across the chronosequence. Mycorrhizal inoculum potential (MIP) and hyphal length of AMF in soil peaked within the first 13 yr of succession and then declined. No single variable significantly correlated with AMF abundance, but AMF tended to decline as litter and soil organic matter increased. Density of ectomycorrhizal root tips in soil increased linearly throughout the chronosequence, and ectomycorrhizal colonization of cottonwood roots increased rapidly in early stages of succession. These patterns suggest that ECMF are not limited by dispersal, but rather influenced by abundance of host plants. Formation of water stable aggregates increased rapidly during the first third of the chronosequence, which was the period of greatest AMF abundance in the soil. The peak in AMF infectivity and hyphal length during early succession suggests that regular flooding and establishment of new sites promotes AMF abundance in this ecosystem. Regulation of rivers that eliminates creation of new sites may reduce contributions of AMF to riparian areas. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Observed on a 5 × 5 cm small surface of litter in a 35‐years‐old Scots pine stand with bracken and the moss Pseudoscleropodium purum, the F1 layer is extensively invaded by a mycelial mat made of several mycorrhizal fungi. Observations under a light microscope gave circumstantial evidence of the role of these fungi in advanced stages of decomposition: they seem to protect the partly decayed plant material and the faeces deposited by soil animals from subsequent attack by soil bacteria. Penetration of pine needles and cadavers or soil arthropods is prominent in so far as animals have previously made entries by tunnelling into the substrates. In addition the black mycorrhizal fungus Cenococcum geophilum was observed to penetrate bracken epidermal cells by its own means and to make lysis zones in dead arthropod cuticles. Consequences for forest soil ecology and tree nutrition are discussed in view of existing literature. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Beech forests reaches its native distribution limit in SE Norway, but is expected to expand substantially northwards due to climate warming. This may potentially result in a fundamental transformation of contemporary Northern European forests, with tentative effects on the associated belowground fungi. Fungal communities mediate vital ecosystem processes such as ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration in boreal forests. To investigate how soil fungi is affected by the vegetation transition from spruce to beech forest, we sampled litter, humus and mineral soil in a forest landscape dominated by beech, spruce or a mixture of these. The fungal communities in the soil samples were analyzed by DNA metabarcoding of the rDNA ITS2 region. Although soil layers were the most important structuring gradient, we found clear differences in fungal species composition between spruce and beech plots. The differences in fungal community composition were most evident in the litter and least in the mineral soil. Decomposers, most notably Mycena, dominated the litter layer while various mycorrhizal fungi dominated the humus and mineral layers. Some ectomycorrhizal taxa, such as Cenoccocum and Russula, were more abundant in spruce forests. Differences in fungal community composition between forest types can potentially have large impacts on carbon sequestration rates. Spruce and beech as local determinants of forest fungal community structure in litter, humus and mineral soil.

AB  - Nearly all tree species develop symbiotic relationships with either arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi to acquire nutrients from soils, and hence influence soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. It is crucial to understand the differences in soil C and N cycles between AM and EM forests and the underlying mechanisms. In this review, we first compared the differences in the soil C and N cycles between AM and EM forests, and synthesized the underlying mechanisms from perspectives of the inputs, stabilization, and outputs of soil C and N in forest ecosystems. We also compared the responses of soil C and N cycles between AM and EM forests to global changes. In this field, one major research priority is comparing the structure and function (including the soil C and N cycles) between AM and EM forest ecosystems to provide theoretical basis and solid data for improving forest productivity and ecosystem services. The second research focus is deepening the understanding of the effects of interactions between aboveground litter and belowground mycorrhiza and free-living microbes on soil C and N cycles to reveal the potential underlying mechanisms in forests with different mycorrhizal symbioses. Third, the research methodology and new techniques need refining and applying to explicitly focus on scaling up the fine-scale measurements to better expound and predict the C and N cycles in forest ecosystems. Finally, more studies on the stability of soil organic matter among different mycorrhizal forests are needed to precisely assess responses of the structure and function of forest ecosystems to global changes.

AB  - Root-associated fungi, particularly ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), are critical symbionts of all boreal tree species. Although climatically driven increases in wildfire frequency and extent have been hypothesized to increase vegetation transitions from tundra to boreal forest, fire reduces mycorrhizal inoculum. Therefore, changes in mycobiont inoculum may potentially limit tree-seedling establishment beyond current treeline. We investigated whether ectomycorrhizal shrubs that resprout after fire support similar fungal taxa to those that associate with tree seedlings that establish naturally after fire. We then assessed whether mycobiont identity correlates with the biomass or nutrient status of these tree seedlings. The majority of fungal taxa observed on shrub and seedling root systems were EMF, with some dark septate endophytes and ericoid mycorrhizal taxa. Seedlings and adjacent shrubs associated with similar arrays of fungal taxa, and there were strong correlations between the structure of seedling and shrub fungal communities. These results show that resprouting postfire shrubs support fungal taxa compatible with tree seedlings that establish after wildfire. Shrub taxon, distance to the nearest shrub and fire severity influenced the similarity between seedling and shrub fungal communities. Fungal composition was correlated with both foliar C:N ratio and seedling biomass and was one of the strongest explanatory variables predicting seedling biomass. While correlative, these results suggest that mycobionts are important to nutrient acquisition and biomass accrual of naturally establishing tree seedlings at treeline and that mycobiont taxa shared by resprouting postfire vegetation may be a significant source of inoculum for tree-seedling establishment beyond current treeline. {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Questions: How does the abundance and richness of plant assemblages with different functional (regeneration and nutrient acquisition) traits vary with fire regime, moisture availability and substrate fertility? What is the role of different functional traits in maintaining plant diversity under changing environmental conditions in seasonally dry and fire-prone environments? Location: Southwest Western Australia. Methods: Plant species abundance and soil nutrients were determined at 16 forest sites with variable fire histories across an aridity gradient. All plant species were classified based on their functional traits as (1) perennial or annual, (2) ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal, orchid mycorrhizal, proteoid or other non-mycorrhizal, (3) resprouters or seeder, and (4) nitrogen fixer or non-fixer. We used a multivariate (fourth-corner) technique to simultaneously test the significance and direction of the relationship between each of these traits and fire frequency, fire interval length, aridity, and soil N, P and C fractions. Results: The functional response of the vegetation to fire regime was minor and restricted to annual species, which comprised only $\sim$4% of taxa. Proteoid and ectomycorrhizal species dominated over species with arbuscular and orchid mycorrhizal roots, N-fixers dominated over non-fixers, and seeders dominated over resprouters when N fertility was low but organic labile P was high. Further, proteoid and ectomycorrhizal species richness increased with aridity, while arbuscular mycorrhizal species richness decreased. Conclusions: While the functional composition of southwest Australian vegetation is largely insensitive to changes in fire regime, nutrient acquisition and, to a lesser extent, regeneration traits provide mechanisms for the vegetation community to adjust to changes in resource availability. Thus, diversity responses to environmental change in seasonally dry and fire-prone ecosystems are likely to be primarily mediated by the composition of nutrient acquisition traits in the vegetation community. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Association for Vegetation Science.

AB  - This paper reviews the role of soil respiration in determining ecosystem carbon balance, and the conceptual basis for measuring and modeling soil respiration. We developed it to provide background and context for this special issue on soil respiration and to synthesize the presentations and discussions at the workshop. Soil respiration is the largest component of ecosystem respiration. Because autotrophic and heterotrophic activity belowground is controlled by substrate availability, soil respiration is strongly linked to plant metabolism, photosynthesis and litterfall. This link dominates both base rates and short-term fluctuations in soil respiration and suggests many roles for soil respiration as an indicator of ecosystem metabolism. However, the strong links between above and belowground processes complicate using soil respiration to understand changes in ecosystem carbon storage. Root and associated mycorrhizal respiration produce roughly half of soil respiration, with much of the remainder derived from decomposition of recently produced root and leaf litter. Changes in the carbon stored in the soil generally contribute little to soil respiration, but these changes, together with shifts in plant carbon allocation, determine ecosystem carbon storage belowground and its exchange with the atmosphere. Identifying the small signal from changes in large, slow carbon pools in flux dominated by decomposition of recent material and autotrophic and mycorrhizal respiration is a significant challenge. A mechanistic understanding of the belowground carbon cycle and of the response of different components to the environment will aid in identifying this signal. Our workshop identified information needs to help build that understanding: (1) the mechanisms that control the coupling of canopy and belowground processes; (2) the responses of root and heterotrophic respiration to environment; (3) plant carbon allocation patterns, particularly in different forest developmental stages, and in response to treatments (warming, CO2, nitrogen additions); and (4) coupling measurements of soil respiration with aboveground processes and changes in soil carbon. Multi-factor experiments need to be sufficiently long to allow the systems to adjust to the treatments. New technologies will be necessary to reduce uncertainty in estimates of carbon allocation, soil carbon pool sizes, and different responses of roots and microbes to environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.

AB  - Understanding the context dependence of ecosystem responses to global changes requires the development of new conceptual frameworks. Here we propose a framework for considering how tree species and their mycorrhizal associates differentially couple carbon (C) and nutrient cycles in temperate forests. Given that tree species predominantly associate with a single type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi), and that the two types of fungi differ in their modes of nutrient acquisition, we hypothesize that the abundance of AM and ECM trees in a plot, stand, or region may provide an integrated index of biogeochemical transformations relevant to C cycling and nutrient retention. First, we describe how forest plots dominated by AM tree species have nutrient economies that differ in their C-nutrient couplings from those in plots dominated by ECM trees. Secondly, we demonstrate how the relative abundance of AM and ECM trees can be used to estimate nutrient dynamics across the landscape. Finally, we describe how our framework can be used to generate testable hypotheses about forest responses to global change factors, and how these dynamics can be used to develop better representations of plant-soil feedbacks and nutrient constraints on productivity in ecosystem and earth system models. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

AB  - While multiple lines of evidence suggests that root carbon (C) can significantly impact the soil organic C (SOC) pool and subsequent C cycles via rhizosphere priming effects, the relative magnitude of the effects that root- and fungal-derived C inputs have in driving the priming of SOC decomposition are currently unknown. In this study, we used ingrowth cores and stable C isotope analyses to quantify root- and mycelium-derived C sequestered in soil labile and recalcitrant C pools and their relative contributions to the decomposition of native SOC in a spruce-fir-dominated coniferous forest on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China. The results showed that new C sequestered in the soil labile C pool was primarily (77%) from mycelium-derived C, while 60% of the root-derived C sequestered in the soil was incorporated into the recalcitrant pool. Furthermore, although the total native SOC pool was not significantly influenced by new C derived from both roots and mycelia, mycelium-derived C induced a remarkably greater negative priming effect (−12.0%) on the native labile C pool than did root-derived C (−5.8%); in contrast, mycelium-derived C induced a greater positive priming effect (13.8%) than root-derived C (7.1%) on the native recalcitrant C pool. Collectively, our findings suggest that mycelium-derived C make a greater contribution to the newly sequestered C in the soil labile C pool than root-derived C, thereby inducing a remarkably greater positive priming effect on the decomposition of native soil recalcitrant C. Therefore, mycelium-derived C inputs may play a dominant role in soil C dynamics and long-term C storage, at least in alpine forest ecosystems where ectomycorrhizal mutualisms dominate. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 1. Root-derived inputs are increasingly viewed as primary controls of soil organic matter (SOM) formation; however, we have a limited understanding of how root decay rates depend on soil factors, and how decaying roots influence the breakdown of leaf litter and SOM. 2. We incubated root and leaf litter (alone and in combination) from arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees in soils collected from forest plots dominated by AM and ECM trees in a factorial design. In each microcosm, we quantified litter decay rates and the effects of decaying litters on soil C balance. We hypothesized that (1) AM root litters would decompose faster than ECM root litters, (2) root litter decay would be greatest when decomposed in ``home{''} soils (e.g. AM litters in AM soils and ECM litters in ECM soils) and (3) root and leaf litters would decompose faster when decaying in the same microcosms than when decaying in separate microcosms, resulting in the largest CO2 losses. 3. Overall, AM root litter decomposed faster than ECM root litter, and the magnitude of this effect depended on soil origin. AM litters decayed fastest in AM soils, but ECM and mixed AM-ECM litters were unaffected by soil origin. Decaying roots increased leaf litter mass loss, but only in microcosms containing soils of the same origin (e.g. AM litters in AM soils; mixed litters in mixed soils). 4. Carbon losses were dominated by microbial respiration, and the magnitude of this flux depended on litter type and soil origin. When leaves and roots decayed together, respiratory losses exceeded those from microcosms containing leaves and roots alone, with the largest losses occurring in each litters' ``home{''} soil. In AM soils, elevated losses were driven by roots accelerating leaf decay, while in ECM soils, elevated losses resulted from roots and leaves accelerating the decay of SOM; in mixed soils, root-induced increases in leaf and SOM decay contributed to elevated C losses. 5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that root, leaf and SOM decay are intertwined, and that measurements of these processes in isolation may lead to incorrect estimates of the magnitude and source of C losses from soils.

AB  - "Temperate" forests occur at the mid-latitudes, between 23.5 and 66.5° N and S, where they cover approximately 20 % of the available land area and are characterized by distinct seasonal climate cycles. Temperate forests are dominated by plants with a woody, treelike growth form, and they produce relatively closed canopies (60-100 % areal canopy coverage). Temperate forests occur across a broad range of climate zones, including those with moist, warm summers (e.g., deciduous forests in North America and Europe) and dry, cool summers (e.g., montane and subalpine forests in North America, South America, and Europe). Temperate forest ecosystems exhibit carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios that are higher (often >100-200) than other temperate-latitude ecosystems, due to Classic, historical concepts in ecology, such as "succession," have been developed from studies of temperate forest ecosystems. Forest succession refers to decadal-scale transitions in community composition. Each shift in community composition causes changes in the forest microenvironment, which in turn causes further changes in community composition. Traditionally, this pattern of progressive change in community composition and associated feedbacks to forest microenvironment was viewed within a highly deterministic framework. More recently, ecological concepts, such as "gap theory," have emerged from the older concepts of succession and have been developed with greater emphasis on stochasticity. Both succession and gap theory has contributed greatly to our understanding of the causes of natural and anthropogenic changes to the species composition of temperate forest ecosystems. Nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P) are cycled through temperate forest ecosystems through a process of coupled recycling involving serial relationships between plants and soil microorganisms. N or P that is deposited to the soil through litter production is transformed from organic to inorganic forms through microbial mineralization, producing nitrate and phosphate ions, which can then be re-assimilated by plants and used to construct new organic biomass. Leaching of phosphate and nitrate from forest soils (especially nitrate in temperate forests) prior to re-assimilation by plants represents an important nutrient loss process and often limits forest biomass production. Root-fungal symbioses, called mycorrhizae, are well developed in temperate forest ecosystems. The hyphal biomass from the fungus radiates from associated roots and increases the capacity for trees to capture nitrate and phosphate prior to leaching and, in some cases, allows trees to take up organic nitrogen (such as small proteins or single molecules of amino acids). The acquisition of organic forms of nitrogen (and to some extent phosphorus) "short-circuits" the conventional form of biogeochemical cycles (alternating between plants and microbes) and increases the efficiency of nutrient retention in the ecosystem. Most water that is cycled through forests is used to sustain a favorable energy balance. Evapotranspiration from forests facilitates the loss of heat that is absorbed as net radiation (from the sun and sky) and returns water to the atmosphere, thus sustaining the terrestrial water cycle. Trees in temperate forests (especially in North America and Europe) have been exposed to increasing physiological stress in recent decades due to the increased frequency of drought and high temperatures. These stresses have the potential to reduce forest growth and may be responsible for the observed weakening of forest carbon sinks globally. Climate-induced stress, in turn, exposes temperate forests to an increased frequency of epidemic insect outbreaks and associated high rates of herbivory, as well as shorter fire return cycles. The combination of abiotic and biotic stress is likely responsible for an increase in observed mass tree mortality in temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere. Greater frequencies of alternations between years with extreme climates (e.g., wetter-than-average years followed by drier-than-average years) have the potential to convert less damaging surface fires into more damaging crown fires due to the buildup of beneath-canopy fuels and greater connectivity of lower-elevation grasslands that border higher-elevation forests, during wet years, followed by greater ignition potential during dry years. Given changes in the Earth's climate system that increase the threat to fire-and insect-induced mass tree mortality in temperate forests, effective management of these ecosystems has become even more urgent and important to responsible stewardship of our natural resources. Future management efforts should be designed on a solid foundation of scientific knowledge about forest succession, forest biogeochemistry, and the natural relations of forests to fire return cycles and cycles of higher and lower levels of insect herbivory. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

AB  - The effects of a prescribed fire on the presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi on the root tips of ponderosa pine were investigated one year after a prescribed ground fire. Ectomycorrhizas were sampled within 1 m(2) plots before and one year after the fire, and in nearby control plots that were not burned. The cores were divided into litter/organic, upper mineral, and lower mineral layers. The total ectomycorrhizal biomass in the control plots did not differ between year one and rear two samples for any core layer, while in the fire plots the destruction of the litter/organic layer resulted in an eight-fold reduction in total ectomycorrhizal biomass. Mycorrhizal biomass in the two mineral layers was not significantly reduced by the fire. We used molecular tools to identify fungi directly from the ectomycorrhizas. In unburned plots members of the Russulaceae and Thelephoraceae were among the most frequent and abundant ectomycorrhizal types; species of most other taxa were rare. In the control plots these two families were among the dominant species in both years, but patchiness on a fine spatio-temporal scale caused some major changes in ranking of individual species between sample years. Rhizopogon subcaerulescens was the most pronounced example: its biomass in the control plot samples was seven times greater in year two than in year one because of an exceptionally large cluster of mycorrhizas encountered in a single core. The effect of fire on individual species was difficult to assess because of this patchiness and because all species were low in abundance after the fire. The most abundant pre-fire species were reduced to undetectable post-fire levels, while several less abundant species, including R. subcaerulescens, Cenococcum geophilum, and several unknown types were not substantially reduced by the fire. We speculate that the more abundant species, Martellia sp., thelephoroid 1, and Tomentella sublilacina, were differentially affected because their dominance was most prominent at the litter and organic layers. In any case, a short-term effect of this fire appears to be increased species evenness.

AB  - Humans have altered the global nitrogen (N) cycle, greatly increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition in industrialized regions of the world. Groundcover plants can be sensitive indicators of nitrogen deposition impacts. Here, we report results from repeated measurements over a 7 year period of groundcover (plants <1.4 m tall) and understory (plants with a diameter <5 cm at 1.4 m in height) vegetation in four mature northern hardwood forests in the north-central United States receiving experimental additions of N (3 g m(-2) year(-1) as NaNO3 for 18 years). Experimental N deposition reduced the average abundance of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) seedlings in the groundcover by >50\% (P < 0.001). This reduction occurred at all four sites, but was only statistically significant at the two sites where these seedlings were most abundant (site x nitrogen: P < 0.001). Our observations of mortality within a large cohort of sugar maple seedlings across three sites provide further evidence of this effect. For these seedlings, experimental N deposition significantly (P < 0.05) increased mortality in the weeks following germination, as well as over the longer term, reducing overall survival after 5 years by almost 90\%. Although groundcover plants accounted for <0.5\% of aboveground plant biomass, they contributed up to 10\% of ecosystem leaf area and 5\% of aboveground litter. At the two sites where sugar maple seedlings were infrequent, understory vegetation was more abundant and dominated by hop-hornbeam (Ostrya virginiana (Miller) K. Koch; 42\% of all stems). At these two sites, experimental N deposition significantly reduced the abundance of understory hop-hornbeam by more than 75\% (site x nitrogen: P = 0.008). The effects of experimental N deposition on the understory and groundcover vegetation occurred without significant decreases in reproductive litter or increases in canopy leaf area. Instead, the negative effects are more likely a by-product of other documented changes caused by the experimental N deposition: increased forest floor mass, decreased mycorrhizal abundance, and increased production of potentially alleopathic phenolic compounds. Because the late-successional species in these forests rely upon groundcover and understory plants for regeneration, the effects of added N on this vegetation have potential implications for future forest composition, particularly given the likely loss of some species in these forests due to exotic pests and pathogens.

AB  - Testate amoebae (TA) are an important part of soil microbial communities and in certain ecosystems they may represent a substantial proportion of total microbial biomass. Their distribution and abundance is driven by various abiotic factors (e.g., pH, organic matter, soil moisture, soil/water chemistry) but comparatively less is known about the role of biotic interactions. TA often co-occur with Ericaceae, a ubiquitous plant family inhabiting acidic soils with poor nutrient status. Ericaceae can significantly change soil properties through production of recalcitrant litter and possibly also due to root exudates and activities of root-inhabiting fungi; this may result in profound modifications of microbial communities. A recent study from northwest England showed that the invasive ericaceous shrub Rhododendron ponticum may significantly modify communities of soil TA. Here, we investigate the effect of pH, organic matter, and R. ponticum presence on TA communities within the native range of the ericaceous shrub at two sites in southern Spain and compare our results with the previous study from NW England. At the Spanish sites, organic matter content, R. ponticum presence and pH affected occurrence and abundance of several TA species; R. ponticum presence and organic matter content were highly correlated and explained most of the observed variability in TA communities (i.e. the effect of the R. ponticum rhizosphere). R. ponticum rhizosphere affected especially TA with relatively large tests, i.e., Cyclopyxis eurystoma, Phryganella acropodia and Trigonopyxis arcula. Interestingly, T. arcula was also positively associated with R. ponticum in the previously studied British sites. The rhizosphere of the ericaceous shrub appears to have a positive effect on testate amoebae taxon richness at the two studied autochthonous Spanish sites but may reduce taxon richness in the sites in Britain where R. ponticum is an introduced species. Such possible positive/negative effects of native/invasive species, as well as other plant guilds, on TA communities clearly deserve further investigation.

AB  - Aboveground species richness patterns of vascular plants, aphyllophoroid macrofungi, bryophytes and lichens were compared along an altitudinal gradient (80–310 m a.s.l.) on the Slantsevaya mountain at the eastern macroslope of the Polar Urals (Russia). Five altitudinal levels were included in the study: (1) Northern boreal forest with larch-spruce in the Sob' river valley habitats; (2–3) two levels of closed, northern boreal, larch-dominated forests on the slopes; (4) crook-stemmed forest; (5) tundra habitats above the timberline. Vascular plant or bryophyte species richness was not affected by altitudinal levels, but lichen species richness significantly increased from the river valley to the tundra. For aphyllophoroid macrofungi, species richness was highest at intermediate and low altitudes, and poorest in the tundra. These results indicate a positive ecotone effect on aphyllophoroid fungal species richness. The species richness of aphyllophoroid fungi as a whole was neither correlated to mortmass stocks, nor to species richness of vascular plants, but individual ecological or morphological groups depended on these parameters. Poroid fungal species richness was positively correlated to tree age, wood biomass and crown density, and therefore peaked in the middle of the slope and at the foot of the mountain. In contrast, clavarioid fungal species richness was negatively related to woody bio-and mortmass, and therefore peaked in the tundra. This altitudinal level was characterized by high biomass proportions of lichens and mosses, and by high litter mortmass. The proportion of corticoid fungi increased with altitude, reaching its maximum at the timberline. Results from the different methods used in this work were concordant, and showed significant patterns. Tundra communities differ significantly from the forest communities, as is also confirmed by nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses based on the spectrum of morphological and ecological groups of aphyllophoroid fungi. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Soil respiration fluxes were measured continuously in order to assess the degree to which they were influenced by spatial and temporal variation in soil moisture. The synergistic effects of the variation in soil moisture with the one in soil temperature, soil organic matter and global radiation on respiration fluxes were also analysed. The measurements were performed using an open chamber system along a hydrological gradient in a Norway spruce forest in south Sweden (Skogaby) for 3 weeks in June 1995. The measured soil respiration fluxes were quite stable and somewhat larger compared with those reported in literature. The experiment took place during the shoot elongation period with intensive nutrient uptake, and it might be that soil respiration was dominated by mycorrhizal activity. Variation in the moisture content of the litter layer accounted for most of the spatial variation in respiration fluxes.

AB  - The effects of logging on forest ecosystems are severe and long-lasting. In addition, these effects are often paralleled with shifts in soil fungal community composition and functional guilds with potential feedbacks on ecosystem functioning. Clarifying how soil fungal communities are linked to the effects of historical logging could help us better understand the ecological consequences of logging. Here, we collected soils from 61 25 m × 25 m quadrats across a 160-km2 tropical rainforest in Hainan Island, China, which had been partially clear cut or selectively harvested and left to recover for up to 50 years. Soil fungal community composition and species co-variation networks were investigated in the selectively harvested (select cut) and clear cut forest stands and were compared to data from the primary stands without a history of logging. Historical logging shifted fungal community composition from Zygomycota towards Basidiomycota domination mainly through modifying vegetation composition and soil properties. The relative abundance of root associated fungi (i.e., ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal), animal pathogens and wood saprotrophs increased 50 years after logging, while the relative abundance of undefined saprotrophs decreased. In select cut stands, the fungal community was better organized with higher numbers of functionally interrelated operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and more generalist OTUs. In contrast, the number of functionally interrelated OTUs was lowest in the fungal network in clear cut stands. By comparing the topological roles of the shared OTUs among the three types of forest stands, we found role-shifts among fungal members from the specialists in the primary stands to the generalists in the select cut stands. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the major phyla involved in the role-shifts. Moreover, the fungal network in primary stands was positively associated with litter nutrients, while that in select cut stands was positively related to soil nutrients content. This indicated that the major drivers of fungal community organization shifted from litter nutrients content in the primary forest towards soil nutrients content in the selectively harvested forest. In the clear cut stands, however, the associations between fungal network and both litter and soil nutrients content decreased when compared with those in the primary and select cut stands. More than 60% of the total links among fungal members in clear cut stands were negative, implying a trend of niche partitioning among fungal groups with a half-century recovery after clearcutting in the tropical rainforest. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forests globally are facing an increasing number of threats from modified disturbance regimes, novel stressors and changing environmental conditions. This has ultimately resulted in declines in the ecological condition of many forest and woodland ecosystems, leading to widespread tree mortality and stand dieback. Effective indicators of overall woodland ecological condition are therefore needed for environmental monitoring and to support management responses. To test the effectiveness of different variables that could potentially be used as indicators of woodland condition, 102 variables that describe woodland structure, composition, functioning, edaphic conditions and disturbance regimes were assessed along 12 replicate gradients of beech stand dieback. Results indicated that 35 variables differed significantly between at least two stages of the dieback gradient, indicating their sensitivity to stand dieback. Seven of these indicators related to woodland species composition, two to functional processes, 20 to structural features, four to edaphic conditions, and two to disturbance regimes. These results demonstrate that effective indicators can potentially be identified for each of the ecological categories. Effective composition indicators included species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi, ground flora and epiphytic lichens; functional indicators were soil respiration rate and net nitrification rate; edaphic conditions included soil Na:Ca ratio, exchangeable sodium, total carbon, Ca:Al ratio; structural indicators included canopy openness, litter cover, sward height, and volume of deadwood, and for disturbance the indicator was Equus dung density. Other measures, such as shrub cover and species richness of carabid beetles and spiders, were not found to vary significantly along the dieback gradients, and were therefore not identified as effective indicators. These results demonstrate the value of gradient analysis for evaluating indicators of woodland condition, but also highlight the need for multi-site studies to identify indicators with widescale applicability. {\textcopyright} 2019

AB  - Forest soil organic matter (SOM) is an important dynamic store of C and N, which releases plant available N and the greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O. Early stages of decomposition of recent plant litters are better known than the formation of older and more stable soil pools of N and C, in which case classic theory stated that selective preservation of more resistant plant compounds was important. Recent insights heighten that all plant matter becomes degraded and that older SOM consists of compounds proximally of microbial origin. It has been proposed that in boreal forests, ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF), symbionts of trees, are actively involved in the formation of slowly-degrading SOM. We characterized SOM in the mor-layer along a local soil N supply gradient in a boreal forest, a gradient with large variations in chemical and biological characteristics, notably a decline in the biomass of ECMF in response to increasing soil N supply. We found contrasting and regular patterns in carbohydrates, lignin, aromatic carbon, and in N-containing compounds estimated by solid-state 13C and 15N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These occurred along with parallel changes in the natural abundances of the stable isotopes 13C and 15N in both bulk SOM and extracted fractions of the SOM. The modelled “bomb-14C″ age of the lower layers studied ranged between 15 years at the N-poor end, to 70 years at the N-rich end of the gradient. On average half the increase in $\delta$13C with soil depth (and hence age) of the mor-layer can be attributed to soil processes and the other half to changes in the isotopic composition of the plant C inputs. There was a decrease in carbohydrates (O-alkyl C) with increasing depth. This supports the classical hypothesis of declining availability of easily decomposable substrates to microorganisms with increasing soil depth and age. The observed increase in $\delta$13C with depth, however, speaks against the idea of selective preservation of more resistant plant compounds like lignin. Furthermore, from the N-poor to the N-rich end the difference between 15N in plant litter N and N in the deeper part of the mor-layer, the H-layer, decreased in parallel with a decline in ECMF. The latter provides evidence that the role of ECMF as major sink for N diminishes, and hence their potential role in SOM stabilization, when the soil N supply increases. At the N-rich end, where bacteria dominate over fungi, other agents than ECMF must be involved in the large build-up of the H-layer with the slowest turnover rate found along the gradient. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors

AB  - P>Mycoheterotrophic orchids have adapted to shaded forest understory by shifting to achlorophylly and receiving carbon from their mycorrhizal fungi. In temperate forests, they associate in a highly specific way with fungi forming ectomycorrhizas on nearby trees, and exploiting tree photosynthates. However, many rainforests lack ectomycorrhizal fungi, and there is evidence that some tropical Asiatic species associate with saprotrophic fungi. To investigate this in different geographic and phylogenetic contexts, we identified the mycorrhizal fungi supporting two tropical mycoheterotrophic orchids from Mascarene (Indian Ocean) and Caribbean islands. We tested their possible carbon sources by measuring natural nitrogen (15N) and carbon (13C) abundances. Saprotrophic basidiomycetes were found: Gastrodia similis associates with a wood-decaying Resinicium (Hymenochaetales); Wullschlaegelia aphylla associates with both litter-decaying Gymnopus and Mycena species, whose rhizomorphs link orchid roots to leaf litter. The 15N and 13C abundances make plausible food chains from dead wood to G. similis and from dead leaves to W. aphylla. We propose that temperature and moisture in rainforests, but not in most temperate forests, may favour sufficient saprotrophic activity to support development of mycoheterotrophs. By enlarging the spectrum of mycorrhizal fungi and the level of specificity in mycoheterotrophic orchids, this study provides new insights on orchid and mycorrhizal biology in the tropics.

AB  - In this study we show that the natural abundance of the nitrogen isotope 15, delta(15)N, Of plants in heath tundra and at the tundra-forest ecocline is closely correlated with the presence and type of mycorrhizal association in the plant roots. A total of 56 vascular plant species, 7 moss species, 2 lichens and 6 species of fungi from four heath and forest tundra sites in Greenland, Siberia and Sweden were analysed for delta(15)N and N concentration. Roots of vascular plants were examined for mycorrhizal colonization, and the soil organic matter was analysed for delta(15)N,N concentration and soil inorganic, dissolved organic and microbial N. No arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonizations were found although potential host plants were present in all sites. The dominant species were either ectomycorrhizal (ECM) or ericoid mycorrhizal (ERI). The delta(15)N of ECM or ERI plants was 3.5-7.7\%, lower than that of non-mycorrhizal (NON) species in three of the four sites. This corresponds to the results in our earlier study of mycorrhiza and plant delta(15)N which was limited to one heath and one fellfieId in N Sweden. Hence, our data suggest that the delta(15)N pattern: NON/AM plants > ECM plants greater than or equal to ERI plants is a general phenomenon in ecosystems with nutrient-deficient organogenic soils. In the fourth site, a birch forest with a lush herb/shrub understorey, the differences between functional groups were considerably smaller, and only the ERI species differed (by 1.1\%) from the NON species. Plants of all functional groups from this site had nearly twice the leaf N concentration as that found in the same species at the other three sites. It is likely that low inorganic N availability is a prerequisite for strong delta(15)N separation among functional groups. Both ECM roots and fruitbodies were N-15 enriched compared to leaves which suggests that the difference in delta(15)N between plants with different kinds of mycorrhiza could be due to isotopic fractionation at the fungal-plant interface. However, differences in delta(15)N between soil N forms absorbed by the plants could also contribute to the wide differences in plant delta(15)N found in most heath and forest tundra ecosystems. We hypothesize that during microbial immobilization of soil ammonium the microbial N pool could become N-15- depleted and the remaining, plant-available soil ammonium N-15-enriched. The latter could be a main source of N for NON/AM plants which usually have high delta(15)N. In contrast, amino acids and other soil organic N compounds presumably are N-15-depleted, similar to plant litter, and ECM and ERI plants with high uptake of these N forms hence have low leaf delta(15)N. Further indications come from the delta(15)N of mosses and lichens which was similar to that of ECM plants. Tundra cryptogams (and ECM and ERI plants) have previously been shown to have higher uptake of amino acid than ammonium N-, their low delta(15)N might therefore reflect the delta(15)N of free amino acids in the soil. The concentration of dissolved organic N was 3-16 times higher than that of inorganic N in the sites. Organic nitrogen could be an important N source for ECM and, in particular, ERI plants in heath and forest tundra ecosystems with low release rate of inorganic N from the soil organic matter.

AB  - Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has enhanced soil carbon (C) stocks in temperate forests. Most research has posited that these soil C gains are driven primarily by shifts in fungal community composition with elevated N leading to declines in lignin degrading Basidiomycetes. Recent research, however, suggests that plants and soil microbes are dynamically intertwined, whereby plants send C subsidies to rhizosphere microbes to enhance enzyme production and the mobilization of N. Thus, under elevated N, trees may reduce belowground C allocation leading to cascading impacts on the ability of microbes to degrade soil organic matter through a shift in microbial species and/or a change in plant–microbe interactions. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which couplings among plant, fungal, and bacterial responses to N fertilization alter the activity of enzymes that are the primary agents of soil decomposition. We measured fungal and bacterial community composition, root–microbial interactions, and extracellular enzyme activity in the rhizosphere, bulk, and organic horizon of soils sampled from a long-term (>25 years), whole-watershed, N fertilization experiment at the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA. We observed significant declines in plant C investment to fine root biomass (24.7%), root morphology, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization (55.9%). Moreover, we found that declines in extracellular enzyme activity were significantly correlated with a shift in bacterial community composition, but not fungal community composition. This bacterial community shift was also correlated with reduced AM fungal colonization indicating that declines in plant investment belowground drive the response of bacterial community structure and function to N fertilization. Collectively, we find that enzyme activity responses to N fertilization are not solely driven by fungi, but instead reflect a whole ecosystem response, whereby declines in the strength of belowground C investment to gain N cascade through the soil environment. {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Saprotrophic fungi are one of the primary groups of organisms responsible for decomposition and nutrient cycling processes. Aside from their direct effects on litter decomposition, these organisms may indirectly affect litter invertebrate activity via fungal-mediated conditioning (i.e. `priming') of litter substrates. While this priming effect is generally assumed to take place, this assumption is based on correlative observations and feeding preference trials rather than experimental discrimination of the mechanisms driving the process. We used a microcosm experiment of brown-rot (Fistulina hepatica, Fomitopsis lilacinogilva) and white-rot (Pycnoporus coccineus) fungi on two sclerophyllous leaf litters (Eucalyptus loxophleba and Acacia acuminata) to test if a fungal-mediated change in plant litter increased the nutritive value of the food source, and if a change in cell-wall (structural) compounds reduced the toughness of leaves, resulting in increased feeding activity by invertebrates. Brown- and white-rot fungal colonization had significant and diverse effects on the total nutrient concentrations and proportions of cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose of the leaf litter fungi complex. However, significant decreases in leaf toughness and increases in mass loss and leaf fragmentation associated with detritivorous millipede (Ommatoiulus moreletii) activity only occurred in white-rot primed microcosms relative to the control. The mechanisms by which the white-rot fungus affected both leaf toughness and millipede feeding activity differed between leaf litters. In E. loxophleba microcosms, reduced leaf toughness and increased millipede grazing were mediated by relative changes in litter inorganic chemistry, rather than structural compounds, whereas in A. acuminata microcosms the effects of fungal priming were not mediated by either. These results suggest that, in the early stages of decomposition, fungal priming effects on leaf litter nutrients are a more important determinant of litter invertebrate interactions than changes to litter structural compounds. Furthermore, different species of fungi interact with different litter types and invertebrates in functionally different ways. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) availability restricts plant carbon assimilation from the atmosphere in N-limited boreal ecosystems. Boreal forest floor is covered with ericoid plants and in soil, ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal plant roots and fungal hyphae are intermixed. How different mycorrhizal plants affect N mobilization from soil organic matter (SOM) has yet to be elucidated. Here we compared the effects of ericoid plants (Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis-idaea), forming ericoid mycorrhiza (ERM), on soil N chemistry, plant N uptake and SOM decomposition and compared them with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) Pinus sylvestris in a microcosm experiment. Pine and ericoid plants affected soil N similarly, accessing both degradable and recalcitrant N pools. Both ericoid plants and pine took up N from organic source. Ericoid plant roots contained more phenolic compounds and condensed tannins than pine roots which together with lower pH under ericoids suggests substantial changes in soil chemistry and biology. This study underlines the plant stimulation of SOM degradation with special emphasis on ericoid plants. We point out that both ericoid and ectomycorrhizal plants and their interactions should be of interest when N uptake and SOM decomposition in boreal forests are studied. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Epipogium aphyllum is a rare Eurasian achlorophyllous forest orchid known to associate with fungi that form ectomycorrhizas, while closely related orchids of warm humid climates depend on wood- or litter-decomposer fungi. We conducted 13C and 15N stable isotope natural abundance analyses to identify the organic nutrient source of E. aphyllum from Central Norway. These data for orchid shoot tissues, in comparison to accompanying autotrophic plants, document C and N flow from ectomycorrhizal fungi to the orchid. DNA data from fungal pelotons in the orchid root cortex confirm the presence of Inocybe and Hebeloma, which are both fungi that form ectomycorrhizas. The enrichment factors for 13C and 15N of E. aphyllum are used to calculate a new overall average enrichment factor for mycoheterotrophic plants living in association with ectomycorrhizal fungi ($\epsilon$13C±1SD of 7.2±1.6‰ and $\epsilon$15N±1SD of 12.8±3.9‰). These can be used to estimate the fungal contribution to organic nutrient uptake by partially mycoheterotrophic plants where fully mycoheterotrophic plants are lacking. N concentrations in orchid tissue were unusually high and significantly higher than in accompanying autotrophic leaf samples. This may be caused by N gain of E. aphyllum from obligate ectomycorrhizal fungi. We show that E. aphyllum is an epiparasitic mycoheterotrophic orchid that depends on ectomycorrhizal Inocybe and Hebeloma to obtain C and N through a tripartite system linking mycoheterotrophic plants through fungi with forest trees. {\textcopyright} 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.

AB  - The influence of litter quality on root growth, ectomycorrhizal communities and decay processes was investigated through a litter bag experiment. Litter bags containing either pine needles, oak leaves or oak+ pine mix were placed within the O horizon of a lowland pitch pine (Pinus rigida) forest in the New Jersey Pinelands. Upon retrieval, ingrown pine roots were removed and quantified for total length and percent ectomycorrhizal colonization by morphotype. Phosphatase activity was determined for dominant morphotypes. In addition, litter decay rates and N and P litter content were measured. Mixed litter (oaks pine) had highest total pine root ingrowth. Dominant ectomycorrhizal morphotypes differed in response to litter type. A tuberculate form dominated (35\%) in pine litters while distinctly different nontuberculate morphotypes dominated in oak and mixed litters. High phosphatase activity of morphotypes was correlated with high phosphorus immobilization during oak leaf decay. Results indicate that a mix of forest litters (oak and pine) optimizes retention of scarce nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The diverse chemical environment of these different litter types induces different ectomycorrhizal community development which show functional differences in the way phosphorus is likely to be cycled. The influence of litter type on diversity and function of ectomycorhizae is an important step in identifying linkages between biodiversity of this group and ecosystem functions.

AB  - Fast-growing plant species are plentiful at the early stages of succession and possess roots with greater capacity for soil exploration than slow-growing plant species of late stages. Thus, the dynamics of fine-root production, morphological traits and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) infection intensity were assessed monthly over 1 y in the grassland, scrub, secondary and mature forests of the Atlantic Forest ecosystem, amounting to 13 consecutive samplings. Fine roots were sampled in three 100 × 100-m plots at each study site. Each plot was subdivided in five 20 × 100-m subplots and 15 soil samples were randomly taken from a depth of 0-5 cm in soil within each plot. The average of the fine-root dry mass increased from 1.39 mg cm-3 soil in the grassland to 3.37 mg cm-3 in the secondary forest; fine-root tip diameter varied from 146 $\mu$m in the grassland to 303 $\mu$m in the mature forest; tissue density from 0.24 g cm-3 root in the grassland to 0.30 g cm-3 in the mature forest and fine-root length was 4.52 cm cm -3 soil in the grassland and 6.48 cm cm-3 soil in the secondary forest. On the other hand, fine-root specific length decreased from 43.9 m g-1 root to 18.3 m g-1 root in the mature forest; incidence of root hairs was 67% in the grassland and 30% in the mature forest; the length of root hairs was 215 $\mu$m in the grassland and 112 $\mu$m in the mature forest; and the intensity of AMF infection decreased from 66% in the grassland to 17% in the mature forest. In addition to AMF infection, the environmental variation also affected dry mass production and morphological traits of fine roots. During the cool season, fine-root dry mass, fine-root length, incidence and length of root hairs and intensity of AMF infection decreased compared with the warm season. We verified that the potential for soil exploration, that expresses the capacity for nutrient acquisition via fine roots and AMF infection intensity, decreased during the cool season and with the advance of the successional groups. These results indicate that fine-root traits and intensity of AMF infection are influenced by the intrinsic nutrient requirements of the plant species in each ecological group. {\textcopyright} 2014 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Atmospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition rates are predicted to drastically increase in the coming decades. The ecosystem level consequences of these increases will depend on how plant tissue nutrient concentrations, stoichiometry and investment in nutrient uptake mechanisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) change in response to increased nutrient availability, and how responses differ between plant functional types. Using a factorial nutrient addition experiment with seedlings of multiple N-fixing and non-N-fixing tree species, we examined whether leaf chemistry and AMF responses differ between these dominant woody plant functional groups of tropical savanna and dry forest ecosystems. We found that N-fixers have remarkably stable foliar chemistry that stays constant with external input of nutrients. Non-N-fixers responded to N and N + P addition by increasing both concentrations and total amounts of foliar N, but showed a corresponding decrease in P concentrations while total amounts of foliar P stayed constant, suggesting a ‘dilution' of tissue P with increased N availability. Non-N-fixers also showed an increase in N:P ratios with N and N + P addition, probably driven by both an increase in N and a decrease in P concentrations. AMF colonization decreased with N + P addition in non-N-fixers and increased with N and N + P addition in N-fixers, suggesting differences in their nutrient acquisition roles in the two plant functional groups. Our results suggest that N-fixers and non-N-fixers can differ significantly in their responses to N and P deposition, with potential consequences for future nutrient and carbon cycling in savanna and dry forest ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Fungal decomposition of and phosphorus transformation from spruce litter needles (Picea abies) were simulated in systems containing litter needles inoculated with individual saprotrophic fungal strains and their mixtures. Fungal strains of Setulipes androsaceus (L.) Anton{\'{i}}n, Chalara longipes (Preus) Cooke, Ceuthospora pinastri (Fr.) H{\"{o}}hn., Mollisia minutella (Sacc.) Rehm, Scleroconidioma sphagnicola Tsuneda, Currah & Thormann and an unknown strain NK11 were used as representatives of autochthonous mycoflora. Systems were incubated for 5.5 months in laboratory conditions. Fungal colonization in systems and competition among strains were assessed using the reisolation of fungi from individual needles. After incubation, needles were extracted with NaOH and extracts were analysed using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Needle decomposition was determined based on the decrease in C:N ratio. Systems inoculated with the basidiomycete S. androsaceus revealed substantial decrease in C:N ratio (from 25.8 to 11.3) while the effect of ascomycetes on the C:N ratio was negligible. We suppose that tested strains of saprotrophic ascomycetes did not participate substantially in litter decomposition, but were directly involved in phosphorus transformation and together with S. androsaceus could transform orthophosphate monoesters and diesters from spruce litter needles into diphosphates, polyphosphates and phosphonates. These transformations seem to be typical for saprotrophic fungi involved in litter needle decomposition, although the proportion of individual phosphorus forms differed among studied fungal strains. Phosphonate presence in needles after fungal inoculation is of special interest because no previous investigation recorded phosphonate synthesis and accumulation by fungi. Our results confirmed that the 31P NMR spectroscopy is an excellent instrumental method for studying transformations of soil organic phosphorus during plant litter decomposition. We suggest that polyphosphate production by S. androsaceus may contribute to the phosphorus cycle in forest ecosystems because this fungus is a frequent litter colonizer that substantially participates in decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We analyzed the dynamics of the short-term incorporation of recently fixed carbon into the below-ground food web in a boreal forest. Five young spruce trees (Picea abies) were pulse-labeled with 13CO2 and the isotopic label was traced in soil invertebrates during 5 weeks. The freshly fixed plant carbon quickly entered both litter-located and soil-located compartments of the detrital food web. Among invertebrates inhabiting the mineral soil layers, a trophic link to the root-derived C was most pronounced in species with higher $\delta$15N values, suggesting this energy source to be more important in deeper mineral soil horizons. The label appeared faster in saprophagous animals than in predators (the median time lag after labeling was 6 and 12 days, respectively), but the difference was not significant. The label was recovered in 15 of 38 species of saprophagous animals and in 20 of 63 species of predators. Among saprophages, the frequency and intensity of the label was relatively high in endogeic collembolans and in bibionid larvae, but earthworms and enchytraeids were not labeled. Several groups of predators, lithobiid centipedes in particular, quickly acquired the root-derived carbon, possibly indicating the feeding on live roots or mycorrhizal mycelium. In total, only 35 % of species or genera examined acquired the label. This suggests that majority of invertebrate taxa in the decomposer food web are unlikely to depend heavily on freshly fixed plant carbon provided by roots and root-associated microorganisms. {\textcopyright} 2016, The Ecological Society of Japan.

AB  - Forensic archaeologists and criminal investigators employ many different techniques for the location, recovery, and analysis of clandestine graves. Many of these techniques are based upon the premise that a grave is an anomaly and therefore differs physically, biologically, or chemically from its surroundings. The work reviewed in this communication demonstrates how and why field mycology might provide a further tool towards the investigation of scenes of crime concealed in forest ecosystems. The fruiting structures of certain fungi, the ammonia and the postputrefaction fungi, have been recorded repeatedly in association with decomposed mammalian cadavers in disparate regions of the world. The ecology and physiology of these fungi are reviewed briefly with a view to their potential as a forensic tool. This application of mycology is at an interface with forensic archaeology and forensic taphonomy and may provide a means to detect graves and has the potential to estimate postburial interval.

AB  - Organic matter decomposition is the main process by which carbon (C) is lost from terrestrial ecosystems, and mycorrhizal associations of plants (i.e. arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) and ectomycorrhizas (ECM)) may have different indirect effects on this loss pathway. AM and ECM plants differ in the soil decomposers they promote and the quality of litter they produce, which may result in different patterns of organic matter decomposition, and hence, soil C loss. To determine how mycorrhizal associations indirectly affect decomposer activity, we collected soils and litters from four AM and four ECM tree species from a mixed-deciduous temperate forest for a field and laboratory study. We first characterized insitu patterns in soil chemistry and soil microbial biomass among these eight tree species. We then conducted a microcosm experiment with mineral soils, leaf litter and fine roots originating from these tree species, where we reciprocally crossed litters and soils, and quantified the rate of heterotrophic respiration over a 140-day laboratory incubation. In natural forest conditions, AM tree soils contained lower total C and microbial biomass C:N relative to ECM tree soils. In our microcosm experiment, AM soils supported greater heterotrophic respiration than did ECM soils. The addition of AM litter stimulated respiration more than did ECM litter, owing to the lower C:N of AM litter. Matching the mycorrhizal identity of litter and soil resulted in a difference in total respiration, such that combinations of AM litters with AM soils lost more C than did combinations of ECM litters with ECM soils.Synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that AM and ECM trees have differing indirect effects on soil decomposer activity through the decomposers they cultivate and/or the quality of organic matter they produce. Mycorrhizal differences in litter quality accentuate these effects on soil C loss and may explain patterns in soil C dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Edible forest mushrooms are one of the most important non-wood products and their economic importance is constantly growing. Only in Poland, the value of collected mushroom is estimated to about 740 million PLN a year. Such species as Boletus sp., Lactarius sp. or Tuber sp. are the most valuable non-wood forest products. Wild species, a great part of which are ectomycorrhizal fungi, not only play a key role in the growth and development of forest trees, but also belong to the most used in the Polish cuisine. A new challenge is to develop a scientific basis for the production of edible ectomycorrhizal fungi. Given the fact that fructification of fungi is influenced by many environmental, ecological, orographic and anthropogenic factors, their growing is rather a tough task. So far, methods of fungi growing have been developed in case of several species and they are still to be implemented on an economic scale. Under natural conditions, both mycorrhizal and fruiting processes may be stimulated by proper silviculture treatments, which are conducive to wood and mushrooms production as well. Nowadays, the concept of `mycosilviculture' is gaining more and more interest. In order to implement it, the knowledge of the biology of fungi and their host-species is needed. In this article, a rich body of studies dealing with the influence of management methods on fruitification of fungi is reviewed. The critical factor that appears is the proper regulation of tree density by appropriate severity of thinnings and regeneration cuts in order to meet the requirements of targeted fungi. The other kinds of treatments, such as removal of the herb cover, litter and upper soil level also affect fungi fructification. The effect of these treatments may vary for different species. The knowledge of wild mushroom production, forest management and climate changes still requires long-term and multidimensional research in a broad spectrum of tree stands and forest habitats.

AB  - Dalbergia sissoo, an important tree of tropical regions, is grown as monoculture or in agroforesty systems because of the quality of its wood and its effects on soil fertility through N2 fixation. Low soil fertility in tropical regions results in poor plant growth. This is significant in the case of forest trees, since they are generally transplanted without considering the fertility status of soil. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (a plant-growth promoting fungus through higher nutrient uptake), Rhizobium leguminosarum strain DSP2 (a N2 fixer) and Pseudomonas fluorescens strain GRPr (a plant-growth promoting bacterium), on the growth and nutrient acquisition of Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. Mollisol and Entisol were used to compare the effects of different soils. A tetrapartite interaction of AMF, P. fluorescens strain GRPr, R. leguminosarum strain DSP2 and D. sissoo showed improved plant growth response in the Entisol compared to uninoculated plants. The interaction of AMF with DSP2 was found; however, AMF did not show the same growth responses in combination with either GRPr or DSP2 and GRPr regardless of soil type. AMF and GRPr showed decreased plant growth, suggesting that enhanced plant growth was dependent on the bacteria - AMF combination used. We suggest that, in the case of D. sissoo, choice and testing of the combination of beneficial organisms is necessary to get desired plant growth promotion. {\textcopyright} International Society for Tropical Ecology.

AB  - Restoration ecology is the study of renewing a degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystem through active human intervention. Restoration ecology specifically refers to the scientific study that has evolved as recently. It assumes that environmental degradation and population decline are somewhat reversible processes. Ecological restoration has the potential to improve air quality, reverse forest clearance and desertification, slow biodiversity loss, enhance urban environments, and perhaps improve human livelihoods, and humanity's relationships within nature. Recent conceptual advances highlight the interactions between flora, fauna, and soil in restoration ecology. The recovery process is relatively longer in comparison to the time taken for degradation. Restoration might take place naturally but that is a very slow process. Restoration ecology initiates and speeds up the recovery process. Bioremediation is the use of organisms (prokaryotes, fungi, plant, etc.) to detoxify polluted ecosystems by accumulating the toxic components in their bodies. Microbes may play a vital role in supplying nutrients in utilizable forms from soil to the plants. The important functions of the microbes are in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, and plant growth hormone synthesis, which are essential for better colonization of mangroves, etc. Recognizing the importance of soil microbes for success of higher plants and overall ecosystem health is the key to success of restoration. Plants with nitrogen-fixing symbioses have been employed throughout the history of restoration. Mycorrhizal associations have also been long explored in restoration settings, where their benefits have been repeatedly demonstrated, although the necessity of active mycorrhizal introduction is still required. Soil microbes help in mineralization of organic substrates form litter and release nutrients as a result of the heterotrophic activity. Hence, the microbial biomass is an important factor for maintaining soil quality, nutrient cycling, and soil reclamation. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although replanting broad-leaved trees in coniferous forest has been proven to increase stand soil quality, it is unclear how this prevalent forest management regime affects the soil fungal communities of individual conifers in mixed forest. Herein, we chose two representative coniferous tree species (Pinus massoniana and Pinus elliottii) and employed high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR to investigate fungal community composition and function in rhizosphere soils under monoculture and in mixed forests (replanted with Schima superba for 13 years) in subtropical China. Mixing with broad-leaved trees resulted in increased rhizosphere soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient (total nitrogen, NH4+ and available phosphorus). Rhizosphere soil fungal abundance (ITS gene copy numbers) and community diversity of conifers were increased after mixing. Meanwhile, the soil fungal abundance and ACE richness index in Masson pine were higher compared with slash pine whether in monoculture or mixed forests. Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota and Glomeromycota were the dominant phyla in soils. Mixing with broad-leaved trees decreased the relative abundance of Ascomycota, while it increased Basidiomycota and Glomeromycota in the rhizosphere soil of conifers. Moreover, there was a decrease in the relative abundance of animal pathogens and wood saprotrophic fungi, while soil saprotrophic fungi, ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were increased in rhizosphere soil of conifers after mixing, suggesting changes from saprotrophic fungi to symbiotrophic fungi to increase soil nutrient supply and enhance tree nutrient uptake. Principal coordinates analysis showed that the fungal communities in mixed forests clustered closely and were separated from monoculture forests. Fungal community composition and function were mainly dependent on SOC. Our results indicate that mixing with broad-leaved trees increases fungal abundance, alters fungal community composition and function and thus potentially contributes to soil quality improvement and tree nutrient acquisition of conifers. Masson pine is more adaptable than slash pine to establish mixed forest in subtropical China. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi exhibit high diversity even in small monoculture forests. Roughly 20 to 35 species typically occupy such sites. Explanations for this diversity can be based on resource partitioning, disturbance, competition, or interaction with other organisms. Mycorrhizal fungi compete for two general classes of resources: host-derived carbon and soil or detritus derived mineral nutrients. Both types of resources are arrayed in space (e.g., soil depth, distance from tree) and time (e.g., season, host successional series). Some species seem to be partitioned in space and time at these scales, but the question of how widespread these patterns are remains largely unanswered. Mineral resources are distributed in discrete substrates in soil, litter, and within other soil microorganisms; the biochemical diversity exhibited by fungi may translate into differences in access to these resources among species. Small-scale natural disturbances that sever roots, mix soil horizons and litter layers, or change local pH and nutrient availability, are likely to create additional habitats for ectomycorrhizal fungi. Evidence from fruiting patterns and differences in colonization strategies suggest that such disturbances may be important for establishment of some species. Competitive replacement networks among species have the theoretical potential to increase diversity. The frequency of species replacements, observed co-infections of ectomycorrhizal fungi on single host roots, and high rates of rootlet turn-over all suggest that competition is important, but whether it plays a creative role in maintaining diversity remains to be demonstrated. Other organisms could be important in the maintenance of diversity, if they effect competition among mycorrhizal fungi. Bacteria and soil invertebrates are the most likely groups for such interactions. Technological advances in root observation and PCR methods for indentification of mycorrhizae make many of these theories testable. {\textcopyright} 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Since 2013 there have been 22 new species of Laccaria described worldwide. Only three of these represent species from the neotropics. In Panama, Laccaria is abundant in monodominant Oreomunnea mexicana (Juglandaceae) forests based on sporocarps and environmental sequencing of roots. This study uses a combination of morphological and phylogenetic evidence to document up to seven species of Laccaria from these forests, one previously described, three described as new, and three requiring more data before being formally described. Molecular data used for phylogenetic analysis include the nuclear ribosomal ITS and 28S regions, along with TEF1 and RPB2. Laccaria stellata, has previously been reported from O. mexicana cloud forests of Panama. Laccaria dallingii sp. nov., L. nitrophila sp. nov., and L. fortunensis sp. nov. are described as new based on morphology and phylogenetic analysis of multiple collections. A taxon referred to as “PAN sp3” is resolved sister to L. stellata. Phylogenetic analysis also resolved two separate clades of Panamanian Laccaria as sister to L. roseoalbescens, a species previously described from Mexico. These three taxa are not described in this paper as there is too little material from which to make effective morphological descriptions even though their placement in phylogenetic analysis identify them as being unique. Ecologically, all described species except for L. fortunensis were amplified from O. mexicana ectomycorrhizal root tips. L. nitrophila was one of the most recovered species from the roots of O. mexicana in a previous study, and it has been shown to respond positively to long term nitrogen addition. Our results expand the knowledge of Laccaria diversity for Central America and highlight that at least some species of Laccaria are nitrophilic in neotropical Juglandaceae forests as well as in temperate forests. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020 Corrales, Wilson, Mueller and Ovrebo.

AB  - 1. Fine root turnover plays a critical role in carbon and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. In this study, we focused on the most abundant deciduous species in Nordic countries, silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and its fine root dynamics, including the amount of litter produced by fine roots as well as by aboveground vegetation. 2. The minirhizotron method was used to quantify fine root longevity of silver birch and understory fine roots and rhizomes in northern Finland. Fine root biomass per basal area and ectomycorrhizal short root numbers per mg were also quantified. The fine root litter production was estimated by fine root biomass and longevity, and then compared with the aboveground litter collected with litter traps. 3. Birch fine root biomass was 1.4-fold higher than that of understory fine roots and rhizomes (234 ± 22, 171 ± 19 g m−2 respectively). Fine root longevity of birch (372 days) was significantly (P < 0.05) shorter than that of understory vegetation (643 days). The birch fine root longevity was positively related to root diameter and soil depth. Hazard analysis showed that thicker roots, long roots, roots produced late in the growing season, and roots growing deeper in the soil had relatively lower mortality hazard compared to the reference data. The total annual soil C input, including both birch and understory, was 283 g C m−2 yr−1. The proportion of understory annual C input was 35% of the total. Total annual belowground C input was 1.4-fold greater than that of aboveground. 4. Our study indicated that the total annual belowground litter production was greater than that of the aboveground litter in a boreal deciduous forest stand. Therefore, more emphasis should be put to quantify the C cycling of both above- and belowground parts of different tree species as well as understory in boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The inhibitory principles of aqueous extracts of aspen leaves, acting upon mycorrhizal fungi of forest trees, were isolated by extraction with ethyl acetate and chromatography on silicic acid. Two inhibitors were identified as benzoic acid and catechol by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. When added to a synthetic medium, these substances had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of different Boletus‐species and a weaker inhibitory effect on litter‐decomposing Marasmius‐species. When the fraction of the extract which was not soluble in ethyl acetate was included in the medium, the aromatic compounds still inhibited the mycorrhizal fungi while the growth of the litter‐decomposers was stimulated.

AB  - Fungi are crucial to forest ecosystem function and provide important provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services. As major contributors to biomass decomposition, fungi are important to forest bio-geochemical cycling and maintenance of vertebrate animal diversity. Many forest plant species live in a symbiotic relationship with a fungal partner that helps a host plant to acquire nutrients and water. In addition, edible fungi are recreationally as well as economically valuable. However, most fungi live in very cryptic locations (e.g. in soils and interior plant tissues) and are only visible when their ephemeral fruiting bodies are produced, making fungal occurrence difficult to detect and predict. While remote sensing has been used increasingly to identify and scale many forest characteristics (e.g. structure, function, and species diversity) related to myriad ecosystem services, the use of remotely sensed data in modelling the occurrence of fungi is largely unknown. We compared the performance of airborne lidar derived structural variables, including those associated with single tree detection, with variables derived from field inventories to model overall fungal species abundance as well as specific fungal guilds (i.e. a range of edibility from highly edible to very poisonous, and the number of fruiting bodies of saprotrophic and mutualistic ectomycorrhizal species) based on fruiting body sampling in a low range mountain forest (Bavarian Forest National Park). Lidar derived variables performed better than variables derived from field measurements to explain the abundance of all guilds combined, as well as the guilds of soil saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi, and the yield of highly edible fungi. Variables derived from field measurements performed better than lidar derived variables in explaining the yield of very poisonous fungi. Upscaling of yield and abundance of fruiting bodies to the whole study area opens the avenue for managers to identify areas of high interest by mushroom pickers, as opposed to those of potential danger to people and those that co-occur with sensitive species and habitats of conservation relevance. Moreover, the strong, guild-specific relationships found between the occurrence of fungi and lidar derived variables opens new avenues for scaling to large areas the occurrence of members of this cryptic kingdom.

AB  - Ecosystem-level consequences of biodiversity loss of macroorganisms are well understood, while the repercussions of species extirpation in microbial systems are not. We manipulated species richness and phylogenetic relatedness of saprotrophic fungi in situ in a boreal forest to address this issue. Litter decomposition rates (as total mass loss) after 2 months were significantly higher in the least phylogenetically related fungal assemblages. Likewise, cellulose loss was also highest in the most distantly related treatments after 1 year. There were marginal effects of species richness on mass loss that only affected decomposition after 2 months. At the end of 1 year of decomposition, most fungal communities had collapsed from their original diversity to two species, mainly in the Penicillium or Hypocrea clades. Two concurrent processes may explain these results: competition between closely related fungal taxa and phylogenetic conservation in cellulose decomposition. Our results suggest that phylogenetic relatedness of fungal communities may be a more appropriate metric than species richness or community composition to predict functional responses of fungal communities to global change. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Grassland afforestation with coniferous trees, occurring in many parts of the world, can greatly affect the nature and transformation of soil organic matter and associated nutrients, including phosphorus (P). This review critically examines the shifts in soil P availability and chemical nature, microbial properties and soil quality, and possible mechanisms involved in the changes in P nature and transformation as a result of grassland afforestation, based on the published and unpublished data from investigations carried out in recent years. Grassland afforestation with coniferous trees is found to enhance mineralization of organic matter and associated P and consequently improve P availability in topsoil. This is attributed to a combination of factors including the greater P demand and uptake by trees, the improved solubility of organic P by root and microbial exudates (e.g. low molecular weight organic acids), greater tree root phosphatase activity associated with ectomycorrhizae, and favourable soil moisture and temperature conditions. In addition, grassland afforestation also modifies the chemical nature of soil organic P, with a decrease of inositol phosphates (including myo- and scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate) in soil under forest compared with grassland. On the other hand, grassland afforestation leads to lower soil microbial biomass carbon (C) and P, soil respiration and phosphatase activity, indicating a decrease in soil biological fertility. This may be associated with lower and less labile organic inputs into the mineral soil under coniferous forest compared with grassland and other chemical changes (e.g. lower soil pH) due to grassland afforestation. Future studies should focus on quantifying root and leaf litter inputs and turnover, characterization of the source, chemical composition and role of organic acids in the solubilization and hydrolysis of organic P using isotopic tracing and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, assessment of shifts in the composition, activity and function of the soil microbial biomass in relation to grassland afforestation using appropriate molecular techniques, and comparative study on particular roles of different mycorrhizae-root associations on the utilization of organic P in the soil environment.

AB  - Fine roots (<= 2 mm in diameter) of tree species, traditionally regarded as homogenous entities, are expected to be major contributors of forest soil organic carbon (C), but their contributions need to be reevaluated given the heterogeneity in many root characteristics within fine-root architecture. Here, literature data were synthesized to analyze whether there existed heterogeneity of decomposition rates within fine-root architecture of tree species and quantify the relative contributions of roots of each branching order to forest soil C storage by combining variations in annual litter inputs among fine-root branching hierarchies. Results showed the presence of heterogeneity in decomposition rates within fine-root architecture, and this pattern was influenced by classification methods (root order or diameter class). Specifically, the heterogeneity in decomposition rates was shown only when fine roots were classified by root order, but not when fine roots were classified by diameter class. The slower decomposition rates of lower-order roots (the first two orders) were related to their higher acid-unhydrolyzable residues. Furthermore, lower-order roots were found to account for 57-71\% of annual root litter inputs of the first five orders. Given the slow decomposition rates and high annual litter inputs of lower-order roots of tree species, our findings suggest that lower-order roots should be important contributors to forest soil organic C.

AB  - An igap{\'{o}} forest near the confluence of Rio Tarum{\~{a}} Mirim (Tarum{\~{a}}zinho) and Rio Negro has been studied. It is a typical ectotroph forest with a raw humus layer and suppressed litter decomposing activity by Higher (i.e., carpophore-producing) Fungi. The number of the latter is about one-fifth of that observed in the (anectotrophic) terra firme forest. All ectotrophically mycorrhizal fungi observed belonged in three families:Amanitaceae, Boletaceae, Russulaceae. Leguminosae are dominant, and of these Aldina latifolia and Swartzia cf. polyphylla were demonstrably ectomycorrhizal. The scarcity of mineral nutrients in the soils of igap{\'{o}}, campinarana and campina is overcome by direct cycling through ectomycorrhizae. This is in contrast to other black- and white-water inundated forest communities in Amazonia. {\textcopyright} 1986 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Mycorrhizal fungi transfer nutrients to plants in exchange for photosynthates. Plants allocate up to 20% of their carbon to mycorrhizal structures, mycelium and fruit bodies of their fungal partners. Individuals of mycorrhizal fungi may encompass hundreds of square metres of soil and defragmented litter, linking multiple plant individuals of different species and size (Figure 1). Using a free-air 13CO2 enrichment (web-FACE) technique in a mature forest, interspecific transfer accounted for 40% of fine root carbon after 5 years of back and forth transfer between trees. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Rog, Rosenstock, K{\"{o}}rner, and Klein (2020) show that closely related trees shared relatively more mycorrhizal fungi than distantly related trees in the same experimental site, which correlated to increased carbon sharing. {\textcopyright} 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Dominance of primary rain forests by the ectomycorrhizal, leguminous canopy tree Dicymbe corymbosa (Caesalpiniaceae) was investigated in the Pakaraima Mountains of western Guyana. In five 1-ha forest inventory plots in the Upper Ireng and Upper Potaro River drainages basal areas of D. corymbosa ranged from 38.4-52.8 m(2) ha(-1) (63-85\% of total) among all trees greater than or equal to10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh), values in the upper range for tropical moist forests worldwide. The high basal areas for D. corymbosa were due to the prevalence of large (>150 cm dbh), multi-stemmed individuals. Stem densities in Dicymbe plots ranged from 276-433 ha(-1), with D. corymbosa contributing 24.6-59.8\%. In three 1-ha mixed forest plots adjacent to the Dicymbe plots, D. corymbosa was absent. In the mixed forests, stem densities were higher (480-585 ha(-1)), basal areas were lower (36.7-39.8 m(2) ha(-1)), species diversity was higher, and canopy tree species were more equitably distributed than in the Dicymbe plots. Tree community composition was not qualitatively different between Dicymbe and mixed forests. In the Dicymbe plots, mean sapling and seedling densities of D. corymbosa were significantly higher than most other canopy species, indicating persistent monodominance. Edaphic variation did not account for variation in forest composition. Life history traits are discussed which may contribute to clumping in D. corymbosa, including coppicing and mast-fruiting, and the potential role of litter-trapping physiognomy and ectomycorrhiza-mediated nutrient dynamics in promoting monodominance is noted.

AB  - Ecosystem carbon (C) balance is hypothesised to be sensitive to the mycorrhizal strategies that plants use to acquire nutrients. To test this idea, we coupled an optimality-based plant nitrogen (N) acquisition model with a microbe-focused soil organic matter (SOM) model. The model accurately predicted rhizosphere processes and C–N dynamics across a gradient of stands varying in their relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees. When mycorrhizal dominance was switched – ECM trees dominating plots previously occupied by AM trees, and vice versa – legacy effects were apparent, with consequences for both C and N stocks in soil. Under elevated productivity, ECM trees enhanced decomposition more than AM trees via microbial priming of unprotected SOM. Collectively, our results show that ecosystem responses to global change may hinge on the balance between rhizosphere priming and SOM protection, and highlight the importance of dynamically linking plants and microbes in terrestrial biosphere models. {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS

AB  - Plants produce above- and below-ground biomass. However, our understanding of both production and decomposition of below-ground biomass is poor, largely because of the difficulties of accessing roots. Below-ground organic matter decomposition studies are scant and especially rare in the tropics. In this study, we used a litter bag experiment to quantify the mass loss and nutrient dynamics of decomposing twigs and small roots from an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal associated tree, Parashorea chinensis Wang Hsie, in a tropical rain forest in Southwest China. Overall, twig litter decomposed 1.9 times faster than small roots (decay rate (k) twig = 0.255, root = 0.134). The difference in decomposition rates can be explained by a difference in phosphorus (P) concentration, availability, and use by decomposers or carbon quality. Twigs and small roots showed an increase in nitrogen concentration, with final concentrations still higher than initial levels. This suggests nitrogen transfer from the surrounding environment into decomposing twigs and small roots. Both carbon and nitrogen dynamics were significantly predicted by mass loss and showed a negative and positive relationship, respectively. Our study results imply that small roots carbon and nitrogen increase the resident time in the soil. Therefore, a better understanding of the carbon cycle requires a better understanding of the mechanisms governing below-ground biomass decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Invasive species may leave behind legacies that persist even after removal, inhibiting subsequent restoration efforts. We examined the soil legacy of Cytisus scoparius, a nitrogen-fixing, putatively allelopathic shrub invading the western US. We tested the hypothesis that allelopathy plays a critical role in the depressive effect of Cytisus on the key native Douglas-fir, both directly on tree growth and indirectly via effects on its ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF). In a greenhouse factorial experiment, we used activated carbon to inhibit Cytisus-produced allelochemicals and sucrose to reduce elevated nitrogen (N). We found that: (1) Cytisus-invaded soils depressed Douglas-fir growth compared to uninvaded forest soils. The effect of adding Cytisus litter was positive (possibly reflecting an N fertilization effect) only in the presence of activated carbon, providing evidence for a role of allelopathic compounds. Activated carbon did not increase growth in the absence of Cytisus litter. Finally, sucrose addition provided weak support for a nitrogen effect of Cytisus litter. (2) Seedlings grown in Cytisus soils had lower EMF abundance compared to those in uninvaded forest soils. In forest soil from one site, adding Cytisus litter also decreased EMF abundance. Douglas-fir growth increased significantly with EMF across sites and soils suggesting that changes in EMF were linked to tree growth. The fungal taxon Cenococcum geophilum was significantly depressed in Cytisus soils compared to forest soils, while Rhizopogon rogersii abundance was similar across soil types. These results together suggest an overall negative effect of Cytisus on the growth of a dominant native tree and its fungal symbionts. Our study suggests how the role of allelopathy in ecological restoration may play out on two time scales: through immediate, direct impacts on native plants as well as through long-term, persistent impacts mediated by the collapse or transformation of microbial communities. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Basidiomycetes are the major agents of decomposition and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems, occurring as both saprotrophs and mycorrhizal symbionts (Boddy & Watkinson, 1995; Smith & Read, 1997). The mycelium can scavenge and sequester nutrients from soil, concentrate nutrients from decomposing organic matter, relocate nutrients between different organic resources, and ultimately make nutrients available to plants to maintain primary productivity. Hyphae of both saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes that ramify through soil often aggregate to form rapidly extending, persistent, specialized high-conductivity channels termed cords (Rayner italic., 1994, 1999; Boddy, 1999; Watkinson, 1999; Cairney, 2005). These cords form complex networks that can extend for metres or hectares in the natural environment. The distribution of resources is extremely heterogeneous and unpredictable in space and time, and these fungi have developed species-specific strategies to search for new resources and to capitalize on resources landing on their mycelial systems (Chapter 6, this volume). Thus the architecture of the network is not static, but is continuously reconfigured in response to local nutritional or environmental cues, damage or predation, through a combination of growth, branching, fusion or regression (Boddy, 1999; Watkinson, 1999; Chapter 6, this volume). At this stage it is not clear whether specific global mechanisms exist to couple local sensory perception and responses over different length scales specifically to maximize the long-term success of the whole colony, or whether such collective behaviour is an emergent property arising solely from local interactions of individual hyphae. {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.

AB  - Accurate projections of the future land carbon (C) sink by terrestrial biosphere models depend on how nutrient constraints on net primary production are represented. While nutrient limitation is nearly universal, current models do not have a C cost for plant nutrient acquisition. Also missing are symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi, which can consume up to 20% of net primary production and supply up to 50% of a plant's nitrogen (N) uptake. Here we integrate simultaneous uptake and mycorrhizae into a cutting-edge plant N model - Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN) - that can be coupled into terrestrial biosphere models. The C cost of N acquisition varies as a function of mycorrhizal type, with plants that support arbuscular mycorrhizae benefiting when N is relatively abundant and plants that support ectomycorrhizae benefiting when N is strongly limiting. Across six temperate forested sites (representing arbuscular mycorrhizal- and ectomycorrhizal-dominated stands and 176 site years), including multipath resistance improved the partitioning of N uptake between aboveground and belowground sources. Integrating mycorrhizae led to further improvements in predictions of N uptake from soil (R2 = 0.69 increased to R2 = 0.96) and from senescing leaves (R2 = 0.29 increased to R2 = 0.73) relative to the original model. On average, 5% and 9% of net primary production in arbuscular mycorrhizal- and ectomycorrhizal-dominated forests, respectively, was needed to support mycorrhizal-mediated acquisition of N. To the extent that resource constraints to net primary production are governed by similar trade-offs across all terrestrial ecosystems, integrating these improvements to FUN into terrestrial biosphere models should enhance predictions of the future land C sink. {\textcopyright}2014.

AB  - In a previous study, we demonstrated that Suillus granulatus exhibits positive growth responses to added litter. From this, we hypothesized that this positive growth response (increased number of EM root tips) would be accompanied by increased activities of enzymes that enable EM fungi to utilize litter as a nutrient source. We tested this hypothesis by adding sterile litter in replicate treatment/control blocks, and assaying cellulase, laccase and phosphatase activities in the dominant fungal species, S. granulatus. We used healthy, growing EM roots for both treatment and control assays. Activities of all enzymes increased significantly in response to litter addition (P < 0.05 laccase; P < 0.01 cellulase; P < 0.001 phosphatase). Hence, litter accumulation apparently causes functional as well as structural changes to the EM fungal community that would significantly affect carbon cycling in forest ecosystems.

AB  - The American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was once an integral part of eastern United States deciduous forests, with many environmental, economic, and social values. This ended with the introduction of an invasive fungal pathogen that wiped out over three billion trees. Transgenic American chestnuts expressing a gene for oxalate oxidase successfully tolerate infections by this blight fungus, but potential non-target environmental effects should be evaluated before new restoration material is released. Two greenhouse bioassays evaluated belowground interactions between transgenic American chestnuts and neighboring organisms found in their native ecosystems. Potential allelopathy was tested by germinating several types of seeds, all native to American chestnut habitats, in the presence of chestnut leaf litter. Germination was not significantly different in terms of number of seeds germinated or total biomass of germinated seedlings in transgenic and non-transgenic leaf litter. Separately, ectomycorrhizal associations were observed on transgenic and non-transgenic American chestnut roots using field soil inoculum. Root tip colonization was consistently high (>90% colonization) on all plants and not significantly different between any tree types. These observations on mycorrhizal fungi complement previous studies performed on older transgenic lines which expressed oxalate oxidase at lower levels. Along with other environmental impact comparisons, these conclusions provide further evidence that transgenic American chestnuts are not functionally different with regard to ecosystem interactions than non-transgenic American chestnuts. {\textcopyright} 2018 Newhouse, Oakes, Pilkey, Roden, Horton and Powell.

AB  - We studies the seasonal dynamics of phenolics in leaves, litter and soil of the dominant host tree oak (Quercus robur L.) growing with ectomycorrhizal fungi truffles (T. macrosporum) in oak forest (Fraxino angustifoliae-Quercetum roboris Jov. et Tomi{\'{c}} 1979) near River Danube, near Belgrade. In litter, the highest content of free phenolics was in April (primordial growth period of truffles) and bound phenolics in August (truffles ripening- start of harvest). Due to intensive decomposition of forest litter during the vegetative growth period, free phenolic acids increased and the bound phenolic acids decreased. There was reduction in ratio of bound cinnamic to benzoic acids, it indicated the microbial degradation of lignin and the transformation of cinnamic derivatives into benzoic acid derivatives. In the top soil layer, where the majority of truffle fruit bodies were found (28.31 kg/ha/year), the free phenolics (direct influence on truffle growth and development) contents were up to 58.36 $\mu$g/g. As the mycelia and fruit bodies of truffle grow in phenolic-rich forest soil, hence, we assumed that the truffle is well-adapted to high phenolics content. {\textcopyright} 2015, International Allelopathy Foundation.

AB  - Massive moth outbreaks cause large-scale damage in subarctic mountain birch forests with a concomitant decrease in carbon flux to mycorrhizal fungi and an increased deposition of dissolved carbon and nutrients as moth frass into soil. We investigated impacts of moth herbivory along three replicated gradients with three levels of moth herbivory (undamaged, once damaged, repeatedly damaged) on soil nutrient levels and biological parameters. We found an increase in soil nutrients and in the biomass of enchytraeid worms, which are key faunal decomposers. Fungi : bacteria ratio and C:N ratio decreased in humus with increasing severity of herbivory. Our findings suggest enhanced resource turnover in mountain birch forests due to massive moth herbivory. This may provide a shortcut for carbon and nutrient input to subarctic soils, which largely bypasses the main routes of carbon from plants to soil via mycorrhizal and litter-decomposing fungi. Moreover, a temporal shift occurs in carbon allocation to soil, providing decomposers an opportunity to use an earlyseason peak in resource availability. Our results suggest a hitherto unappreciated role of massive insect herbivore attacks on resource dynamics in subarctic ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Spore characteristics of wood-inhabiting fungi suggest that wind is their predominant dispersal vector. However, since they are restricted to ephemeral habitats, colonizing new patches should benefit from dispersal by animals with similar habitat preferences because the directed, resource-searching movement of animals increases the likelihood of reaching suitable habitats. Here we determine which fungal guilds are carried by wood-inhabiting beetles and what influences beetle-associated fungal communities. High-throughput sequencing identified >1800 fungal taxa from beetle communities that emerged from 64 experimental logs. Beetle-associated fungi included mutualistic, decomposing, pathogenic and mycorrhizal fungi; decomposers were the most diverse. Partial-procrustes analysis revealed that the total beetle-associated community and mutualists were correlated (p <= 0.05) with beetle community composition and decomposers were marginally correlated (p <= 0.10) with beetle community composition. All three groups were marginally correlated with the total fungal communities that inhabit the dead wood. Our results show that beetles carry a broad range of wood-inhabiting fungi and beetle-associated fungal communities are determined by environmental factors and the vectoring beetle community and to some degree by the fungal source community. This suggests that wood-inhabiting beetles contribute to fungal dispersal, including directed dispersal, which could affect fungal community assembly and ecosystem processes like wood decomposition.

AB  - The presence of living roots can markedly change soil properties, microbial activities, and biogeochemical cycling in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil. Such rhizosphere effect has been increasingly recognized to play a crucial role in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we investigated the rhizosphere effects of 12 tree species associated with two contrasting mycorrhizal types (arbuscular mycorrhizal, AM vs. ectomycorrhizal, ECM) and co-occurring in a temperate secondary forest in Northeast China. The adhering soil method was adopted to sample paired rhizosphere and bulk soils of field-grown trees in the peak growing season. Generally, we found positive rhizosphere effects on soil properties (ammonium and nitrate content, total C and N content, and C:N ratio), microbial abundances (bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes), enzyme activities (C- and N-degradation enzymes), and C mineralization rate (Cmin), but minor rhizosphere effects on soil pH, phosphorus content and phosphatase activity, net N mineralization rate (Nmin), and specific Cmin and Nmin (per unit soil C or N). Because of large intraspecific and particularly interspecific variations, less than half of the rhizosphere effects were statistically significant (P < 0.05), and none of the rhizosphere effects differed significantly between the two mycorrhizal types (AM vs. ECM). Moreover, most soil variables varied greatly within and across species, and thus did not differ significantly between the two mycorrhizal types (AM vs. ECM). However, soil pH, nitrate content, microbial abundance, and C-degradation enzyme activity were notably lower under ECM species than under AM species. Collectively, these results show that rhizosphere effects varied greatly among the six species within both mycorrhizal groups, and such variations within mycorrhizal group were even larger than those between mycorrhizal group. Future work should include a larger number of tree species to increase statistical power, and combine phylogenic history and functional traits of plant species with the type and traits of mycorrhizal fungi to better understand how plant-microbe interactions influence biogeochemical cycling in the rhizosphere. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The widespread use of forest litter as animal bedding in central Europe for many centuries gave rise to the first litter manipulation studies, and their results demonstrated that litter and its decomposition are a vital part of ecosystem function. Litter plays two major roles in forest ecosystems: firstly, litterfall is an inherent part of nutrient and carbon cycling, and secondly, litter forms a protective layer on the soil surface that also regulates microclimatic conditions. By reviewing 152 years of litter manipulation experiments, I show that the effects of manipulating litter stem from changes in one, or both, of these two functions, and interactions between the variables influenced by the accumulation of litter can result in feedback mechanisms that may intensify treatment effects or mask responses, making the interpretation of results difficult. Long-term litter removal increased soil bulk density, overland flow, erosion, and temperature fluctuations and upset the soil water balance, causing lower soil water content during dry periods. Soil pH increased or decreased in response to manipulation treatments depending on forest type and initial soil pH, but it is unclear why there was no uniform response. Long-term litter harvesting severely depleted the forests of nutrients. Decreases in the concentrations of available P, Ca, Mg, and K in the soil occurred after only three to five years. The decline in soil N occurred over longer periods of time, and the relative loss was greater in soils with high initial nitrogen concentration. Tree growth declined with long-term litter removal, probably due to lower nutrient availability. Litter manipulation also added or removed large amounts of carbon thereby affecting microbial communities and altering soil respiration rates. Litter manipulation experiments have shown that litter cover acts as a physical barrier to the shoot emergence of small-seeded species; further, the microclimate maintained by the litter layer may be favourable to herbivores and pathogens and is important in determining later seedling survival and performance. Litter manipulation altered the competitive outcomes between tree seedlings and forbs, thereby influencing species composition and diversity; changes in the species composition of understorey vegetation following treatments occurred fairly rapidly. By decreasing substrate availability and altering the microclimate, litter removal changed fungal species composition and diversity and led to a decline in populations of soil fauna. However, litter addition did not provoke a corresponding increase in the abundance or diversity of fungi or soil fauna. Large-scale long-term studies are still needed in order to investigate the interactions between the many variables affected by litter, especially in tropical and boreal forests, which have received little attention. Litter manipulation treatments present an opportunity to assess the effects of increasing primary production in forest ecosystems; specific research aims include assessing the effects of changes in litter inputs on the carbon and nutrient cycles, decomposition processes, and the turnover of organic matter. {\textcopyright} 2006 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

AB  - Ferriferous savannas, also known as cangas in Brazil, are nutrient-impoverished ecosystems adapted to seasonal droughts. These ecosystems support distinctive vegetation physiognomies and high plant diversity, although little is known about how nutrient and water availability shape these ecosystems. Our study was carried out in the cangas from Caraj{\'{a}}s, eastern Amazonia, Brazil. To investigate the N cycling and drought adaptations of different canga physiognomies and compare the findings with those from other ecosystems, we analyzed nutrient concentrations and isotope ratios ($\delta$13C and $\delta$15N) of plants, litter, and soils from 36 plots distributed in three physiognomies: typical scrubland (SB), Vellozia scrubland (VL), and woodland (WD). Foliar $\delta$15N values in cangas were higher than those in savannas but lower than those in tropical forests, indicating more conservative N cycles in Amazonian cangas than in forests. The lower $\delta$15N in savanna formations may be due to a higher importance of mycorrhizal species in savanna vegetation than in canga vegetation. Elevated $\delta$13C values indicate higher water shortage in canga ecosystems than in forests. Foliar and litter nutrient concentrations vary among canga physiognomies, indicating differences in nutrient dynamics. Lower nutrient availability, higher C:N ratios, and lower $\delta$15N values characterize VL, whereas WD is delineated by lower $\delta$13C values and higher soil P. These results suggest lower water restriction and lower P limitation in WD, whereas VL shows more conserved N cycles due to lower nutrient availability. Differences in nutrient and water dynamics among physiognomies indicate different ecological processes; thus, the conservation of all physiognomies is required to ensure the maintenance of functional diversity in this unique ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Summary: In northern forests, belowground sequestration of nitrogen (N) in complex organic pools restricts nutrient availability to plants. Oxidative extracellular enzymes produced by ectomycorrhizal fungi may aid plant N acquisition by providing access to N in macromolecular complexes. We test the hypotheses that ectomycorrhizal Cortinarius species produce Mn-dependent peroxidases, and that the activity of these enzymes declines at elevated concentrations of inorganic N. In a boreal pine forest and a sub-arctic birch forest, Cortinarius DNA was assessed by 454-sequencing of ITS amplicons and related to Mn-peroxidase activity in humus samples with- and without previous N amendment. Transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes was investigated in field samples. Phylogenetic analyses of Cortinarius peroxidase amplicons and genome sequences were performed. We found a significant co-localization of high peroxidase activity and DNA from Cortinarius species. Peroxidase activity was reduced by high ammonium concentrations. Amplification of mRNA sequences indicated transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes under field conditions. The Cortinarius glaucopus genome encodes 11 peroxidases - a number comparable to many white-rot wood decomposers. These results support the hypothesis that some ectomycorrhizal fungi - Cortinarius species in particular - may play an important role in decomposition of complex organic matter, linked to their mobilization of organically bound N. {\textcopyright} 2014 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - Pyrophilous macrofungi (PM) are a narrowly specialised group appearing exclusively in plant communities recently destroyed by fire. Their significance has hitherto been studied only for vegetation destroyed over large areas, while in small areas of fire, i.e., microhabitats they are viewed as independent components of the community linked only to the substratum. In the present work, the following hypotheses were tested: (1) species structures of PM in microhabitats depend on the type of plant community, (2) PM form communities on a small scale which are similar in structure and function to analogous large scale communities. We studied 20 surfaces destroyed by illegal campfires in four natural plant communities: oak-hornbeam forest Tilio-Carpinetum (TC), lowland acidophilus beech forest Luzulo pilosae-Fagetum (LF), suboceanic pine forest Leucobryo-Pinetum (LP), and an initial-phase xerothermic grassland community on a transitional habitat (MH). TC and LF habitats were conspicuously more favourable for PM than LP and MH. In TC and LF fire leads to significant loss of mycorrhizae in the upper layer of leaf litter. This provides a development opportunity for ectomycorrhizal PM species which, having little competition, substitute for the destroyed fragments of mycorrhizal networks. In LP and MH fire over a small surface does not destroy more deeply located mycorrhizal associations. Another important factor for PM influencing the quality of environment is the fertility of soil: highest in TC, intermediate in LF and lowest in LP and MH. The results casts doubt on the concept that PM are only synusia linked to the substratum (burnt wood). PM growing in microhabitats constitute an important group of organisms which facilitate rapid regeneration of plant community fragments destroyed by fire. (c) 2012 The British Mycological Society.

AB  - Subtropical broadleaved forests play a crucial role in supporting terrestrial ecosystem functions, but little is known about their belowground soil fungal communities despite that they have central functions in C, N, and P cycles. This study investigated the structures and identified the drivers of soil fungal communities in subtropical deciduous and evergreen broadleaved forests, using high-throughput sequencing and FUNGuild for fungal identification and assignment to the trophic guild. Fungal richness was much higher in the deciduous than in the evergreen forest. Both forests were dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla, but saprophytic fungi were more abundant in the deciduous forest and ectomycorrhizal fungi predominated in the evergreen forest. Fungal communities had strong links to plant and soil properties. Specifically, plant diversity and litter biomass were the main aboveground drivers of fungal diversity and composition in the deciduous forest, while host effects were prominent in the evergreen forest. The belowground factors, i.e., soil pH, water content, and nutrients especially available P, were identified as the primary drivers of soil fungal communities in the broadleaved forests. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed assembly of fungal composition in broadleaved forest soils was non-random. The smaller modularity of the network in the deciduous forest reflects lower resistance to environment changes. Concluding, these results showed that plant community attributes, soil properties, and potential interactions among fungal functional guilds operate jointly on the divergence of soil fungal community assembly in the two broadleaved forest types. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Fungi are primary agents of organic matter decomposition in forests. Although invertebrate grazing affects fungal biomass and morphology, the species-specific consequences of these interactions are little understood. Using three collembola species (Folsomia candida, Protaphorura armata, Proisotoma minuta) we employed a multi-trophic approach to investigate the individual effects of invertebrate grazing on four species of saprotrophic basidiomycete fungi growing in two species (one fungus: one collembola) soil microcosms. We studied these effects at three trophic levels: the rate of wood decay brought about by the fungi was assessed; fungal growth was characterized across multiple time points using a range of image analysis parameters (radial extension, hyphal coverage, fractal dimension); and collembola abundance was determined at the end of the experiment. Collembola species had different impacts both within and across fungal species; F. candida had the greatest effect on fungal mycelia whereas P. armata often had little impact. Fungal species varied in their resilience to grazing; all collembola species modified Phanerochaete velutina and Hypholoma fasciculare morphology, that of Resinicium bicolor was only markedly affected by F. candida, and effects on Phallus impudicus were negligible. In the case of H. fasciculare, these grazing effects translated into effects on the rate of fungus-induced wood decay: F. candida and P. armata, but not P. minuta, reduced wood decay rate compared to ungrazed controls. Rate of wood decay was unaffected in the other three fungal species. Changes in collembola population size were generally consistent across fungal species, with each species achieving a greater abundance on P. velutina than on H. fasciculare and P. impudicus. The collembola species did, however, respond differently to R. bicolor, with F. candida being more successful than P. armata. Our study suggests that a wide range of impacts can occur during fungus-collembola interactions, and that caution should be exercised when treating saprotrophic fungi and mycophagous collembola as uniform functional components. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Proper estimates of decomposition are essential for tropical forests, given their key role in the global carbon (C) cycle. However, the current paradigm for litter decomposition is insufficient to account for recent observations and may limit model predictions for highly diverse tropical ecosystems. In light of recent findings from a nutrient-poor Amazonian rainforest, we revisit the commonly held views that: litter traits are a mere legacy of live leaf traits; nitrogen (N) and lignin are the key litter traits controlling decomposition; and favourable climatic conditions result in rapid decomposition in tropical forests. Substantial interspecific variation in litter phosphorus (P) was found to be unrelated to variation in green leaves. Litter nutrients explained no variation in decomposition, which instead was controlled primarily by nonlignin litter C compounds at low concentrations with important soil fauna effects. Despite near-optimal climatic conditions, tropical litter decomposition proceeded more slowly than in a climatically less favourable temperate forest. We suggest that slow decomposition in the studied rainforest results from a syndrome of poor litter C quality beyond a simple lignin control, enforcing energy starvation of decomposers. We hypothesize that the litter trait syndrome in nutrient-poor tropical rainforests may have evolved to increase plant access to limiting nutrients via mycorrhizal associations. {\textcopyright} The Authors (2010).

AB  - Among the huge array of hypogeous ectomycorrhizal fungi so far documented from Australia, six genera and more than 30 species occur within the family Mesophelliaceae, all of which show various adaptations for surviving in fire-prone landscapes. These mostly endemic fungi are critical to postfire reestablishment of regenerating vegetation, and their fruit-bodies provide essential food resources for diverse ground-dwelling fauna. We developed habitat models for five common representatives of the mesophelliaceae based on repeat collections of their fruit-bodies from 136 study plots situated along a series of environmental gradients across the south-eastern mainland of Australia. At a meso- or landscape scale, temperature influenced the occurrence of Castoreum radicatum, Mesophellia clelandii and Nothocastoreum cretaceum, with the type of response varying. Below a threshold, C. radicatum preferred sites with cooler mean annual temperatures. In contrast, M. clelandii and N. cretaceum had optimal ranges of temperature, above and below which the probability of detecting them dropped. Also at a landscape scale, C. radicatum was more likely to be detected at sites with lower levels of precipitation during the driest quarter of the year. At a micro-site scale, M. clelandii and N. cretaceum were more likely to occur in stands with an intermediate number of host eucalypt stems, likely relating to successional age of the stand. Sites with a higher number of large fallen trees were more likely to have N. cretaceum, while sites with intermediate litter depths were more likely to have C. radicatum and M. clelandii. Mesophellia glauca and M. trabalis showed no consistent patterns. They are apparently the most broadly adaptable in terms of the independent variables tested. Although fire has been previously suggested to be heavily implicated in the life cycle of several members of the Mesophelliaceae, we found no relationship between time since disturbance by fire and other factors and likelihood of occurrence. Instead, other habitat attributes appeared to be more important in explaining their distribution. The complex and differing responses of the species of Mesophelliaceae studied here, to features of their environment, reinforce the need to manage multiple-use forest landscapes across the region for a diversity of attributes.

AB  - Climate warming and associated increases in nutrient mineralization may increase the availability of soil nitrogen (N) in high latitude ecosystems, such as boreal forests. These changes in N availability could feed back to affect the decomposition of litter and organic matter by soil microbes. Since fungi are important decomposers in boreal forest ecosystems, we conducted a 69-day incubation study to examine N constraints on fungal decomposition of organic substrates common in boreal ecosystems, including cellulose, lignin, spruce wood, spruce needle litter, and moss litter. We added 0, 20, or 200 $\mu$g N to vials containing 200 mg substrate in factorial combination with five fungal species isolated from boreal soil, including an Ascomycete, a Zygomycete, and three Basidiomycetes. We hypothesized that N addition would increase CO2 mineralization from the substrates, particularly those with low N concentrations. In addition we predicted that Basidiomycetes would be more effective decomposers than the other fungi, but would respond weakly or negatively to N additions. In support of the first hypothesis, cumulative CO2 mineralization increased from 635 ± 117 to 806 + 108 $\mu$g C across all fungal species and substrates in response to 20 $\mu$g added N; however, there was no significant increase at the highest level of N addition. The positive effect of N addition was only significant on cellulose and wood substrates which contained very little N. We also observed clear differences in the substrate preferences of the fungal species. The Zygomycete mineralized little CO2 from any of the substrates, while the Basidiomycetes mineralized all of the substrates except spruce needles. However, the Ascomycete (Penicillium) was surprisingly efficient at mineralizing spruce wood and was the only species that substantially mineralized spruce litter. The activities of $\beta$-glucosidase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase were strongly correlated with cumulative respiration (r = 0.78 and 0.74, respectively), and Penicillium was particularly effective at producing these enzymes. On moss litter, the different fungal species produced enzymes that targeted different chemical components. Overall, our results suggest that fungal species specialize on different organic substrates, and only respond to N addition on low N substrates, such as wood. Furthermore, the response to N addition is non-linear, with the greatest substrate mineralization at intermediate N levels. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fine roots account for a substantial proportion of forest production and their decomposition releases large amounts of nutrients to the soil ecosystem. However, little is known about the fungi involved in ECM decomposition, including assemblages of fungal saprotrophs, endophytes, and the ECM fungi themselves. To follow fungal succession during the degradation of senescing fine roots, understory seedlings of Abies balsamea and Picea rubens at two sites in the Acadian forest of Nova Scotia were either severed at the root collar or left as controls. Root systems were collected sequentially over two growing seasons and assessed for fine root loss and ECM mantle integrity. ECM were identified by ITS-PCR and grouped into broad morphological categories. Fungal communities colonizing the senescing fine roots were also monitored by systematically constructing clone libraries over the course of the experiment. ECM with cottony, weakly pigmented mantles (e.g., Cortinarius) degraded within the first year. Those with cottony, but intensely pigmented mantles (Piloderma), and smooth mantles with weak pigmentation (Russulaceae) degraded more slowly. Smooth, melanized ECM (Cenococcum and Tomentella) generally maintained integrity over the course of the experiment. Rates of fine root loss and changes in ECM mantle integrity were positively correlated with soil temperature. ECM DNA was detected throughout the experiment, and was not replaced by that of saprotrophic species during the two seasons sampled. However, fungal root endophytes (e.g., Helotiaceae) initially increased in abundance and then decreased as mantles degraded, suggesting a possible role in ECM decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - • Introduction: Important nutrients in forest soils such as nitrogen and phosphorus are mostly recycled from natural polymeric compounds contained in litter and organic debris-for example nucleic acids, proteins, or chitin. • Objectives: Activities of enzymes such as phosphatases, proteases, cellulases, chitinases and laccase were shown in saprotrophic but also in ectomycorrhizal fungi and there is increasing evidence that these enzymes contribute not only to the functioning of the symbiosis but also to the mobilisation of nutrients. In the present review, we describe how enzyme secretion and localisation on fungal hyphae may be connected to the potential role in soil nutrient cycling. • Results: Recently developed methods for enzyme activity studies of ectomycorrhizae directly assayed in or collected from the field such as enzyme activity profiling and soil imprinting are described. Their value and limitations in different examples of ecological studies is highlighted and discussed also with respect to the role of other soil microorganisms associated with ectomycorrhizae. • Conclusion: The conclusion from our review is that enzyme activities of ECM and their associated microorganisms provide a potentially enormous plasticity of mycorrhizosphere functionality which is an open field for further research.

AB  - Many saprotrophic fungi, especially basidiomycetes, which are able to grow out of the substratum that they are colonizing in search of new resources (i.e., nonresource-unit-restricted fungi) form mycelial cords, which are aggregations of predominantly parallel, longitudinally aligned hyphae. These cords often form extensive, long-lived systems which interconnect discrete nutrient resources, e.g. woody litter components, on the floor of boreal, temperate and tropical forests, and some can form networks in tropical canopies. They exhibit foraging strategies which vary among species, and which alter depending on resource quantity and quality, the presence of other organisms, and microclimatic environment. The morphological patterns they form are well described by fractal geometry. Their mycelia show remarkable patterns of reallocation of biomass and mineral nutrients when new resources are encountered during mycelial foraging or when new resources are added to mature systems. Mycelial-cord systems encountering heterogeneously distributed organic substrata coordinate use of available resources so that demands are met by `spreading the load' through the system. The persistent networks, ability to forage for new resources, and ability to reallocate mycelial biomass and nutrients exhibited by saprotrophic cord-forming fungi provide a solution to the problems of life in a spatially and temporally heterogenous environment. Response to the heterogenous environ ment in which these fungi exist generates heterogeneity in themselves, and they in turn generate heterogeneity in their environment, both in space and time.

AB  - The patterns of the distribution of fungal species and their potential interactions with trees remain understudied in Neotropical rainforests, which harbor more than 16,000 tree species, mostly dominated by endomycorrhizal trees. Our hypothesis was that tree species shape the non-mycorrhizal fungal assemblages in soil and litter and that the diversity of fungal communities in these two compartments is partly dependent on the coverage of trees in the Neotropical rainforest. In French Guiana, a long-term plantation and a natural forest were selected to test this hypothesis. Fungal ITS1 regions were sequenced from soil and litter samples from within the vicinity of tree species. A broad range of fungal taxa was found, with 42 orders and 14 classes. Significant spatial heterogeneity in the fungal communities was found without strong variation in the species richness and evenness among the tree plots. However, tree species shaped the fungal assemblages in the soil and litter, explaining up to 18 % of the variation among the communities in the natural forest. These results demonstrate that vegetation cover has an important effect on the structure of fungal assemblages inhabiting the soil and litter in Amazonian forests, illustrating the relative impact of deterministic processes on fungal community structures in these highly diverse ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - In the boreal forests of eastern Canada, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns, Poggenb.) regeneration often fails in nutrient-poor sites dominated by Kalmia angustifolia L. occurring after nonsevere forest fire, clearcut harvesting, and insect defoliation. Traditional silvicultural treatments have limited success in regenerating these sites. We tested whether forest floor mixing and planting black spruce seedlings preinoculated with an ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungus, Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr., has potential to improve black spruce growth in Kalmia-dominated sites. We measured growth and foliar nutrient concentrations of ECM-inoculated and control black spruce seedlings planted in burned and insect-defoliated sites after forest floor mixing in Terra Nova National Park, Newfoundland. We also measured soil moisture, temperature, pH, total phenol and nutrient concentrations, litter decomposition, and soil respiration in those sites. Seedlings in soil-mixed plots had significantly higher growth and foliar nutrient concentrations than nonmixed plots, likely because soil mixing improved the substrate conditions by increased soil moisture, pH, and litter decomposition. Seedlings in insect-defoliated sites had significantly higher increases in height and foliar nutrient concentrations than those in the burned sites. Inoculated seedlings had significantly higher initial ECM formation than the control seedlings, but they failed to achieve higher growth.

Japanese oak forests of Fukushima and the northern Kanto area were contaminated with radiocesium (137Cs) by Fukusima Dai-ichi nuclear Power Plant accident. 137Cs trapped at the surface soil has a deleterious effect on forest ecosystem and poses further threat to humans when it enters the food chain. The uptake of 137Cs and other essential nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) by plants with the aid of ectomycorrhizal fungi is affected by soil water content. The objective of this study was to evaluate the colonization rate of ectomycorrhiza (CRE) and its impact on nutrients and 137Cs uptake pattern by oak (Quercus serrata Thunb.) seedlings at different soil water content levels under greenhouse condition. The result shows that the growth of Q. serrata seedlings increased with increasing soil water content. In addition, the highest CRE was observed in the low water content (LW) and was significantly different from the high water content treatment (HW). The LW treatment showed the highest N and P concentration in leaves and roots although no statistical differences were observed compared to the other treatments. Treatments with 137Cs-amended litter showed increased 137Cs concentration in the leaves of plants and its leaf per root ratio increased with decreasing soil water content. The results of the present study also suggest enhanced 137Cs absorption and translocation into Q. serrata seedlings is with the aid of ectomycorrhizal fungus except for the seedlings in HW. {\textcopyright} 2019, International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering.

AB  - In a highly damaged, 120-150 year old Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) stand, still used for grazing, with a protective function against avalanches and rockfall, a fertilization experiment for revitalization was carried out. A slow release fertilizer containing macro-and micronutrients was applied over three years, from 1986 to 1988. Four years after the last treatment, the proportion of trees with a needle loss of >25% decreased from initially 60-80% to 24% in the treated plots, while in the control plots it remained unchanged. A significant increase of radial increment (+100%), shoot growth (+40%), needle length (+20%) and starch content in the fine roots (+40%) was established as well. The supply with P which had been low initially was significantly increased. No changes could be observed in fine root biomass or mycorrhization. In the soil, an alpine rendzina on dolomite, a significant reservoir of P and tendentially of K was still detectable three years after the last treatment. Cellulose decomposition was slightly enhanced in the uppermost soil layer of the treated plots but no changes in the C/N ratio or in pH were found. {\textcopyright} 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The complex interactions between trees and soil microbes in forests as well as their inherent seasonal and spatial variations are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the effects of major European tree species (Fagus sylvatica L. and Picea abies (L.) Karst) on soil bacterial and fungal communities. Mineral soil samples were collected from different depths (0-10, 10-20 cm) and at different horizontal distances from beech or spruce trunks (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 m) in early summer and autumn. We assessed the composition of soil bacterial and fungal communities based on 16S rRNA gene and ITS DNA sequences. Community composition of bacteria and fungi was most strongly affected by soil pH and tree species. Different ectomycorrhizal fungi (e.g., Tylospora) known to establish mutualistic associations with plant roots showed a tree species preference. Moreover, bacterial and fungal community composition showed spatial and seasonal shifts in soil surrounding beech and spruce. The relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi was higher at a depth of 0-10 vs. 10-20 cm depth. This was presumably a result of changes in nutrient availability, as litter input and organic carbon content decreased with soil depth. Overall bacterial community composition showed strong variations under spruce with increasing distance from the tree trunks, which might be attributed in part to higher fine root biomass near spruce trunks. Furthermore, overall bacterial community composition was strongly affected by season under deciduous trees. {\textcopyright} 2016 Nacke, Goldmann, Sch{\"{o}}ning, Pfeiffer, Kaiser, Castillo-Villamizar, Schrumpf, Buscot, Daniel and Wubet.

AB  - Nematodes of different trophic groups control distinct energy channels, though their exact trophic links remain little understood. Molecular data suggest that soil nematodes are readily consumed by a wide range of other soil animals, but the significance of these interactions remains unknown. We used stable isotope analysis to gain a better understanding of the trophic niches of soil nematodes in a boreal forest. We tested four taxonomic groups, Mononchida, Dorylaimida, Plectidae and Tylenchidae (mostly from the genus Filenchus), representing predators, omnivores, bacterivores and root-fungal feeders, respectively. To assess the trophic position of nematodes, we used a set of reference species including herbivorous, saprophagous and predatory macro-invertebrates, oribatid and mesostigmatid mites, and collembolans. The trophic positions of the investigated groups of soil nematodes generally agree with common knowledge. All nematodes were enriched in C-13 relative to Picea abies roots and litter, as well as to fungal mycelium analyzed. Root-fungal feeders Tylenchidae had delta N-15 values similar to those of earthworms, enchytraeids and Entomobrya collembolans. In contrast, bacterivorous Plectidae were enriched in N-15 compared to saprophagous macroinvertebrates and most mesofauna species. Omnivorous Dorylaimida and predatory Mononchida were further enriched in N-15 and their isotopic signature was very similar to that of predatory arthropods. These data confirm a clear separation of nematodes into microbial feeders (Tylenchidae and Plectidae) and predators (Mononchida and Dorylaimida). They also suggest that the trophic position of soil animals is largely independent of their body size, the smallest soil predators like nematodes occupying the same trophic level as predatory macro-invertebrates. Our data failed to confirm that bacterivorous or predatory soil nematodes are important prey for oribatid mites or collembolans. The patterns of isotopic signatures indicate that soil nematodes and the bulk of soil animals depend on resources derived from a dominating upper-canopy tree (P. abies) via the detrital rather than mycorrhizal pathway. Herbaceous plants and dwarf shrubs do not contribute significantly to the energy budget of soil communities in the boreal forest studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), birch (Betula spp.), hazel (Corylus avellana L.), sessile oak {[}Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.] and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) leaf litters from a virtually non-polluted and a heavily sulphur dioxide (SO2)-polluted woodland were fumigated with environmentally-realistic concentrations (0.010-0.030 mul l-1) of SO2 for 16-68 wk in an open-air field-fumigation experiment. Fumigation inhibited the respiration (CO2 evolution) and decomposition rates of the leaf litters. However, there were few differences in the responses between leaf litters from the two woodlands. In addition, pure cultures of four saprotrophic fungi were grown individually on irradiated hazel litter and exposed to c. 0.030 mul l-1 of gaseous SO2 for 28 d in the laboratory. The gas inhibited the respiration of Phoma exigua Desm. and Phoma macrostoma Mont. but not the respiration of Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fres.) de Vries or Coniothyrium quercinum Sacc. var. glandicola Grove. These results in part substantiated findings of previous experiments examining the effects of SO2 on the structures of saprotrophic fungal communities. The effects of SO2 on fungal decomposition of angiosperm tree leaf litter as possible causes of forest decline are discussed.

AB  - Although the importance of coarse woody debris (CWD) for species diversity is recognized, the effects of coarse woody debris decay class on species composition have received little attention. We examined how the species composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) changes with CWD decay. We describe ectomycorrhizal root tips and the diversity of mycorrhizal fungal species at three English oak (Quercus robur L.) sites. DNA barcoding revealed a total of 17 ECM fungal species. The highest degree of mycorrhizal colonization was found in CWDadvanced (27.2%) and CWDearly (27.1%). Based on exploration types, ectomycorrhizae were classified with respect to ecologically relevant soil features. The short distance type was significantly correlated with soil P2O5, while the contact type was correlated with soil C/N. The lowest mean content of soil Corg was found in the CWDabsent site. The difference in total soil N between sites decreased with increasing CWD decomposition, whereas total C/N increased correspondingly. In this study we confirmed that soil CWD stimulates ectomycorrhizal fungi, representing contact or short-distance exploration types of mycelium. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The nutrient mobilizing activities of mycelia of two ectomycorrhizal fungi, Suillus bovinus (Fr.) O. Kuntze and Thelephora terrestris (Ehrh.), were investigated in transparent root observation chambers to which were added discrete weighed samples of organic matter collected from the fermentation horizon of a pine‐forest soil. The mycelia grew from mycorrhizal plants of Pinus sylvestris L. over a homogeneous humified peat and colonized the introduced fermentation horizon organic matter (FHOM). The chronology of intensive mycelial exploitation of the FHOM was followed, and its nutrient status was monitored before and after colonization by the fungal mycelia. The time from initial colonization to early senescence of mycelial patches was c. 40 d. Colonization by S. bovinus reduced concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K.) in FHOM by 23, 22 and 30%, respectively, whereas colonization by T. terrestris led to decreases of N and K of 13 and 21 % respectively, but did not change P concentration. There were increases in calcium and magnesium concentration following colonization by terrestris. Analyses of the inorganic N pool of uncolonized FHOM incubated separately suggested that mineralization rates were inadequate to explain the loss of N from the colonized material. The carbon to nitrogen ratio of material colonized by both fungi increased greatly relative to that in uncolonized material. The significance of these nutrient transfer processes is discussed in relation to element cycling processes in boreal forest ecosystems. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - A large proportion of the soil carbon (C) in boreal forests originates from roots and ectomycorrhizal fungi, and accurate quantification of fine-root litter production is needed. Methods for determination of root turnover have been under debate in recent years. Two recently used methods—radiocarbon (14C) dating and use of minirhizotrons (MR)—have yielded different results. This has been attributed to analysis of different roots by use of these methods. At Flakaliden, northern Sweden, in a long-term soil warming and irrigation experiment, we compared MR lifespan with the 14C-derived age of fine roots from soil cores of the same root diameter class. We also determined the 14C-derived age of ingrowth core roots of Norway spruce. The median lifespan of fine roots around MR tubes installed 15 years previously was shorter than 2.5 years whereas the 14C-derived age of the fine roots from soil cores varied from recently grown to 14 years. Correspondingly, the age of 14C in fine roots harvested from ingrowth cores installed in soil 3 months previously was between 1 and 20 years. Thus, cellulose in these roots contained older 14C than is possible from photosynthesis during the time of cellulose formation. By investigating whether the age of Norway spruce and Scots pine seedlings was less than their root 14C-derived age, we tested the possibility of root C originating from soil uptake. This was found to be unlikely, because fine roots of four and eight-year-old seedlings had 14C that was dated to be as old as or younger than the seedlings. We propose that further effort is required to identify the ecological conditions leading to root growth utilization of stored or recycled C. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Milium effusum L. (Wood Millet) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. The grass Milium effusum is a common species of mature woodland in central and southern England, but is less common in the wetter parts of northern England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. World-wide, the species is native to many temperate, boreal, subarctic and subalpine parts of the northern hemisphere: from eastern North America across most of Europe (excluding Mediterranean climates) to the Ural Mountains and Black Sea, extending eastwards to the Himalaya, Korea and Japan. Wood Millet is a shade-tolerant, relatively tall grass (up to 1{\textperiodcentered}8 m) producing up to 700 caryopses per individual. It is characteristic of temperate deciduous woodland, but can also occur in other woodland and forest types and even in scrub, alpine meadows, along railways and roads, and on rocks. In woods, it is one of the most conspicuous plants of the herb layer in the early summer after the disappearance of spring flowering species. While the species is generally considered an ancient woodland indicator in England and western Europe, it is also known to colonize secondary, post-agricultural forests relatively rapidly in other areas such as Denmark, southern Sweden and Poland. The species has a wide amplitude in terms of soil acidity and nutrient availability, but predominantly grows on soils of intermediate soil fertility and soil pH and with high organic matter concentration. However, M. effusum can tolerate large quantities of tree-leaf litter on the forest floor and is able to grow on very acidic soils. Changes in land use, climate, densities of large herbivores and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen are having effects on populations of Wood Millet. Significant responses of the life-history traits and population characteristics have been detected in response to environmental variation and to experimental treatments of temperature, nutrients, light and acidity. In many of its habitats across its range, M. effusum is currently becoming more frequent. During the last century, its mean elevation of occurrence in upland areas of Europe has also increased by several hundreds of metres. Typically, management actions are directed towards the conservation of its main habitat type (e.g. ancient woodlands of the Milio-Fagetum association) rather than to the species specifically. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Deforestation of tropical peat swamp forests is rapidly taking place across Southeast Asia to make way for agricultural expansion. Within forest ecosystems, macrofungi play a vital role, including wood decomposition and nutrient cycles. To reveal the effects of deforestation and land cover conversion on macrofungi in Southeast Asian tropical forests we assessed the relationship between environmental variables such as air temperature, relative air humidity, soil pH, soil moisture, canopy cover, canopy closure, habitat type (i.e., peat swamp forest, large-scale plantation, monoculture smallholding, and polyculture smallholding) and available substrata with macrofungal species richness and abundance. We sample macrofungi across four habitats on Peninsula Malaysia including peat swamp forest, large-scale plantations, monoculture smallholding and polyculture smallholding. We found that substrate richness had a positive effect on macrofungal morphospecies richness, while soil pH and air temperature had a negative effect. For macrofungal abundance, canopy closure and soil moisture had negative effects, whereas substrate richness and relative air humidity had positive effects. Our data showed considerable variation in functional group responses to environmental variables. The abundance of wood-inhabiting fungi was driven primarily by substrate richness, while relative air humidity, soil moisture, and habitat type play minor roles. The abundance of terricolous saprotrophic fungi was determined principally by habitat type, substrate richness, and relative air humidity. Macrofungal community structure was mainly influenced by substrate richness, followed by microclimates and soil characteristics. Our results can provides critical ecological data to support conservation stakeholders conserve macrofungi in natural and agricultural peatlands. Our study suggests that the expansion of oil palm monocultures, to the detriment of peat swamp forests, is likely to have negative effects on macrofungal biodiversity and further agricultural expansion should be prevented.

AB  - The influence exerted by tree communities, topography, and soil chemistry on the assembly of macrofungal communities remains poorly understood, especially in highly diverse tropical forests. Here, we used a large dataset that combines inventories of macrofungal Basidiomycetes fruiting bodies, tree species composition, and measurements for 16 soil physicochemical parameters, collected in 34 plots located in four sites of lowland rain forests in French Guiana. Plots were established on three different topographical conditions: hilltop, slope, and seasonally flooded soils. We found hyperdiverse Basidiomycetes communities, mainly comprising members of Agaricales and Polyporales. Phosphorus, clay contents, and base saturation in soils strongly varied across plots and shaped the richness and composition of tree communities. The latter composition explained 23% of the variation in the composition of macrofungal communities, probably through high heterogeneity of the litter chemistry and selective effects of biotic interactions. The high local heterogeneity of habitats influenced the distribution of both macrofungi and trees, as a result of diversed local soil hydromorphic conditions associated with contrasting soil chemistry. This first regional study across habitats of French Guiana forests revealed new niches for macrofungi, such as ectomycorrhizal ones, and illustrates how macrofungi inventories are still paramount to can be to understand the processes at work in the tropics.

AB  - Forestry reshapes ecosystems with respect to tree age structure, soil properties and vegetation composition. These changes are likely to be paralleled by shifts in microbial community composition with potential feedbacks on ecosystem functioning. Here, we assessed fungal communities across a chronosequence of managed Pinus sylvestris stands and investigated correlations between taxonomic composition and extracellular enzyme activities. Not surprisingly, clear-cutting had a negative effect on ectomycorrhizal fungal abundance and diversity. In contrast, clear-cutting favoured proliferation of saprotrophic fungi correlated with enzymes involved in holocellulose decomposition. During stand development, the re-establishing ectomycorrhizal fungal community shifted in composition from dominance by Atheliaceae in younger stands to Cortinarius and Russula species in older stands. Late successional ectomycorrhizal taxa correlated with enzymes involved in mobilisation of nutrients from organic matter, indicating intensified nutrient limitation. Our results suggest that maintenance of functional diversity in the ectomycorrhizal fungal community may sustain long-term forest production by retaining a capacity for symbiosis-driven recycling of organic nutrient pools. {\textcopyright} 2017 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved 1751-7362/17.

AB  - The current requirements to decrease the consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuels have increased the demand of renewable energy sources. In forestry, this situation has intensified harvesting practices resulting in a decreased amount of woody debris left on the clear-cut areas. Impacts of energy wood harvest on wood-decomposing fungi were studied in a large-scale experiment in clear-cut stands in three geographical areas in Finland. A sequence of treatments was expected to form a forestry induced soil disturbance gradient: (1) logging residues left at site, no soil preparation; (2) logging residues left at site, patch mounding; (3) 70% logging residue removal, patch mounding; and (4) complete stump and logging residue removal, patch mounding. Pre-weighed wood discs were incubated on the intact soil cover for four years to estimate decomposition rate and fungal decomposer community. A soil sample was taken underneath each disc to evaluate the direct inoculation potential of the soil. The main results were as follows: (1) The differences between the treatments were not significant, while the geographical factors affected the decomposition rate and the fungal communities of the wood discs. (2) The fungal composition in the wood discs did not reflect the underlying soil fungal community, which indicates that a part of the fungal species inhabiting wood discs originated from airborne surrounding sources. (3) The increase in fungal species diversity was associated to the wood decay process, indicated by parallel increase in the wood decomposition rate and the number of white rot and mycorrhizal fungi. Thus our study indicates that in addition to local environment, landscape-level factors control the decomposer fungal community and its activity in wood. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Saprotrophic macrofungi are key decomposers of plant biomass in forests. These fungi form ecologically diverse group where different species specialize in specific substrates. Wildfires produce massive amounts of heterogeneous dead substrates. The postfire succession of saprotrophic fungi on these substrates may have major consequences on how carbon and nutrients are released back to forest ecosystems after a fire. We studied the effects of a wildfire (covering 143 ha) on saptroptrophic macrofungi (Basidiomycota and Ascomycota) in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) dominated forest in eastern Finland during 12 years after the wildfire. In particular, we focused on the consequences that within-fire variation in fire severity had on fungal assemblages. Twenty-two permanent sample plots (10 × 10 m2 each) were monitored annually. Plots were located on sites with four different fire severity classes and on two unburned control sites. A total of 43 102 sporocarps of macrofungi were collected. Based on fungal life histories, we separated four different groups in the analyses: (1) wood-associated fungi on decayed wood, (2) decomposers of organic matter in soil or that live on bare mineral soil in forest floor, (3) biotrophic macrofungi that are associations between algae and fungi and that may also be symbiotic with mycorrhizae fungi, and (4) parasites on a living host plant or other fungi. In total, 219 species were observed. Fire severity affected species richness and composition, and fire always increased fungal diversity in comparison with unburned control sites. On the burned sites, species richness was highest on sites of medium burn severity (114 species in total, vs. 88–106 spp. on other burned sites). Substrate association of species was closely connected to assemblage dynamics: on soil and humus substrates, the succession of fire-associated pyrophilous species was rapid when compared to the succession of aphyllophoroid wood-associated macrofungi (AWAM). Pyrophilous and AWAM assemblages comprised many indicator species that occurred only ephemerally during the few years after the fire. In previous studies, AWAM assemblages often respond negatively to forest fires in short-term. Our results, however, show that if also other than AWAM macrofungi are included, there are several species typical for immediate post-fire habitats. The role that these species have on forest ecosystem and – for example – on carbon dynamics after a wildfire remains an important topic for future studies. From the conservation viewpoint, the finding emphasizes that post-fire young successional forests are important habitats for specialized and rare fungi. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soil fungi are integral to decomposition in forests and other habitats, yet identifying probable functional roles of different taxa is problematic. Here, we compared carbohydrate assimilation patterns derived from stable isotope analyses on cultures with patterns of metabolic activity measured on Biolog{\textregistered} SF-P plates for 12 taxa of soil- and litter-inhabiting saprotrophic fungi isolated from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) ecosystems. To determine the relative assimilation of carbon from malt extract versus sucrose by 13C stable isotope analyses, we cultured fungi with malt extract (consisting primarily of glucose and maltose) plus either C3- or C4-derived sucrose as carbon sources. Rhodotorula graminis and F. oxysporum assimilated the highest proportion of sucrose, a Mortierella isolate and an unidentified sterile isolate (FPC 341) assimilated the lowest proportion of sucrose, and remaining cultures assimilated similar and intermediate proportions of sucrose. On Biolog plates, low metabolic activity of Mortierella and FPC 341 on sucrose and R. graminis and F. oxysporum on maltose were qualitatively consistent with isotopic results. Assimilation of sucrose calculated isotopically was correlated with the ratio of sucrose: maltose activity calculated from Biolog assays (r2 = 0.45, P = 0.0145, n = 12). Metabolic activity on Biolog plates for six other common soil carbohydrates were also determined: glucose, fructose, galactose, cellobiose, lactose, and glycogen. Metabolic activity was greatest overall on maltose and glucose and lowest on fructose. Two of the isolates (Aspergillus flavus and F. oxysporum) had higher metabolic activity on the glucose-containing disaccharide cellobiose than on glucose, strongly suggesting preferential uptake of cellobiose compared to glucose and suggesting the potential ability to use cellulose. The high metabolic activity of these cultures on galactose, a primary constituent of hemicellulose, also suggested cellulolytic capabilities. Our results indicated that stable isotope studies and Biolog assays may provide complementary information to characterize metabolic potential of fungi in forest litter and soil.

AB  - • This work tested the hypothesis that ectomycorrhizas (EM) of Dicymbe corymbosa alter leaf-litter decomposition and residual litter quality in tropical forests of Guyana. • Mass loss of leaf litter in litter bags was determined on three occasions, in two experiments, during a 12-month period. Paired root-exclusion plots were located randomly within a D. corymbosa forest. Both D. corymbosaand mixed-species leaf litters were reciprocally transplanted into their respective forest types. Elemental analysis was performed on the residual D. corymbosa leaf litter after 1 yr. • Leaf litter mass loss in the D. corymbosa forest was not influenced by EM, despite high EM colonization. Elemental analysis of D. corymbosa leaf litter residues demonstrated reduced calcium levels in the presence of EM, which were negatively correlated with EM rootlet-colonizing mass. • The lack of EM effect on the litter decomposition rate, coupled with high EM colonization, suggests an important but indirect role in mineral nutrient acquisition. Lowered Ca concentration in leaf litter exposed to EM may suggest a high Ca demand by the ectotroph system. {\textcopyright} New Phytologist (2005).

AB  - Soil-surface CO2 efflux ('soil respiration') accounts for roughly two-thirds of forest ecosystem respiration, and can be divided into heterotrophic and autotrophic components. Conventionally, the latter is defined as respiration by plant roots. In Boreal forests, however, fine roots of trees are invariably covered by ectomycorrhizal fungi, which by definition are heterotrophs, but like the roots, receive sugars derived from photosynthesis. There is also a significant leaching of labile carbon compounds from the ectomycorrhizal roots. It is, therefore, more meaningful in the context of carbon balance studies to include mycorrhizal fungi and other mycorrhizosphere organisms, dependent on the direct flux of labile carbon from photosynthesis, in the autotrophic component. Hence, heterotrophic activity becomes reserved for the decomposition of more complex organic molecules in litter and other forms of soil organic matter. In reality, the complex situation is perhaps best described as a continuum from strict autotrophy to strict heterotrophy. As a result of this, and associated methodological problems, estimates of the contribution of autotrophic respiration to total soil respiration have been highly variable. Based on recent stand-scale tree girdling experiments we have estimated that autotrophic respiration in boreal forest accounts for up to 50-65% of soil respiration during the snow-free part of the year. Girdling experiments and studies of the delta(13)C of the soil CO2 efflux show that there is a lag of a few days between the carbon uptake by photosynthesis and the release by autotrophic soil respiration of the assimilated carbon. In contrast, estimates of 'bomb 14C' and other approaches have suggested that it takes years to decades between carbon uptake via photosynthesis and the bulk of soil heterotrophic activity. Temperature is normally used as a driver in models of soil processes and it is often assumed that autotrophic soil activity is more sensitive to temperature than is heterotrophic activity, but this is questionable. It is inherently difficult to make a precise separation of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration from soils. The partitioning between these two components is highly variable in space and time, and taxonomic autotrophs and heterotrophs may perform the function of the other group to some degree. Care should be taken to disturb as little as possible the delicate plant-microbe-soil system, and this speaks for non-intrusive isotopic methods. There are, however, problems in modelling the flux of isotopes through this complex system. Girdling of tree stands is a very robust alternative approach to make the distinction between autotrophic and heterotrophic activities, but ultimately kills the trees and cannot, therefore, always be used. A further development would be to block the phloem sugar transport reversibly. We propose that thus assumption needs further critical testing.

AB  - Information on the habitat requirements of wood-inhabiting fungi is needed to understand the factors that affect their diversity. We applied culture-free DNA extraction and 454-pyrosequencing to study the mycobiota of decaying Norway spruce (Picea abies) logs in five unmanaged boreal forests. Fungal habitat preferences in respect of wood density gradient were then estimated with generalized additive mixed models. Fungal diversity and wood density were inversely related, i.e., OTU richness generally increased as the log became increasingly decomposed. White-rot fungi (e.g., Phellinus nigrolimitatus) and members of Hyphodontia did not show a clear response to the wood-density gradient, whereas abundance of Phellinus viticola and brown-rot fungi (e.g., Fomitopsis pinicola, Antrodia serialis, Coniophora olivaceae) peaked during intermediate decay and mycorrhizal fungi (e.g., Piloderma, Tylospora, Russula) increased in the later stages. This information on fungal habitat requirements facilitates the development of management practices that preserve fungal diversity in managed forests. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mycorrhizal fungal necromass is increasingly recognized as an important contributor to soil organic carbon pools, particularly in forest ecosystems. While its decomposition rate is primarily determined by biochemical composition, how traits such as melanin content affect the structure of necromass decomposer communities remains poorly understood. To assess the role of biochemical traits on microbial decomposer community composition and functioning, we incubated melanized and non-melanized necromass of the mycorrhizal fungus Meliniomyces bicolor in Pinus- and Quercus-dominated forests in Minnesota, USA and then assessed the associated fungal and bacterial decomposer communities after 1, 2 and 3 months using high-throughput sequencing. Melanized necromass decomposed significantly slower than non-melanized necromass in both forests. The structure of the microbial decomposer communities depended significantly on necromass melanin content, although the effect was stronger for fungi than bacteria. On non-melanized necromass, fungal communities were dominated by r-selected ascomycete and mucoromycete microfungi early and then replaced by basidiomycete ectomycorrhizal fungi, while on melanized necromass these groups were co-dominant throughout the incubation. Bacterial communities were dominated by both specialist mycophageous and generalist taxa. Synthesis. Our results indicate that necromass biochemistry not only strongly affects rates of decomposition but also the structure of the associated decomposer communities. Furthermore, the observed colonization patterns suggest that fungi, and particularly ectomycorrhizal fungi, may play a more important role in necromass decomposition than previously recognized. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Although boreal forests are biomes which are characterized by periodical forest wildfires, very little is known about adaptations to fire in forest herbs. We investigated whether a putatively fire-dependent herbaceous species - Pulsatilla patens - demonstrated adaptive responses to environmental cues that reflect differences in pre-fire and post-fire environments (the presence of ericoid litter and charcoal, and light levels). For comparison, we included in the experiment a close congeneric species that is less bound to forest ecosystems (Pulsatilla pratensis) and a morphologically similar mesic grassland species from the same family (Ranunculus polyanthemos), as examples of species for which adaptations to fire should be of lower value, or of no value at all, respectively. The addition of ericoid litter to the soil generally enhanced plant growth, suggesting that its negative effect on plant germination and growth is not as widespread as previously thought. In both Pulsatilla species charcoal without forest litter retarded plant growth, but in combination with ericoid litter the negative effect disappeared or was even replaced by a slightly positive effect. Such an interactive effect was absent in the grassland species R. polyanthemos. The response of Pulsatilla species to different post-fire signals may be explained by adaptive down-regulation of growth after high-intensity fire - small plant size can be advantageous in sparse and well illuminated field-layer vegetation - and intense growth in the more competitive situation following weak fire. An additional experiment demonstrated that the effects of fire-related treatments were not mediated by differential AM infection. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - This study was designed to measure the microbiological and chemical characteristics of forest soils in a chronosequence of harvested Douglas-fir (Pseusotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) stands in different climatic settings. Mineral soil samples were collected along transects running from old-growth (OG) forests into harvested stands of ages 5, 15, and 40 years (5YS, 15YS, and 40YS, respectively) in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the central Oregon Cascade Mountains. We took litter depth measurements and cores to test for the presence of mycorrhizal mats at each sampling location. Denitrification potential was significantly lower in OG than in 5YS, and litter depth, forest floor respiration rate, and concentration of ectomycorrhizal mats were significantly greater in OG than in 5YS. Values were intermediate in 15YS and similar to those measured in OG in 40YS. No significant stand-age differences occurred in soil organic matter, soil moisture, pH, mineralizable N, laboratory soil respiration rate, or extractable ammonium. Sample variability was generally lowest in OG forests and highest in 5YS, and no consistent autocorrelations were observed for any of the variables at lags of 5 m or greater. We found no second-level interactions between stand age and location in ANOVA analyses, suggesting that, within the limits of this study, climate did not influence soil response to disturbance and subsequent recovery; however, several soil properties were affected by site location and, therefore, climate.

AB  - A diverse assemblage of fungi is associated with the litter layer found on the forest floor. Many of these are litter-decomposing fungi, which play a major role as functional decomposers, carbon sequesterers and nutrient immobilizers while also serving as both soil stabilizers and biological remediators. Each year, temperate deciduous forests such as those of northwest Arkansas produce a considerable amount of dead leaves and other types of plant detritus which accumulates on the forest floor. Although it has long been recognized that there is an assemblage of fungi associated with this microhabitat, few studies have been carried out to document the taxa present. The study reported herein represented the first effort of which we are aware to document the fungi associated with forest floor litter in northwest Arkansas. Specimens of fungi collected during the 2016 field season were identified through sequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (nrDNA-ITS). A total of 127 taxa were recorded, the majority of which were clearly associated with dead leaves. Overall, saprophytes were the dominant ecological group, but the total assemblage also included some taxa with other biological roles (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi). {\textcopyright} 2019, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Institute of Plant and Environment Protection.

AB  - Beneficial soil microorganisms are integral to nutrient availability and uptake for plants in restoration. They include mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, together with the soil microbial populations which contribute to nutrient availability. Around 70% of jarrah forest plant species form arbuscular mycorrhizas, and approximately a quarter also form ectomycorrhizas. Many are also legumes. In addition, around 70 orchid species depend on mycorrhizal symbioses. Therefore, symbiotic soil microorganisms are important in the ecosystem. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi recover to pre-mining levels in bauxite restoration in five years. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are poorly adapted to disturbance; however, they are able to reinvade through wind-blown spores. The density of ectomycorrhizal fungi has been found to be equivalent in seven-year-old restoration and adjacent forest, but both abundance and diversity are correlated with development of a litter layer. Fortunately, rhizobia are known to be tolerant of soil disturbance, and failure of N-fixation by legumes has not been reported in restoration. Other N-fixing symbioses, such as between Allocasuarina and Franki a or Macrozamia and Nostoc, have not been investigated in restored mines. Soil microbial biomass C achieves near equivalence after about eight years and appears to be driven by vegetation productivity and related inputs of C into the soil. There is little field evidence that the absence, or very low levels, of soil microbial symbionts will have a substantial impact on plant growth in restoration. Therefore, deliberate reintroduction of these microorganisms does not appear justified. However, soil management to enhance the survival of soil biological components is recommended. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - In forest ecosystems, trees represent the major primary producers and affect the chemical composition and microbial processes in the ecosystem via specific litter chemistry and rhizodeposition. Effects of trees on the abundance of soil microorganisms have been previously observed but the extent to which trees affect the composition of microbial communities remains unknown. Here we analyse the factors affecting the composition of bacterial and fungal communities in forest litter and soil under seven tree species studied at twenty-eight spatially independent sites of similar age developed on the same initial substrate. Microbial communities differed between litter and soil. Bacterial communities were more diverse than fungal communities, especially in litter, and exhibited higher evenness. Eighty percent of the bacterial sequences belonged to the 200-250 most dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and 80\% of the fungal sequences were composed of only 23-28 OTUs. The effect of tree species on the microbial-community composition was significant in both litter and soil for fungi as well as bacteria. In bacteria, the tree effect was likely partly mediated by litter and soil pH. Fungal taxa showed a greater tendency to be tree-specific: 35-37\% of the dominant fungal OTUs but only 0-3\% of the bacterial OTUs were restricted to 1 or 2 trees, and 15-45\% of the fungi and 80\% of the bacteria were common under 6 or 7 trees. Microbial taxa were demonstrated to associate with less trees than would be expected based on the patterns of their abundance in samples and the tree identity thus affects their occurrence. The numbers of observed dominant fungal OTUs in the study area increased faster with an increasing numbers of trees, indicating high beta-diversity. Although the proportion of the arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi differed among trees, the tree-specific fungal taxa were both root-symbiotic and saprotrophic. The effect of trees on the composition of microbial community was demonstrated to be stronger than other soil properties and to explain a large proportion of variation in community composition, especially in fungi.

AB  - Mixtures of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and Acacia mearnsii de Wildeman are twice as productive as E. globulus monocultures growing on the same site in East Gippsland, Victoria, Australia, possibly because of increased nitrogen (N) availability owing to N2 fixation by A. mearnsii. To investigate whether N2 fixation by A. mearnsii could account for the mixed-species growth responses, we assessed N2 fixation by the accretion method and the 15N natural abundance method. Nitrogen gained by E. globulus and A. mearnsii mixtures and monocultures was calculated by the accretion method with plant and soil samples collected 10 years after plantation establishment. Nitrogen in biomass and soil confirmed that A. mearnsii influenced N dynamics. Assuming that the differences in soil, forest floor litter and biomass N of plots containing A. mearnsii compared with E. globulus monocultures were due to N2 fixation, the 10-year annual mean rates of N2 fixation were 38 and 86 kg ha-1 year1 in 1:1 mixtures and A. mearnsii monocultures, respectively. Nitrogen fixation by A. mearnsii could not be quantified on the basis of the natural abundance of 15N because such factors as mycorrhization type and fractionation of N isotopes during N cycling within the plant confounded the effect of the N source on the N isotopic signature of plants. This study shows that A. mearnsii fixed significant quantities of N2 when mixed with E. globulus. A decline in $\delta$15N values of E. globulus and A. mearnsii with time, from 2 to 10 years, is further evidence that N2 was fixed and cycled through the stands. The increased aboveground biomass production of E. globulus trees in mixtures when compared with monocultures can be attributed to increases in N availability. {\textcopyright} 2007 Heron Publishing.

AB  - Dynamics of radiocesium in wild mushrooms, especially in mycorrhizal fungi, in forest ecosystems were investigated for 5 years after the Fukushima nuclear accident, in relation to substrates such as litter, soil and wood debris. Some mushroom species contained a high level of radiocesium in the first or second year, and then the radiocesium content decreased. Changes in radiocesium activities were ambiguous for many other mushrooms. Radiocesium accumulation with time was not common contrary to expectations. Reduction of radiocesium activities in litter and increase in mushrooms and soils, i.e. transfer of radiocesium from litter to mushrooms and soils, was recognized in the first and second year, but it was not obvious in subsequent years. Radiocesium accumulated in several mushroom species, especially in mycorrhizal fungi, while radiocesium in the other mushrooms did not exceed those in the neighboring forest litter. Similar differences in radiocesium level among mushroom species were observed in relation to 40K levels, though 137Cs/40K ratio in mushrooms was lower than in O horizon, but at the same level of the A horizon in general. These facts suggested differences in the mechanisms of cesium accumulation. Residual 137Cs due to nuclear weapons tests or the Chernobyl accident still remained in mushrooms and soils. From the ratio of the past residual 137Cs, it was suggested that the residual 137Cs was tightly retained in the material cycles of forest mushroom ecosystem, whereas 137Cs emitted from the Fukushima accident was still fluid. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Compared with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) forests, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) forests are hypothesized to have higher carbon (C) cycling rates and a more open nitrogen (N) cycle. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized 645 observations, including 22 variables related to below-ground C and N dynamics from 100 sites, where AM and ECM forests co-occurred at the same site. Leaf litter quality was lower in ECM than in AM trees, leading to greater forest floor C stocks in ECM forests. By contrast, AM forests had significantly higher mineral soil C concentrations, and this result was strongly mediated by plant traits and climate. No significant differences were found between AM and ECM forests in C fluxes and labile C concentrations. Furthermore, inorganic N concentrations, net N mineralization and nitrification rates were all higher in AM than in ECM forests, indicating ‘mineral' N economy in AM but ‘organic' N economy in ECM trees. AM and ECM forests show systematic differences in mineral vs organic N cycling, and thus mycorrhizal type may be useful in predicting how different tree species respond to multiple environmental change factors. By contrast, mycorrhizal type alone cannot reliably predict below-ground C dynamics without considering plant traits and climate.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that accretion of microbial turnover products is an important driver for isotopic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) enrichment of soil organic matter (SOM). However, the exact contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to soil isotopic patterns remains unknown. In this study, we compared 13C and 15N patterns of glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), which includes a main fraction derived from AMF, litter, and bulk soil in four temperate rainforests. GRSP was an abundant C and N pool in these forest soils, showing significant 13C and 15N enrichment relative to litter and bulk soil. Hence, cumulative accumulation of recalcitrant AMF turnover products in the soil profile likely contributes to 13C and 15N enrichment in forest soils. Further research on the relationship between GRSP and AMF should clarify the exact extent of this process. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Analysis of a dataset obtained from a monitoring programme at the Heron Wood Reserve (Scotland, UK), focuses on the differences in certain properties of soil and forest litter and patterns of ecosystem dynamics in plots dominated by differing vegetation types, especially the arborescent beech (Fagus sylvatica) and birch (Betula pendula x B. pubescens), and the grass Holcus lanatus. A number of properties show some considerable differences in relation to the habitats dominated by different plant species. For example, pH in the grassland and beech-dominated habitat was significantly lower than in the habitats dominated by birch and mixed vegetation. The highest soil ergosterol was found in the beech-dominated habitat, and it was significantly different from grass and birch dominated habitats. By contrast, the numbers of forest floor layer bacteria in the beech-dominated plots were significantly lower than in the other habitats. Some remarkable differences have also been found as regards forest litter composition and moisture, the community saprotrophs and sheathing mycorrhizas. The ecological patterns are further complicated by animals, and are exemplified here by discussing the role of nutrient inputs due to the mammalian droppings characterised by a succession of the coprophilous mycota. The discussion concentrates on how the dominant plant species influence the patterns of ecological interactions observed. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated the structure of the fungal community of evergreen broad-leaved forests dominated by evergreen oak (Castanopsis sieboldii or Quercus myrsinaefolia) through surveying sporocarps in urban, suburban, and rural areas of the Kanto District, Japan. In a 4 year census, 132 species of fungi were recorded and classified into five groups on the basis of growth substrate: 22 litter decomposers, 39 wood rotters, 10 rotted-wood decomposers, 23 humus decomposers, and 38 ectomycorrhizal species. A long-term survey of fungi revealed lower species richness and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the urban and suburban forest than in the rural forest. The low species diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the urban forest was related to low species richness of Amanitaceae and a high frequency of some Russulaceae species such as Russula japonica. In contrast, species richness and abundance of litter decomposers and wood rotters were higher in the urban forest than in the rural forest. The uneven litter distribution on soil surfaces in the mountainous rural forest may have caused the lower species richness of litter decomposers. Rotted-wood decomposers and humus decomposers showed no significant differences among the three types of forest. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC.

AB  - The impact of ectomycorrhizal fungi or rhizosphere bacteria on tree seedling growth and nutrient uptake is well known. However, few studies have combined those microorganisms in one experiment to clarify their relative contribution and interactions in nutrient acquisition. Here, we monitored the respective contributions of pine roots, two ubiquitous forest ectomycorrhizal fungi Scleroderma citrinum and Laccaria bicolor, and two S. citrinum-mycorrhizosphere bacterial strains of Burkholderia glathei and Collimonas sp., on mineral weathering, nutrient uptake, and plant growth. Pinus sylvestris plants were grown on quartz-biotite substrate and inoculated or not with combinations of mycorrhizal fungi and/or bacterial strains. Magnesium and potassium fluxes were measured and nutrient budgets were calculated. Both ectomycorrhizal fungi significantly increased Mg plant uptake. No significant effects of the two bacterial strains were detected on the K and Mg budgets, but co-inoculating the mycorrhizal fungus S. citrinum and the efficient mineral-weathering B. glathei bacterial strain significantly improved the Mg budget. Similarly, co-inoculating S. citrinum with the Collimonas sp. bacterial strain significantly improved the pine biomass compared to non-inoculated pine plants. In order to better understand this process, we monitored the survival of the inoculated bacterial strains in the quartz-biotite substrate, the pine rhizosphere, and the mycorrhizal niche. The results showed that the two bacterial strains harboured different colonization behaviours both of which depended on the presence of the ectomycorrhizal partner. The populations of the Burkholderia strain were maintained in all these environments with a significantly higher density in the mycorrhizal niche, especially of S. citrinum. In contrast the population of the Collimonas strain reached the detection level except in the treatment inoculated with S. citrinum. These results highlight the need for taking into account the ecology of the microorganisms, and more specifically the fungal-bacterial interactions, when studying mineral weathering and plant nutrition. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Equilibrium and kinetic isotope fractionations during incomplete reactions result in minute differences in the ratio between the two stable N isotopes, N-15 and N-14, in various N pools. In ecosystems such variations (usually expressed in per mil {[}delta(15)N]deviations from the standard atmospheric N-2) depend on isotopic signatures of inputs and outputs, the input-output balance, N transformations and their specific isotope effects, and compartmentation of N within the system. Products along a sequence of reactions, e.g. the N mineralization-N uptake pathway, should, if fractionation factors were equal for the different reactions, become progressively depleted. However, fractionation factors vary. For example, because nitrification discriminates against N-15 in the substrate more than does N mineralization, NH4+ can become isotopically heavier than the organic N from which it is derived. Levels of isotopic enrichment depend dynamically on the stoichiometry of reactions, as well as on specific abiotic and biotic conditions. Thus, the delta(15)N of a specific N pool is not a constant, and delta(15)N of a N compound added to the system is not a conservative, unchanging tracer. This fact, together with analytical problems of measuring 615N in small and dynamic pools of N in the soil-plant system, and the complexity of the N cycle itself (for instance the abundance of reversible reactions), limit the possibilities of making inferences based on observations of N-15 abundance in one or a few pools of N in a system. Nevertheless, measurements of delta(15)N might offer the advantage of giving insights into the N cycle without disturbing the system by adding N-15 tracer. Such attempts require, however, that the complex factors affecting delta(15)N in plants be taken into account, viz. (i) the source(s) of N (soil, precipitation, NOx, NH3, N-2-fixation), (ii) the depth(s) in soil from which N is taken up, (iii) the form(s) of soil-N used (organic N, NH4+, NO3-), (iv) influences of mycorrhizal symbioses and fractionations during and after N uptake by plants, and (v) interactions between these factors and plant phenology. Because of this complexity, data on delta(15)N can only be used alone when certain requirements are met, e.g. when a clearly discrete N source in terms of amount and isotopic signature is studied. For example, it is recommended that N in non-N-2-fixing species should differ more than 5 parts per thousand, from N derived by N-2-fixation, and that several non N-2-fixing references are used, when data on delta(15)N are used to estimate N-2-fixation in poorly described ecosystems. As well as giving information on N source effects, delta(15)N can give insights into N cycle rates. For example, high levels of N deposition onto previously N-limited systems leads to increased nitrification, which produces N-15- enriched NH4+ and N-15-depleted NO3-. As many forest plants prefer NH4+ they become enriched in N-15 in such circumstances. This change in plant delta(15)N Will subsequently also occur in the soil surface horizon after litter-fall, and might be a useful indicator of N saturation, especially since there is usually an increase in delta(15)N With depth in soils of N-limited forests. Generally, interpretation of N-15 measurements requires additional independent data and modelling, and benefits from a controlled experimental setting. Modelling will be greatly assisted by the development of methods to measure the delta(15)N of small dynamic pools of N in soils. Direct comparisons with parallel low tracer level N-15 studies will be necessary to further develop the interpretation of variations in delta(15)N in soil-plant systems. Another promising approach is to study ratios of N-15:N-14 together with other pairs of stable isotopes, e.g. C-13:C-12 or O-18:O-16, in the same ion or molecules. This approach can help to tackle the challenge of distinguishing isotopic source effects from fractionations within the system studied.

AB  - Assessing the Impact of the Rise in CO2: A doubling of the present atmospheric CO2 concentration is likely to occur by the end of the next century and will have many effects on trees and forests. There may be major changes in climate, especially temperature and precipitation, that will affect the growth and ecology of trees and forests: there will be substantial effects on the growth and ecology of trees and forests as a result of the direct effects of CO2 on the physiology of trees. To a considerable extent the consequences of an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration on climate are speculative, whereas many of the direct effects of an increase in CO2 concentration on the physiology and growth of plants have been established through experimentation and are quite well known and understood. There are several reasons for showing active concern about the consequences of the rise in CO2 concentration for trees and forests: to enhance knowledge, at a fundamental level, about the functioning of woodlands and forests; to assess the likely impact on their ecology, productivity and value; and to anticipate any significant downstream, socio-economic consequences. The consequences of the rise in CO2 concentration may be assessed at a range of temporal and spatial scales: from seconds to centuries, from cell to region. Biological information about the effects of CO2 on plants is generally available at short time scales and small spatial scales, whereas ecological and socio-economic concern is largely expressed with respect to the much larger scales of the stand and the forest over tens or hundreds of years. There are major problems with the data currently available. The environmental conditions pertaining in the majority of the experiments (e.g. soil type, temperature) differ significantly from forest conditions throughout the boreal and temperate regions. Secondly, the use of juvenile trees in growth cabinets and rooms makes extrapolation to the field situation difficult. Finally, the use to pot-grown plants with a limited soil volume, and all the problems of nutrient depletion that this entails, imposes severe constraints on the interpretations of changes in plant nutrient contents, assimilation rates and growth. Photosynthesis and Stomatal Action: The primary role of CO2 as a substrate for photosynthesis is well understood and there are no reasons to suppose that effects of CO2 concentration on the primary carboxylation are any different in trees from other plants with the C3 pathway. However, the role of CO2 as an effective activator and regulator of rubisco is only currently being unravelled. In general, photosynthesis increases substantially, but less than proportionately (up to 75%), in response to a doubling in ambient CO2 concentration, but a lack of response, or even a reduction in rate of photosynthesis, has been observed. There is increasing evidence that maintenance of active sinks for assimilate is necessary for the effective stimulation of photosynthesis by an increase in CO2 concentration. Constrained rooting of pot-grown trees and the lack of alternative sinks as a result of determinate growth, may be the reason why a strong, positive response has not always been seen and why the assimilation rate declines with time in many of the experiments. Closure of stomata in response to stress may also negate the increase from CO2 fertilization. When plants are grown for extended periods in elevated CO2 so that they may become acclimated, the increase in rate of photosynthesis is less than in short-term experiments. Analysis of A/Ci response functions indicates that this may result from a reduction in the activity of rubisco, although it is not clear whether the amount or the activation state of the enzyme is reduced, or from Pi limitation. Stomatal conductance generally declines with an increase in CO2 concentration to between 0 to 70% of the control. There is considerable variation in response and in some trees, particularly conifers, stomatal conductance is rather unresponsive to changes in ambient CO2 concentration. The lack of a mechanistic understanding of the role of CO2 in stomatal action prevents explanation at present. There is some evidence that a reduction in the number of stomata per unit area or per unit epidermal cell may also contribute to the reduction in stomatal conductance of plants grown at high CO2 concentrations, but both increases and decreases have been observed in trees. It is not clear whether these changes are the result of acclimation of developmental processes, ecological selection or genetic adaptation. There may be other presently unknown effects of CO2 concentration on growth processes at the cellular level. In particular, the effects of CO2 concentration on leaf growth may not be explicable solely in terms of substrate supply and there may be effects of CO2 on leaf initiation, development and expansion in other ways. Tree Growth: Growth of seedlings and young trees of both broadleaves and conifers is increased by a doubling of the ambient CO2 concentration. The observed magnitude of the response ranges from 20 to 120% with a median of ca 40%. Both root and shoot growth are increased. Young trees grow faster in high CO2 but normal ontogenetic processes occur. In general, the experiments suffer from a number of inadequacies and this may explain the variability of response. In particular nearly all the experiments have been short-term (less than 12 months) on very young trees, that are often pot-bound and with growth restricted by lack of sinks and in a nutrient-deficient condition. Very low relative growth rates indicate far from good growth conditions. Increases in growth in response to increase in CO2 concentration occur in stress conditions and can ameliorate to a large extent the influence of stresses (water, nutrient, low light) on growth. Nutrient deficiency enhances biomass partitioning to the roots, whereas with free nutrient supply, an increase in CO2 concentration leads to a relative enhancement of leaf growth. Acclimation to nutrient depletion, evident as increased nutrient use efficiency, may occur but its extent and long-term significance remains uncertain. Enhanced fine-root mass and increased mycorrhizal infection may be significant in this respect, in addition to changes in root uptake processes. The combination of enhanced assimilation and reduced stomatal condutance at elevated CO2 leads to an increase in water use efficiency at the leaf and seedling scales in controlled environments, but it is not known whether this occurs at the stand scale in the field. Because trees are perennial, a small increase in relative growth rate of 0.1% per day, at the prevailing low growth rates in many of the experiments, should lead to a large difference in individual tree size after a number of years. Whether CO2 fertilization will have this effect is however, uncertain. A major gap in our knowledge is related to the influence of elevated CO2 levels on yield quality (wood density, knottiness, etc.). Stand Processes and Production: The experimental approach is not practical with older trees, stands and forests. The effects of CO2 on assimilation, water use and other processes at the stand or larger scales, can only be assessed through models. Models of stand processes in relation to a doubling of CO2 concentration, taking into account acclimation to CO2 at the leaf scale, indicate a substantial increase in stand CO2-assimilation and in water use efficiency. However, the information available to parameterize such models may not be appropriate because it has been derived from seedlings that were only partially acclimated. Experimentation on mature trees is technically feasible but logistically and financially difficult. A more feasible approach available may be to use portions of mature trees, such as branches, in large cuvettes to obtain data required for the parameterization of stand-scale models that are used to make predictions of the likely consequences of the increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration for stand functioning. Micro-meteorological changes within the cuvettes and changes in feedback loops between the enclosed portion and the atmosphere, must, of course, be taken into account as well as the physiological consequences of treating only part of the plant. Such models require to be carefully tested at the present CO2 concentration and in relation to other environmental variables, since they cannot be tested in a doubled CO2 environment in forests. Changes in tree canopy structure may also influence canopy functioning as well as understorey species composition and growth: changes in the pattern of branching and in internode length, as a result of enhanced CO2 concentrations, have been observed, for example. However, models that include feedbacks such as interactions between CO2 and crown structure, growth and respiration of trees, or leaf composition and rates of litter decomposition, are not presently available. Whether changes in harvest index and wood quality will ensue at the stand scale cannot be predicted at present. Forest and Region: At larger scales, a very complex network of processes must be taken into consideration and there is quite insufficient information about the effects of CO2 on these processes to permit reasonable predictions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Conversion of tropical forests into intensely managed plantations is a threat to ecosystem functions. On Sumatra, Indonesia, oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations are rapidly expanding, displacing rain forests and extensively used rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforests. Here, we tested the influence of land use systems on root traits including chemical traits (carbon, nitrogen, mineral nutrients, potentially toxic elements [aluminium, iron] and performance traits (root mass, vitality, mycorrhizal colonization). Traits were measured as root community-weighed traits (RCWTs) in lowland rain forests, in rubber agro-forests mixed with rain forest trees, in rubber and oil palm plantations in two landscapes (Bukit Duabelas and Harapan, Sumatra). We hypothesized that RCWTs vary with land use system indicating increasing transformation intensity and loss of ecosystem functions. The main factors found to be related to increasing transformation intensity were declining root vitality and root sulfur, nitrogen, carbon, manganese concentrations and increasing root aluminium and iron concentrations as well as increasing spore densities of arbuscular mycorrhizas. Mycorrhizal abundance was high for arbuscular and low for ectomycorrhizas and unrelated to changes in RCWTs. The decline in RCWTs showed significant correlations with soil nitrogen, soil pH and litter carbon. Thus, our study uncovered a relationship between deteriorating root community traits and loss of ecosystem functionality and showed that increasing transformation intensity resulted in decreasing root nutrition and health. Based on these results we suggest that land management that improves root vitality may enhance the ecological functions of intense tropical production systems. {\textcopyright} 2015 Sahner et al.

AB  - Previous research from the tropics indicates that AMF may be well adapted to organic soils and even represent the dominant mycorrhizal form, though the extraradical part of the symbiosis was omitted as in most other tropical studies. Our study aims at characterizing the extraradical part of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in a highly organic tropical montane forest soil in Southern Ecuador. Based on recent studies on the interaction of AM fungal hyphae and litter we hypothesized that within the organic layer AM hyphae grow in close contact with decomposing material. To test this idea, AM fungal hyphal distribution in the organic layer was determined by directly staining roots and decomposing leaves and extracting hyphae from the remaining particulate organic material. AM and non-AM fungal hyphae were analyzed, as well as root colonization patterns. Our results showed that AMF indeed represented the dominant mycorrhizal form with an average root colonization of 43\%. The extraradical AM hyphal length ranged from 2 to 34 m g(-1) soil with a mean of 10.4 m g(-1) soil (equals 3.1 m cm(-3) soil), and therefore exceeded root length about 13-fold. As hypothesized, 29\% of AM extraradical hyphae were closely attached to decomposing leaves. These hyphae were mainly located at the leaf surface, though in some parts leaf veins and inner leaf tissues were colonized. More than half of AM hyphal biomass was detected on the root surface, a pattern potentially driven by the predominant Paris-type AMP. Non-AM fungal hyphae colonized decomposing material to a significantly greater extent, though hyphal length attached to roots was equal. This study supports the adaptation of AMF to highly organic soils in the tropics and the existence of a widespread extraradical mycelium, which is not readily detectable by standard methods. The close association with decomposing leaves most likely improves direct nutrient uptake from decomposed material and points to a potential indirect contribution of AMF to the decomposition process.

AB  - Forests around the world are increasingly fragmented, and edge effects on forest microclimates have the potential to affect ecosystem functions such as carbon and nutrient cycling. Edges tend to be drier and warmer due to the effects of insolation, wind, and evapotranspiration and these gradients can penetrate hundreds of metres into the forest. Litter decomposition is a key component of the carbon cycle, which is largely controlled by saprotrophic fungi that respond to variation in temperature and moisture. However, the impact of forest fragmentation on litter decay is poorly understood. Here, we investigate edge effects on the decay of wood in a temperate forest using an experimental approach, whereby mass loss in wood blocks placed along 100 m transects from the forest edge to core was monitored over 2 years. Decomposition rate increased with distance from the edge, and was correlated with increasing humidity and moisture content of the decaying wood, such that the decay constant at 100 m was nearly twice that at the edge. Mean air temperature decreased slightly with distance from the edge. The variation in decay constant due to edge effects was larger than that expected from any reasonable estimates of climatic variation, based on a published regional model. We modelled the influence of edge effects on the decay constant at the landscape scale using functions for forest area within different distances from edge across the UK. We found that taking edge effects into account would decrease the decay rate by nearly one quarter, compared with estimates that assumed no edge effect. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can colonize the roots of a large number of plant species and individuals, simultaneously creating a network of hyphae connecting the roots of many plants. In this study, I examined the effect of the mycorrhizal network produced by conspecific and heterospecific adult plants on growth and nutrient content of seedlings of Arisaema triphyllum (L.) Schott. and Maianthemum racemosum (L.) Link ssp. racemosum. Seedlings of both plant species were planted so that they could become colonized by the mycorrhizal network or remain uncolonized, and were planted in the presence of a conspecific or heterospecific adult plant. After 2 years of growth, seedlings were harvested and biomass and nutrient content were determined. Biomass of A. triphyllum seedlings was not affected by the identity of the adult plant or colonization by mycorrhizal fungi. Biomass of M. racemosum seedlings was significantly affected by adult plant identity and mycorrhizal colonization. Maianthemum racemosum seedlings grown near a conspecific adult were significantly larger than when grown near a heterospecific adult, and mycorrhizal M. racemosum seedlings grown near a heterospecific adult had significantly less biomass than nonmycorrhizal seedlings. This suggests that the mycorrhizal network of some plants may confer positive or negative effects on mycorrhizal seedlings as compared to nonmycorrhizal seedlings.

AB  - Positive relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are reported in many studies. The underlying mechanisms are, however, only little understood, likely due to the focus on the aboveground system and neglecting species-specific traits. We used different clusters of tree species composition to investigate how tree species diversity and tree species identity affect belowground nematode communities. Since soil nematodes comprise different trophic groups and are strongly linked to the microbial community, results can provide insight on how soil food webs are structured. In addition, data on leaf litter and fine root biomass were included to account for different effects of aboveground and belowground resources. Clusters of three trees of one, two and three species were identified within a temperate deciduous forest. Target tree species were European beech (Fagus sylvatica), common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and lime (Tilia cordata, T. platyphyllos) differing in physiology, leaf litter quality and type of mycorrhiza. Tree species identity strongly affected nematode trophic structure, whereas tree Species diversity had no impact. Ash beneficially affected bacterial-feeding nematodes, whereas fungal feeders were suppressed, likely caused by ash litter increasing soil pH. Fostering of the bacterial food chain by ash additionally could be related to rhizodeposition gaining importance after disappearance of high quality ash litter in spring, highlighting seasonal shifts in root and leaf litter-derived resources. The negative effect of ash on fungal-feeding nematodes is suggested to be due to the lack of ectomycorrhizal fungi as ash roots only form arbuscular mycorrhiza. In contrast, beech benefited fungal feeders and detrimentally affected bacterial feeders due to more acidic soil conditions that increase the competitive strength of fungi. Lime tended to negatively impact total nematode density but positively influenced plant-feeding nematodes. Generally, beech and ash strongly but opposingly influenced the trophic structure of nematode communities suggesting that changes in tree species identity result in major shifts in the channeling of energy through decomposer food webs. The results indicate that the structure of soil food webs varies markedly with tree species and point to the importance of basal resources, i.e., leaf litter and rhizodeposits. This suggests bottom-up forces mediated by individual tree species to control major decomposition pathways rather than tree diversity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We manipulated the number of saprotrophic fungi in either a complex multi-resource substratum (sterilized forest soil), or a single-resource substratum (powdered cellulose). The substrates were inoculated with five common species of soil fungi in all possible combinations (from monocultures to five species in combination). In both substrates, the rate of organic matter decomposition was positively associated with species richness. The effect of fungal diversity was much stronger in the uniform single-resource substrate (r2 = 0.455, P < 0.0001) than in soil (r2 = 0.154, P < 0.0001). The results document that species richness of microbial decomposers strongly affects decomposition processes, at least at the species poor end of the diversity gradient. Both, 'sampling effect' and 'species complementarity effect' contributed to the community response with the latter being much more pronounced in uniform substrate than in soil. This indicates that facilitative interactions are more important than resource partitioning for positive effects of species richness. {\textcopyright}2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.

AB  - Dry forest restoration success could be strongly dependent on the re-establishment of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities. AM fungi directly influence growth of a great variety of plant species by increasing nutrient uptake and providing a network of nutrient distribution for the whole plant community. Our study focuses on how different ecological restoration techniques could influence AM fungal communities in restored dry forests in the Brazilian Caatinga. The study was conducted at the National Forest of A{\c{c}}u, northeastern Brazil. AM fungal communities were studied in a restoration experiment studying the effects of litter transposition, irrigation and agroforestry treatments in comparison with a control (no manipulation) and samples collected from a conserved area (Caatinga pristine woodland) and in a regeneration area (herbaceous vegetation). Total abundance of glomerospores, number of viable glomerospores, species richness and species composition of glomerospore communities were compared among all conditions. We also investigated how soil nutrients could relate to the number of viable glomerospores in the restoration treatments. Litter treatment was the most effective in improving the AM fungal communities, showing a higher number of glomerospores than the control treatment. Litter treatment also had a greater species similarity to the conserved area among all treatments. Irrigation lead to an increase in soil salinization, which was related to a decrease in glomerospore abundance. However, in the highly irrigated agroforestry treatment there was an increase in the abundance of viable glomerospores in relation to the control treatment. Organic matter and calcium were positively correlated with the number of viable glomerospores while sodium was negatively related, showing that soil salinity could affect AM fungal community structure. Our study shows that litter transposition and agroforestry treatments are promising techniques to re-establish mycorrhizal communities during dry forest restoration. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - The effects of two year's addition of simulated acid precipitation, with and without added fertilizer, on mycorrhizae, litter decomposition and soil and tree chemistry in a sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) dominated forest were investigated. The forest floor beneath mature sugar maple trees was irrigated at monthly intervals between May and September with local lake water acidified to pH 3, pH 4 or untreated lakewater of pH 4.9. In addition, a commercial organic slow-release fertilizer (Maple Gro) was added to the soil prior to irrigation with pH 3 spray. Trees to which no experimental spray was applied were also included as controls. Eight trees were used for each of the five treatments. Application of the acid spray alone did not acidify surface soil nor cause visible symptoms of decline in trees. The pH of the soil solution and soil leachate was increased by addition of acidified lakewater. An increase in the concentration of sulphate (SO42-), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) in soil leachate was only recorded in plots irrigated with water acidified to pH 3 + Maple Gro. The initial rate of litter decomposition tended to be higher following application of the acid sprays, although mycorrhizal infection of sugar maple roots was reduced in the pH 3 and pH 4 treatments. Concentrations of zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) were highest in wood formed during the period irrigated with water acidified to pH 3. Foliar nitrogen (N) concentrations tended to be higher in all irrigated treatments, although there were no differences between treatment in any of the other nutrients measured in foliage after two years of treatment. It is concluded that the application of simulated acid rain under field conditions results in a complex interaction of events which are not reproduced in pot trials and must be fully understood before the impact of acid rain on sugar maple forests can be evaluated.

AB  - Gondwanan vegetation, and the Australian region in particular, is species rich for ectomycorrhizal fungi in epigeous and hypogeous forms with over 100 species recorded in small (1 ha) patches of forests. Distinguishing co-occurring ectomycorrhizal fungi as root associations in native (natural or wildlands) vegetation or plantations and discriminating them from other larger basidiomycetes, e.g. wood and leaf litter decomposer fungi, places large demands on molecular identification, especially if interspecific similarities and intraspecific variation occur in target sequences. One hundred and nine species of larger basidiomycetes from a single forest location were characterised by PCR-RFLP profiles of two genomic regions (nuclear rDNA ITS and mtLSU). Over one-third of the species for which multiple isolates were tested showed intraspecific variation in either one or both genomic regions. This remarkably high variation questions previous assumptions about intraspecific ITS sequence variation and highlights the value of integrated molecular and morphological databases including voucher specimens. It also emphasises the value of molecular investigations that use more than one genomic region. Interspecific similarities were common among the Cortinariaceae, especially in the ITS region. Discrimination of most Cortinariaceae species was achieved using variation in the mtLSU region in conjunction with the ITS. This new information raises the possibilities that the ITS sequence is more conserved and the mtLSU more variable than among species of the other 23 families. In the other families, interspecific ITS variation was greater and the mtLSU profiles grouped species within families. The high variation in the two genomic regions indicated possible differences in the fungal population structure between two adjacent, differently managed blocks of Eucalyptus marginata forest. The significance of this variation to ecology, biodiversity assessment and ecosystem management are discussed.

AB  - The fungal community in coniferous forest soils plays a pivotal role in ecosystem processes such as decomposition and carbon and nutrient cycling. Both saprotrophic (SP) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi occur throughout the upper soil horizons in coniferous forests and could therefore be exposed to high concentrations of monoterpenes occurring in the needle litter and roots of some tree species. Previous work has noted the differential effects of monoterpenes on the mycelial growth of a range of both SP and ECM fungi when grown in artificial nutrient media. This study used a novel experimental system to assess the effect of environmentally relevant concentrations of monoterpenes on the activity of ECM and SP fungi grown on more natural substrata. Exposure of the ECM fungus Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr. to vapours of either $\alpha$-pinene or $\beta$-pinene resulted in a significantly greater proportion of root tips being colonised by the fungus when it was grown with seedlings of Picea abies (L.) Karst. Exposure to monoterpenes resulted in a significant decrease in respiration rate of two species of litter degrading SP fungi, Mycena galopus var. candida J. E. Lange and Collybia butyracea (Bull.) P. Kumm. There was no difference in response between the two SP species, despite the fact that previous tests in liquid nutrient media, with monoterpenes at higher concentrations, indicated that one species was sensitive and one was not. The high volatility and low solubility of monoterpenes in water make them challenging to work with. The experimental system developed here, although still artificial, provides a bridge between pure culture studies in defined media and all the complexities of forest soils in the field, by allowing the exposure of fungi to environmentally relevant monoterpene concentrations in more natural substrata. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We used natural abundance C-13:C-12 (delta C-13) and 8 yr of labeling with C-13-depleted CO2 in a Pinus taeda Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment to investigate carbon sources of saprotrophic fungi, ectomycorrhizal fungi, and fungi of uncertain life history. Sporocarp delta C-13 identified Sistotrema confluens as ectomycorrhizal, as suspected previously from morphological characteristics. Saprotrophic delta C-13 declined by 2 parts per thousand-13 parts per thousand between ambient to elevated CO2 treatments and corresponded to different carbon sources, including surface litter (Rhodocollybia, Mycena), pine cones (Baeospora), wood (Gymnopilus, Pholiota), and soil (Ramariopsis). Ectomycorrhizal fungi, foliage, and surficial litter declined 12 parts per thousand in delta C-13 between ambient and elevated treatments, confirming that these fungi depend on recent photosynthate. The delta C-13 of ectomycorrhizal genera correlated between treatments with a slope (4.3 +/- 1.2) greater than the expected value of one. This suggested that Inocybe and Cortinarius incorporated some pre-treatment, soil-derived carbon (presumably from amino acids) whereas Lactarius and Russula only incorporated current-year photosynthate or recent, litter-derived carbon. Combining natural abundance and tracer C-13 measurements proved a powerful technique to examine carbon sources of different fungi. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

The research was started in 2011 and Syktyvkar city and its vicinity were selected as key areas (61°40'N, 50°49'E). The study area is located in the northeast of the European part of Russia in the middle taiga. 267 species and intraspecific taxa of the agaricoid basidiomycetes from 75 genera, 26 families and five orders were identified. 114 species are reported for Syktyvkar city and its vicinity for the first time, 73 species - for the Komi Republic for the first time. Four species (Phaeolepiota aurea, Cortinarius violaceus, Lepista nuda, Gyroporus cyanescens) are included in the Red Book of the Komi Republic. 218 species were found in forest habitats; mycorrhizal fungi, saprotrophic on wood and on litter prevailed among them. 53 species were registered in parks and lawns; saprotrophic on humus, on wood and mycorrhizal fungi prevailed among them. 17 species of agaricoid basidiomycetes mainly from the group of saprotrophic on humus were noted from meadows. An annotated list of identified species of agaricoid basidiomycetes growing in Syktyvkar and vicinity is given in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2017 Russian Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal short roots, mycelia, rhizomorphs and mats from conifer soil were examined in relation to their hydrophobic properties. In some cases connected fruit bodies were included in the study. Mycorrhizal soils gathered from the forest and/or colonized in a laboratory rhizoscope were studied, as were mycelia in pure culture. Most forest-derived species were hydrophobic. The drought-resistant Cenococcum geophilum and the more ruderal and moisture-dependent Thelephora terrestris were both strongly hydrophilic. The hydrophobic mycelium seemed solely responsible for the water repellence properties, and adjacent soil and plant debris remained unaffected and hydrophilic. In hydrophobic fungi, mat formation was induced in the rhizoscope by hyphal contact with alder litter leaves. This stimulating effect was not found when the leaves were covered by water or when fresh, green alder leaves were used. Thelephora terrestris did not form such mats in vitro and spread sparsely in air pockets as well as in the adjacent water film. The possibility is discussed that many mycorrhizal fungi in the forest may partly control their soil environment via aeration created by their hydrophobia. {\textcopyright} 1991 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Given the wide range of factors influencing soil microbial communities, the aim of our study was to investigate how these communities respond to changes in plant inputs, litter, and removal of soil organic layers, in a subalpine forest. Our study site was located on the slopes of Yulong Snow Mountain, Yunnan, China. We analyzed the effect of litter, tree roots, and the organic horizon on soil microbial communities, using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and by monitoring any changes in soil properties, over two months. Our results showed that the gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria ratio (G+/G-), after the second month of all treatments, was significantly higher than after the first month of treatment. The biomass of the soil microbial community is sensitive to response to variation of the soil environment. Removal of the organic horizon and additional litter coverage significantly decreased the biomass of fungi, fungi/bacteria and total PLFA, and significantly increased the G+/G- ratio compared with the control and other treatments after two months. Organic horizon and litter layer removal significantly increased the G+/G- ratio. Litter removal significantly increased the biomass of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Contrary to our expectations, root removal had no effect on the biomass of the soil microbial communities during two months' treatment. {\textcopyright} Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences.

AB  - A study was made in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve of niche differentiation among 11 woody species that have very small seeds (22-460 mu g) and establish in deep shade, i.e., where the indirect site factor (isf) under cloudy conditions is less than or equal to 2\%, and one taxonomically related light-demander (seed mass 33 mu g). Comparative observations were made on changing light requirement with age. The species varied from shrubs and treelets (Urophyllum) via small to medium-height trees (Ficus, Pternandra) to tall trees (Gynotroches and Pellacalyx). In general, the shorter species fruited in deep shade while the taller needed direct irradiance. All produced ripe fruit at least once a year. In 1-3\% isf seedling mortality over II months was 24\% for Urophyllum hirsutum and 57\% for Pternandra echinata (two strongly shade-tolerant species); survivors produced appreciable new stem and leaf tissue. For two more light-demanding species (Ficus grossularioides and F. fistulosa) mean lamina area was much larger in small gaps (10\% isf) than in the understorey (< 3\% isf), while for Urophyllum hirsutum it was much smaller. These three species showed the greatest difference in SLA. Then were few significant intraspecific differences between gaps and understorey in concentrations of N, P or K. In a valley where there was no significant difference in isf between a path and adjacent understorey, seedlings of species with seeds < 1 mg mean dry mass were five times as dense on transects along steep pathside banks as in the understorey 5 m upslope. The mean mid-bank slope was 66 degrees (cf. 20 degrees upslope). On mid-bank transects litter had a cover of 36\% (cf. 95\% upslope), and was thinner (0.8 vs 3.2 cm). The soil at 0-7 cm depth into the mid-bank had much lower concentrations of organic matter, total N and P (but not total K) and fine roots than that of upslope transects. All species were found to have vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza when 1-2 m tall in deep shade, several having very dense infections. Seedling form and responses are discussed in relation to potential adaptive value and possible evolutionary origin.

AB  - Organic horizons of old-growth Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] forests are colonized by ectomycorrhizal fungi, which can form large patches or mats. Respiration, N mineralization, chitinase activity, and amino sugar C and N turnover are higher in soils colonized by ectomycorrhizal mats. To test if microbial activity in mat soil is driven by decomposition of fungal biomass, we incubated mat and non-mat soil with 13C 15N-labeled, chitinenriched fungal cell wall material. Cell wall material was readily decomposed during 22-d incubations in both soils, and cell-wall-derived 13C and 15N were traced into mineralized pools, extractable organic pools, microbial biomass, and microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Basal microbial activity was higher in mat soils. Although total respiration was higher in mat soils with cell walls added, more cell wall C was mineralized in non-mat than mat soils; this was inferred to reflect greater preferential respiration of cell wall C over soil organic matter (SOM). Mineralization of N from cell wall material was low, with no difference between soils, and positive priming of N mineralization from SOM occurred after 3 wk. Both the proportion of cell wall N assimilated and N growth yield efficiency (GYE) were higher than for cell wall C. The relative abundance of fungi was higher in cell-wall-amended soils, and cellwall- derived 13C was found in fungal and Gram-negative bacterial PLFAs. Cell wall C assimilation and C GYE were higher in mat soils, which could be linked to greater mineralization of SOM or to differential activity of select microbial taxonomic groups. Chitin-rich fungal cell wall material was utilized as both a microbial N and C source; N was predominantly assimilated and C was predominantly metabolized. It is possible that fungal necromass may contribute to N stabilization in these soils. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Soil Science Society of America, Inc.

AB  - Though typically discussed in the context of salinity, a shortage of sodium in tropical forests has been demonstrated in recent years, inhibiting soil biota with impacts on decomposition processes (Sodium Ecosystem Respiration hypothesis). So far, sodium limitation has been shown for soil fauna, whereas a potential role in saprotrophic fungi remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that fungi have sodium demands at low levels resulting in reduced activity in tropical soils, analyzing fungal responses to sodium availability. Despite careful experimentation and the usage of different fungal strains we did not find evidence for fungal sodium demands using controlled nutrient media, not even in the absence of potassium. Likewise, there was no significant fungal response to sodium additions in litter samples, though decomposition rates were positively affected. These findings suggest that sodium is not essential for osmoregulation of tested fungal strains, which are hence not affected by sodium limitation.

AB  - Fungal colonization of litter has been described mostly in terms of fructification succession in the decomposition process or the process of fungal ligninolysis. No studies have been conducted on litter colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and their relationship with the presence of saprotrophic fungi. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationships that exist in simultaneous leaf litter colonization by AMF and saprotrophic fungi and the relationships between rates of litter and associated root colonization by AMF at different soil depths. We selected Eugenia sp. and Syzygium sp. in a riparian tropical forest, with an abundant production of litter (O horizon), we evaluated litter and root colonization at different depths, its C:N ratios, and the edaphic physico-chemical parameters of the A horizon immediately below the litter layer. Litter colonization by saprotrophic fungi and AMF increased with depth, but the saprotrophic fungal colonization of some litter fragments decreased in the lowermost level of the litter while AMF litter colonization continued to increase. Plant roots were present only in the middle and bottom layers, but their mycorrhizal colonization did not correlate with litter colonization. The external hyphae length of AMF is abundant (ca. 20 m g(-1) sample) and, in common with sample humidity, remained constant with increasing depth. We conclude that in zones of riparian tropical forest with abundant sufficient litter accumulation and abundant AMF external hyphae,, the increase in litter colonization by AMF with depth correlates to the colonization by saprotrophic fungi, but their presence in the deepest layers is independent of both litter colonization by saprotrophic fungi and root colonization by AMF.

AB  - Roots promote the formation of slow-cycling soil carbon (C), yet we have a limited understanding of the magnitude and controls on this flux. We hypothesised arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)- and ectomycorrhizal (ECM)-associated trees would exhibit differences in root-derived C accumulation in the soil, and that much of this C would be transferred into mineral-associated pools. We installed $\delta$13C-enriched ingrowth cores across mycorrhizal gradients in six Eastern U.S. forests (n = 54 plots). Overall, root-derived C was 54% greater in AM versus ECM-dominated plots. This resulted in nearly twice as much root-derived C in putatively slow-cycling mineral-associated pools in AM compared to ECM plots. Given that our estimates of root-derived inputs were often equal to or greater than leaf litter inputs, our results suggest that variation in root-derived soil C accumulation due to tree mycorrhizal dominance may be a key control of soil C dynamics in forests. {\textcopyright} 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - 1. Plant roots and their mycorrhizal symbionts are critical components of forest ecosystems, being largely responsible for soil resource acquisition by plants and the maintenance of soil structure, as well as influencing soil nutrient cycling. Silvicultural treatments should be guided by knowledge of how these below-ground components respond to different forest management practices. 2. We examined the cumulative effects of 20 years of prescribed burning at 2-year intervals. We measured fine root length density and fine root and mycorrhizal root biomass in the upper 15 cm of mineral soil in a south-western ponderosa pine forest over a complete burn cycle. 3. Repeated burning reduced fine root length, fine root biomass and mycorrhizal root biomass, as well as the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus stored in these below-ground pools. 4. Estimates of fine root production, fine root decomposition and nutrient dynamics were similar in burned and control plots. 5. Synthesis and applications. Although repeated-prescribed fire may be an effective, low-cost approach for reducing fuel loads and lessening the chance of a catastrophic wildfire in ponderosa pine forests, our results suggest that this strategy may negatively affect below-ground biomass pools and nutrient cycling processes in the long term. We recommend that mechanical reductions in fuel loads be conducted in these and similar forests that have not experienced fire for decades, before fire is reintroduced as a management tool. {\textcopyright} 2005 British Ecological Society.

AB  - Increased soil nitrogen (N) from atmospheric N deposition could change microbial communities and functions. However, the underlying mechanisms and whether soil phosphorus (P) status are responsible for these changes still have not been well explained. Here, we investigated the effects of N and P additions on soil bacterial and fungal communities and predicted their functional compositions in a temperate forest. We found that N addition significantly decreased soil bacterial diversity in the organic (O) horizon, but tended to increase bacterial diversity in the mineral (A) horizon soil. P addition alone did not significantly change soil bacterial diversity but mitigated the negative effect of N addition on bacterial diversity in the O horizon. Neither N addition nor P addition significantly influenced soil fungal diversity. Changes in soil microbial community composition under N and P additions were mainly due to the shifts in soil pH and NO3− contents. N addition can affect bacterial functional potentials, such as ureolysis, N fixation, respiration, decomposition of organic matter processes, and fungal guilds, such as pathogen, saprotroph, and mycorrhizal fungi, by which more C probably was lost in O horizon soil under increased N deposition. However, P addition can alleviate or switch the effects of increased N deposition on the microbial functional potentials in O horizon soil and may even be a benefit for more C sequestration in A horizon soil. Our results highlight the different responses of microorganisms to N and P additions between O and A horizons and provides an important insight for predicting the changes in forest C storage status under increasing N deposition in the future. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Increases in carbon (C) inputs can augment soil organic matter (SOM), or reduce SOM by accelerating decomposition. Thus, there is a need to understand how and why ecosystems differ in their sensitivity to C inputs. Invasive plants that invade wide-ranging habitats, accumulate biomass rapidly, and contribute copious amounts of C to soil can be ideal for addressing this gap. We quantified the effects of the invasive C4 grass, Microstegium vimineum, on SOM in three temperate forests across plots varying in their relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) versus ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees. We hypothesized that invasion would differentially affect SOM along the mycorrhizal gradient owing to recognized patterns in nitrogen availability (AM > ECM) and the proportion of unprotected SOM (ECM > AM). Across all sites, M. vimineum was associated with lower particulate organic matter (POM) in ECM-dominated plots, consistent with our hypothesis that invader-derived C inputs should stimulate decomposers to acquire nitrogen from unprotected SOM in soils with low nitrogen availability. However, the pattern of lower POM in the ECM-dominated soils was offset by greater mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM)—and isotopic data suggest this was largely driven by native- rather than invader-derived SOM—implying an invasion-associated transfer of native-derived POM into MAOM. Our results demonstrate a context-dependent shift in the form of SOM in a system with presumably enhanced C inputs. This finding suggests a need to look beyond changes in total SOM stocks, as intrinsic SOM changes could lead to important long-term feedbacks on invasion or priming effects. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In four permanent plots of the Tai National Park in Ivory Coast the fungal populations of the litter and of the soil, the mycorrhizae and the chemical characteristics of the soil, during the recovery of the forest, are examined.The lists of the species in each one of the natural and cultivated plots, the coefficients of similarity according to Sorensen and the indices of diversity according to Shannon, allow us to verify interesting phenomena. In fact, in cultivated plots, the fungal community, because of the reappearance of characteristic species of the natural forest, is evolving towards conditions similar to those previous to the cultivations.Considering the Tai forest as a climax community, the fungal microflora seems to belong to a climax association that, if disturbed, has the ability to recover fast through a regular succession.In a more general way the ability to recover of the environment is pointed out and this let us hope for the possibility to prolong the period of the shifting cultivation, without compromising the conservation of the forest. {\textcopyright} Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Data on the impact of forest management practices on ectomycorrhizal community structure remains fragmentary and mainly originates from studies in northern coniferous forests. This study focuses on a comparison of ectomycorrhizal communities between canopy gaps and closed canopy areas within natural and managed beech-dominated forests at four locations in Europe. We used high resolution rDNA techniques to identify ectomycorrhiza-forming fungi and attempted to extract potential stand-, gap-, soil-, and selected environmentally derived variables by applying multivariate analysis and ordination for pooling of ecological groups of ectomycorrhiza. A significant reduction of diversity indices, ectomycorrhizal and fine root dynamics, in gaps in comparison with closed canopy stands indicates an effect of forest management practice and the high importance of maintaining and protecting natural forest areas for conservation of soil biodiversity and forest genetic resources. The ordination analysis revealed three groups of ectomycorrhiza correlated with changing environmental conditions. The litter and soil pH, number of beech seedlings, and presence of a gap had a pronounced effect on the ectomycorrhizal community. Combined analysis of ectomycorrhiza and environmental factors using correspondence analysis provided an insight into the ecological preferences of the analysed species and confirmed that environmental factors drive ectomycorrhizal community changes.

AB  - Soil CO2 efflux is a large component of total respiration in many ecosystems. It is important to understand the environmental controls on soil CO2 efflux, in order to evaluate potential responses of ecosystems to climate change. This study investigated the relationship between total soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature, soil moisture and solar radiation on an interannual basis for a plot of temperate deciduous ancient semi-natural woodland at Wytham Woods in central southern England. We also aimed to quantify the contribution of soil organic matter decomposition (SOM), root-and-rhizosphere respiration, and mycorrhizal respiration components to total soil CO2 efflux, and determine their environmental correlates. Total soil CO2 efflux was measured regularly from April 2006 to December 2008 and found to average 4.1 MgC ha(-)1 yr(-1) in both 2007 and 2008. In addition, we applied a recently developed approach to partition the efflux into SOM, root-and-rhizosphere, and mycorrhizal components in situ using mesh bags. SOM decomposition, root-and-rhizosphere, and mycorrhizal respiration were estimated to contribute 70 +/- 6\%, 22 +/- 6\% and 8 3\% of total soil CO2 efflux respectively. equating to 3.0 +/- 0.3, 0.9 +/- 0.2 and 0.3 +/- 0.1 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). In order to avoid the effect of temporal correlation between variables caused by seasonality, we investigated interannual variability by examining the relationship between CO2 flux anomalies and anomalies in environmental variables. Variation in soil temperature explained 50\% of the interannual variance in soil CO2 efflux, and soil moisture a further 18\% of the residual variance. Solar radiation, as a proxy for plant photosynthesis, had no significant effect on total soil CO2 efflux, but was positively correlated with root-and-rhizosphere respiration, and mycorrhizal respiration. The relationship between anomalies in soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature was highly significant, with a sensitivity of 0.164 +/- 0.023 pmol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)degrees C-1. For mean peak summer efflux rates (2.03 mu mol CO2 m(2) s(-1)), this is equivalent to 8\% per degrees C, or a Q(10) temperature sensitivity of 2.2 +/- 0.2. We demonstrate the utility of an anomaly analysis approach and conclude that soil temperature is the key driver of total soil CO2 efflux primarily through its positive relationship with SOM-decomposition rate.

AB  - Summary: Fungi are the agents primarily responsible for the transformation of plant-derived carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. However, little is known of their responses to the seasonal changes in resource availability in deciduous forests, including photosynthate allocation below ground and seasonal inputs of fresh litter. Vertical stratification of and seasonal changes in fungal abundance, activity and community composition were investigated in the litter, organic and upper mineral soils of a temperate Quercus petraea forest using ergosterol and extracellular enzyme assays and amplicon 454-pyrosequencing of the rDNA-ITS region. Fungal activity, biomass and diversity decreased substantially with soil depth. The highest enzyme activities were detected in winter, especially in litter, where these activities were followed by a peak in fungal biomass during spring. The litter community exhibited more profound seasonal changes than did the community in the deeper horizons. In the litter, saprotrophic genera reached their seasonal maxima in autumn, but summer typically saw the highest abundance of ectomycorrhizal taxa. Although the composition of the litter community changes over the course of the year, the mineral soil shows changes in biomass. The fungal community is affected by season. Litter decomposition and phytosynthate allocation represent important factors contributing to the observed variations. {\textcopyright} 2013 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are very important to plant nutrition, mostly in terms of acquisition of P and micronutrients. While Acacia mangium is closely associated with AMF throughout the whole cycle, Eucalyptus grandis presents this symbiosis primarily at the seedling stage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of AMF in these two tree species in both pure and mixed plantations during the first 20 months after planting. We evaluated the abundance, richness and diversity of AMF spores, the rate of AMF mycorrhizal root colonization, enzymatic activity and soil and litter C, N and P. There was an increase in AMF root colonization of E. grandis when intercropped with A. mangium as well as an increase in the activity of acid and alkaline phosphatase in the presence of leguminous trees. AMF colonization and phosphatase activities were both involved in improvements in P cycling and P nutrition in soil. In addition, P cycling was favored in the intercropped plantation, which showed negative correlation with litter C/N and C/P ratios and positive correlation with soil acid phosphatase activity and soil N and P concentrations. Intercropping A. mangium and E. grandis maximized AMF root colonization of E. grandis and phosphatase activity in the soil, both of which accelerate P cycling and forest performance. {\textcopyright} 2018, Scientia Agricola.

AB  - Leaf litter samples of 12 dicotyledonous tree species (belonging to eight families) growing in a dry tropical forest and in early stages of decomposition were studied for the presence of litter fungi. Equal-sized segments of the leaves incubated in moist chambers were observed every day for 30 d for the presence of fungi. Invariably, the fungal assemblage on the litter of each tree species was dominated by a given fungal species. The diversity of fungi present in the litter varied with the tree species although many species of fungi occurred in the litter of all 12 species. A Pestalotiopsis species dominated the litter fungal assemblage of five trees and was common in the litter of all tree species. The present study and earlier studies from our lab indicate that fungi have evolved traits such as thermotolerant spores, ability to utilize toxic furaldehydes, ability to produce cell wall destructuring enzymes and an endophyte-litter fungus life style to survive and establish themselves in fire-prone forests such as the one studied here. This study shows that in the dry tropical forest, the leaf litter fungal assemblage is governed more by the environment than by the plant species.

AB  - Background and aims: Growth, morphological traits, and mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots show high degree of plasticity in response to changes in nutrient availability, causing shifts in root nutrient-foraging strategy. However, little is known about how this plasticity associated with root branching orders respond to atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in subtropical coniferous forests. Methods: We used soil block sampling method to examine the responses of six key root functional parameters (including three morphological traits (specific root length (SRL), root tissue density (RTD), and root diameter), two growth indices (total root length (TRL) and biomass) on an areal basis across five root orders, and ectomycorrhizal (EM) tip colonization) to different doses and species of N addition in a slash pine (Pinus elliottii) plantation in subtropical China. Results: TRL, root biomass in all root orders, and EM tip colonization increased significantly with N addition. However, SRL, RTD, and root diameter did not change in any root orders. In comparison to low doses of N input, high doses of N input exerted greater effects on lower-order roots. In regard to species of N added, stronger responses in lower-order roots were observed under ammonium-based than nitrated-based N input. Foliar P content was significantly decreased and stoichiometric N:P ratio was markedly increased in response to high dose of ammonium-based N input. Conclusions: Fine root growth and EM tip colonization displayed higher degree of plasticity than morphological traits in response to N addition. The plastic responses were not root-order dependent, but dependent on both N dose and species, especially for ephemeral lower-order roots that are mostly like to be the main nutrient acquisition structures. Our results imply that while N limitation was alleviated by exogenous N input, P limitation may persist or even be exacerbated, thus causing an increase of absorptive root length, biomass, and dependence on ectomycorrhizae for nutrient acquisition in subtropical slash pine plantation forests. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The effects of fire on artificial secondary forests of Pinus massoniana with an average diameter at breast height (DBH) from 5. 5958 cm to 19. 3900 cm, average height from 4. 11 m to 18. 60 m, and average density from 500 clumps hm-2 to 2400 clumps hm-2, were investigated by comparison of burnt and non-burnt plots in a karst mountain area covered by Quaternary clay in central Guizhou province, China. The percentage damage to P. massoniana trees differed among plant organs and followed the order bark (95. 51%) > branches (71. 49%) > crown (62. 95%). The percentage plant death in different forest layers was highest in the herbaceous layer (100%), intermediate in the arbuscular layer (30.43%) and lowest in the arboreous layer (29. 09%). With increasing DBH of P. massoniana in the arboreous layer, the percentage damage to bark was unchanged, whereas damage to branches and the crown decreased, and the percentage death of plants also decreased. At P. massoniana DBH<5 cm, the percentage damage to bark, branches and the crown, percentage plant death and direct loss of biomass were all 100%, whereas at DBH≥25 cm the percentage damage to bark, branches and the crown were 85. 00%, 25. 00% and 15. 00%, respectively, and percentage plant death and direct loss of biomass were zero. In the arbuscular layer, either all individuals of a plant species died, such as P. massoniana, Betula alnoides and Camellia oleifera, all plants survived, such as Prunus serrulata, Myrsine africana and Rhamnus leptophylla, or only some plants died, such as Cunninghamia lanceolata, Castanea seguinii and Aralia chinensis. Plant species in theherbaceous layer either died or germinated after death of aboveground branches and leaves because of fire. In burnt forest, the potential biomass loss (68. 7755 t/ hm2) was higher than direct biomass loss (12. 1818 t/ hm2; percentage direct loss 22.41%). Direct biomass loss differed among the layers and followed the order arboreous layer (6. 9382 t/ hm2) > litter layer (3.3441 t/ hm2) > arbuscular layer (2. 4964 t/ hm2) > herbaceous layer (0. 8861 t/ hm2); in terms of the corresponding percentage direct biomass loss, the order was herbaceous layer (or litter layer, 100. 00%) > arbuscular layer (33. 36%) > arboreous layer (23. 59%). Decreases in the Patrick, Gleason, Simpson and Hurlbert indices followed the order herbaceous layer > arbuscular layer > arboreous layer, and reflected potential losses were higher than direct losses of plant diversity in the different layers of burnt forests. The range and average values of direct diversity loss in the arboreous layer indicated by the Patrick, Gleason, Simpson and Hurlbert indices were 0-1 and 0. 1429, 0-0. 1669 and 0. 0238, 0-1.0000 and 0. 1586, and -0. 1098-0 and -0. 0166, respectively; the corresponding range and average values of percentage direct biodiversity loss were 0-100 and 14. 29, 0-100 and 14. 29, 0. 66-100 and 17. 85, and -18. 61--3. 98 and -11. 29, respectively. The range and average values of direct loss of diversity in the arbuscular layer as measured by these indices were 0-5 and 1. 8571, 0-0. 6948 and 0. 4301, 0-0. 2987 and 0. 1115, and -0. 3477-0 and -0. 1241, respectively; the corresponding range and average values of percentage direct biodiversity loss were 0-42. 86 and 26. 76, 0-42. 85 and 26. 76, 0-86. 35 and 37. 63, and -52. 00-0 and -18. 53, respectively. The range and average values of direct diversity loss in the herbaceous layer indicated by these indices were 2-6 and 3. 8000, 1. 8205-5. 4614 and 3.4589, 0. 2593-0. 8313 and 0. 5300, and 0. 1728-0. 7619 and -0. 4863; the percentage direct loss was 100. 00% for all of the indices. The average burn height of the arboreous layer was negatively correlated to DBH, positively correlated to density and percentage damage to branches, the crown and entire plants, and uncorrelated with percentage damage to bark. The arboreous layer showed higher burn heights than those of the arbuscular layer, and their correlation was negative, and was negatively correlated to potential or direct loss of biomass and positively correlated to percentage direct loss of biomass. Burn height was positively correlated to direct loss or percentage direct loss of biomass, and negatively correlated to potential loss of biomass in the arbuscular layer. Direct loss or percentage direct loss of biomass with the Patrick and Gleason indices was not obviously correlated to burn height in the arboreous layer and was positively correlated to burn height in the arbuscular layer. Burn height was positively correlated to direct loss, and negatively correlated to percentage direct loss, of biomass with the Simpson index in the arboreous layer, and positively correlated to direct loss and percentage direct loss of biomass with the Simpson index in the arbuscular layer. No obvious correlation between burn height of the arboreous or arbuscular layer and direct loss or percentage direct loss of biomass with the Hurlbert index was detected.

AB  - It is increasingly recognized that microbiota affect host health and physiology. However, it is unclear what factors shape microbiome community assembly in nature, and how microbiome assembly can be manipulated to improve host health. All plant leaves host foliar endophytic fungi, which make up a diverse, environmentally acquired fungal microbiota. Here, we experimentally manipulated assembly of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao) fungal microbiome in nature and tested the effect of assembly outcome on host health. Using next-generation sequencing, as well as culture-based methods coupled with Sanger sequencing, we found that manipulating leaf litter exposure and location within the forest canopy significantly altered microbiome composition in cacao. Exposing cacao seedlings to leaf litter from healthy conspecific adults enriched the seedling microbiome with Colletotrichum tropicale, a fungal endophyte known to enhance pathogen resistance of cacao seedlings by upregulating host defensive pathways. As a result, seedlings exposed to healthy conspecific litter experienced reduced pathogen damage. Our results link processes that affect the assembly and composition of microbiome communities to their functional consequences for host success, and have broad implications for understanding plant–microbe interactions. Deliberate manipulation of the plant–fungal microbiome also has potentially important applications for cacao production and other agricultural systems in general. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - A particular group of saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi produced reproductive structures successively on the forest floor after treatment with some nitrogenous compounds (N compounds) such as urea and aqua ammonia. These fungi were also observed after the decomposition of dead bodies or faeces of animals. Their growth in pure culture was examined in liquid media containing ten different N sources (four inorganic and six organic). The saprotrophic Amblyosporium botrytis, Tephrocybe tesquorum, Coprinus echinosporus and C. phlyctidosporus grew well on ammonium, some amino acids (asparagine, glycine), urea and bovine serum albumin, although A. botrytis did not grow on bovine serum albumin. Coprinus phlyctidosporus grew on nitrate as well as on the above N compounds. Peziza urinophila and Pseudombrophila deerata did not grow on any of the N compounds examined. The ectomycorrhizal Laccaria bicolor, Hebeloma vinosophyllum and Hebeloma sp. showed different patterns of nitrogen utilization: L. bicolor grew well on ammonium, nitrate and urea; Hebeloma spp. grew well on ammonium, nitrate, amino acids, urea and bovine serum albumin. None of the fungi tested grew on ethylenediamine or putrescine. The patterns of growth in relation to the nature of nitrogen supply were discussed in relation to the conditions of soil where these fungi occur.

AB  - Trophic interactions between heterotrophic soil microbes and grazing soil invertebrates influence decomposer community composition and function. Cord-forming basidiomycete fungi are primary agents of woody litter decomposition in temperate forests. In laboratory experiments, grazing by woodlice (Isopoda) is an important factor limiting the biomass and functioning (decomposition and extracellular enzyme production) of cord-forming fungi, but its significance in the field has hitherto not been studied. Field populations of the woodlouse, Oniscus asellus, were manipulated ('reduced' {[}zero] or standardised at `current' {[}28 m(-2)] or `double' {[}56 m(-2)] density) in delimited plots inoculated with different fungi (un-inoculated, Hypholoma fasciculare or Phanerochaete velutina) and the effects on the microbial decomposer community assessed after 6 and 12 months. Oniscus asellus population density was reduced after 12 months in comparison to the standardised numbers at start. Significant differences between population densities remained, but varied between fungal inoculation treatments. Fatty acid analysis revealed O. asellus as a true generalist; markers for plants, fungi and bacteria were consistently abundant in storage lipids. Seasonal effects on microbial biomass and function were strong. Although woodlouse population density neither affected fungal biomass nor microbial community composition (ergosterol and soil phospholipid fatty acids), it influenced enzyme activities, depending on the inoculated fungus. Woodlice significantly reduced leucine aminopeptidase and lignin-degrading peroxidase activities, only in un-inoculated plots. In contrast, the highest woodlouse population density increased beech (Fagus sylvatica) wood decomposition and leucine aminopeptidase activity in P. velutina-inoculated plots. Increased enzyme activity and decomposition is likely a stress response, reflecting increased production of specific enzymes to provide the energy for mycelial repair and growth responses to grazing. Effects of grazing on fungal biomass and activity will be strongest at microsites of woodlouse aggregation and where forest floor woodlouse population densities are high. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The functional groups of plants that characterize different phases of succession are expected to show differences in root distribution, fine-root traits and degrees of association with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The relationship involving fine-root traits and AM fungi that regulate the nutrient acquisition potential among different plant functional groups are still not well understood. We assessed fine-root morphology, AM fungal variables and soil fertility in grassland, secondary forest and mature forest in Atlantic, Araucaria and Pantanal ecosystems in Brazil. Soil cores were collected at 0-10 and 10-20cm depths. Fine roots were extracted from soil by sieving and root morphological traits and AM colonization were determined. The AM spores were extracted from soil and counted. In all ecosystems, soil fertility, fine-root mass and root diameter increased with the succession, while root length, specific root length, root-hair length, root-hair incidence, AM colonization and AM spore density decreased. These results suggest that plant species from early stages of tropical succession with inherent rapid growth invest in fine roots and maintain a high degree of AM colonization in order to increase the capacity for nutrient acquisition. Conversely, fine root morphological characteristics and low degree of AM colonization exhibited by plants of the later stages of succession lead toward a low nutrient uptake capacity that combine with their typical low growth rates. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - Microbial necromass is now recognized as an important input into stable soil organic matter pools in terrestrial ecosystems. While melanin and nitrogen content have been identified as factors that influence the decomposition rate of fungal necromass, the effects of mycelial morphology on necromass decomposition remain largely unknown. Using the fungus Armillaria mellea, which produces both diffuse and rhizomorphic biomass in pure culture, we assessed the effects of necromass morphology on decomposition in a 12 week field experiment in Pinus and Quercus dominated forests in Minnesota, USA. Diffuse and rhizomorphic necromass was incubated for 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks to assess differences in decay rates and changes in residual necromass chemistry. Rhizomorphic necromass decomposed significantly slower than diffuse necromass in both forest types. This difference was correlated with initial necromass chemistry, particularly nitrogen content, but not with hydrophobicity. Over the course of the incubation, there was a greater change in the chemistry of diffuse versus rhizomorphic necromass, with both becoming more enriched in recalcitrant compounds. Given that many fungi with both saprotrophic and mycorrhizal ecologies produce rhizomorphs, these results suggest that mycelial morphology should be explicitly considered as an important functional trait influencing the rate of fungal necromass decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microbial communities and their associated enzyme activities play key roles in carbon cycling in ecosystems. Forest thinning is likely to change the soil properties and feedbacks on the structure and function of microbial communities, consequently affecting microbial regulation on the soil carbon process. However, few studies have focused on the mechanism of how thinning affects the quantity and stability of soil carbon. To reveal the influence of thinning on soil carbon and to explore the regulated key factors, this study was conducted in a pure Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr plantation with different thinning intensity (light, medium, and high) in Shanxi province, China. Soil properties (soil pH, soil water content, soil organic carbon, and soil microbial biomass carbon) were measured. Meanwhile, soil microbial communities were examined with the method of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), and soil enzyme activities were measured as indicators of soil microbial functions. The results showed that medium and high thinning has positive effects on soil organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, soil microbial abundance, and soil enzyme activities. Actinomycetes and gram-negative bacteria were the major factors to affect soil microbial community function relating to carbon decomposition. Soil pH contributed to actinomycetes and gram-negative bacteria through direct influences on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Moreover, there were strong correlations between soil pH and microbial community to control soil carbon turnover. The increasing of soil microbial abundance and the microbial regulation on soil carbon in forest thinning need to be considered for sustainable forest management practices in northern China. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Fungi play crucial roles in the biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems, most notably as saprophytes decomposing organic matter and as mycorrhizal fungi enhancing plant nutrient uptake. However, a recurrent problem in fungal ecology is to establish the trophic status of species in the field. Our interpretations and conclusions are too often based on extrapolations from laboratory microcosm experiments or on anecdotal field evidence. Here, we used natural variations in stable carbon isotope ratios ($\delta$13C) as an approach to distinguish between fungal decomposers and symbiotic mycorrhizal fungal species in the rich sporocarp flora (our sample contains 135 species) of temperate forests. We also demonstrated that host-specific mycorrhizal fungi that receive C from overstorey or understorey tree species differ in their $\delta$13C. The many promiscuous mycorrhizal fungi, associated with and connecting several tree hosts, were calculated to receive 57-100% of their C from overstorey trees. Thus, overstorey trees also support, partly or wholly, the nutrient-absorbing mycelia of their alleged competitors, the understorey trees.

AB  - This study was conducted to compare the effects on the growth of Eucalyptus regnans seedlings of unheated soil and soil heated to different extents (as indicated by soil colour-bright red or black) in burnt logging coupes, and to separate the effects of heating of the soil on direct nutrient availability and on morphotypes and effectiveness of ectomycorrhizae. Burnt soils were collected from three logging coupes burnt 2, 14 and 25 months previously and unburnt soil from adjacent regrowth forests. Compared to unburnt soil, the early seedling growth was stimulated in black burnt soil from all coupes (burnt 2, 14 and 25 months previously). Seedling growth was generally poor in red burnt soil, especially in soil collected 2 months after burning. However, the concentration of extractable P was extremely high in red burnt soil, especially in soil collected 2 months after burning. In black burnt soil, extractable P was increased in soil 2 months after burning, but not in the soils collected 14 or 25 months after burning. However, both total P content and concentration in seedlings were increased in all collections of black burnt soil. Frequency of ectomycorrhizae was high in seedlings grown in all black burnt soils, but the mycorrhizal mantles were poorly developed in seedlings in black burnt soil collected 2 months after burning. Seedlings were also ectomycorrhizal in red burnt soil, except in soil collected 2 months after burning. Fine root inocula from seedlings grown in black burnt soils collected 14 and 25 months after burning significantly stimulated both seedling growth and P uptake compared with the uninoculated control, whereas the fine root inocula from the seedlings grown in all the other soils did not. These results suggest that, in black burnt soil, both direct nutritional changes and changes in the ectomycorrhizae may contribute to seedling growth promotion after regeneration burns. The generally poor seedling growth in red burnt soils is likely to have been due to N deficiency as the seedlings in these soils were yellow-green and the tissue concentrations of N were significantly lower than in other treatments.

AB  - Despite the central role of saprotrophic fungi in wood decomposition and terrestrial carbon cycling, the diversity and functioning of wood endophytes (i.e. fungi that asymptomatically colonize living plant tissue) on decay remains poorly understood. In a 4-year field experiment in a boreal forest in the upper midwestern United States, we investigated whether endophytes influenced fungal community structure and subsequent wood decomposition via priority effects. We compared decay of sterilized and non-sterilized birch (Betula papyrifera) logs using both high-throughput sequencing and wood physiochemical analyses (i.e. density loss, dilute alkali solubility, ratio of lignin loss relative to density loss). Endophyte presence significantly altered initial fungal species composition during the first 2 years and enhanced mass loss over the experiment's duration. Results suggest that following tree death the immediate utilization of organic substrates by wood endophytes significantly alters establishment patterns of later arriving fungal saprotrophs. Independent of endophyte presence, white rot was the wood decay outcome at all sampling times, despite an initial presence of both brown and white rot fungi. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that wood endophytes can affect early community assembly and subsequent decay rates, although environmental filtering leads to consistent selection for fungi with lignin-targeted decay strategies.

AB  - The present-day Rhine alluvial hardwood forest (Querco-Ulmetum minoris, Issler 24) in the upper Rhine valley (France/Germany) is comprised of three vegetation units, one still flooded by calm waters (F) and the two others unflooded, one for 30 years (UF30) (after the river canalisation) and the other for about 130 years (UF130) (after river straightening and embankment work in the middle nineteenth century). In the three stands, species composition, structure and diversity of vegetation and nutrient content of mature leaf, leaf litter and soil have been studied. Fungi (Macromycetae) were only studied in two stands (F and UF130). The intensity of nutrient recycling was exemplified by comparing the chemical composition of rainwater, flood, throughfall, mature leaf, leaf litter, soil and groundwater in two of these stands (F and UF30). The elimination of floods has caused a change in floristic composition, tree density and plant diversity. Tree density was higher in the two unflooded stands and was related to a large increase in sapling (< 6 cm dbh) density more than to a change of stem (> 6 cm dbh) density. Sapling density increased 2 times and three limes in the UF30 and the UF130 respectively, whereas the stem density increased only 12\% in the first stand and decreased 29\% in the second one. The saprophytic macromycete communities have been supplemented with mycorrhizal species. Leaf litter production was slightly greater in the flooded (4.44 T ha(-1) yr(-1)) than in the two unflooded stands (less than or equal to 3.72 T ha(-1) yr(-1)). Foliar N level is twice as high in the flooded stands in spite of an opposite soil status. P level decreased in soil and leaves with the duration of isolation and was at the same level in the groundwater in two stands (F and UF30). K, Mg and Ca contents of green leaf and leaf litter were high due to the geochemistry of the Rhine substrate (calcareous gravels and pebbles) and similar in all the stands studied, even though there are large inputs of these three elements by floods. Moreover we showed that the groundwater chemistry reflected the variations of nutrient inputs and thus could be a good indicator of the functioning of an alluvial ecosystem and of its change as a result of human activities. The restoration of floods in hardwood forest contributes to the preservation of alluvial vegetational structure and composition, the stimulation of biological processes and a better plant mineral nutrition and water supply.

AB  - We assessed the degree to which ectomycorrhizal fungi exploit organic nitrogen in situ. In an Alaskan boreal forest, we identified pairs of sporocarps from five taxa of ectomycorrhizal fungi. We added (13)C-labeled alanine to the soil surrounding one sporocarp within each pair; the second served as an unlabeled control. Peak rates of (13)C-respiration from alanine were higher in the labeled sporocarp plots than the controls, indicating that the (13)C-alanine was detectably respired from the soil. ``Reference{''} plots adjacent to the sporocarps served as an indication of background (13)C-respiration rates released by the soil community as a whole. Ectomycorrhizal sporocarps displayed higher (13)C-respiration rates than their reference plots. Thus, the sporocarps and associated mycorrhizal mycelium appeared to contribute significantly to the release of alanine-derived (13)CO(2), confirming the hypothesis that ectomycorrhizal fungi may access soil amino acid pools under natural conditions.

AB  - A study of mushrooms associated with oil palm agroforests in Edo State, South-South of Nigeria was undertaken. A total of 49 fruit bodies-belonging to 26 different species of mushrooms in the divisions Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, class Gasteromycetes, Discomycetes, Hymenomycetes were recorded from the study. The order Agaricales, family Tricholomataceae and genus Marasmius were the most abundant and commonly represented taxa. Palm Fronds (PF) supported the highest number of mushroom taxa (19%) followed by Fallen Palm Tree (FPT), Fruit Bunch (FB) and Decomposing Palm Litters (DPL) each of which supported 14% of the total species of mushrooms recorded during the study. Mushrooms irrespective of their functional role as natural decomposers were recognised by the study as pivotal to sustainable local agroforest management practices in Nigeria. Oil palm plantations surveyed during the study competes favourably with forests as sources of indigenous utility mushrooms. {\textcopyright} 2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - Plant communities on nutrient-poor soils are thought to use nutrients more efficiently to produce biomass than plant communities on nutrient-rich soils. Yet, increased efficiency with declining soil nutrients has not been demonstrated empirically in lowland tropical rain forests, where plant growth is thought to be strongly limited by soil nutrients, especially phosphorus (P). We tested for higher P uptake and use efficiency across a 16-fold soil P gradient in lowland Borneo by measuring the P content of aboveground net primary productivity (fine litter production plus new tree growth; ANPP) for 24 months. Extractable soil P was positively related to litter production, tree growth, and ANPP. Efficiency of P response (ANPP/available soil P), uptake (P uptake/available soil P), and use (ANPP/P uptake) increased monotonically with declining soil P and was significantly higher on P-rich soil than P-poor soil. Increased P uptake and use efficiency with declining soil P enabled higher than expected plant productivity on low P soils and thus strongly influenced spatial patterns of aboveground productivity throughout this lowland landscape. A complementary P use efficiency index, the integrated canopy P (Pc) use efficiency of production (ANPP/Pc x residence time of P c), was similar across the P gradient, but underlying dynamics varied significantly with soil P: on rich soils, ANPP/Pc was high and Pc residence time was low, while the converse held on poor soils. These contrasting strategies enabled rapid tree growth on nutrient-rich soils, where P limitation is relatively weak, and higher P conservation on nutrient-poor soils, where P limitation is relatively strong. The occurrence of contrasting P use strategies on high and low P soils has important implications for understanding spatial patterns of aboveground productivity, P cycling, and canopy tree species composition across the P gradient. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Photosynthesis by leaves and acquisition of water and minerals by roots are required for plant growth, which is a key component of many ecosystem functions. Although the role of leaf functional traits in photosynthesis is generally well understood, the relationship of root functional traits to nutrient uptake is not. In particular, predictions of nutrient acquisition strategies from specific root traits are often vague. Roots of nearly all plants cooperate with mycorrhizal fungi in nutrient acquisition. Most tree species form symbioses with either arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. Nutrients are distributed heterogeneously in the soil, and nutrient-rich "hotspots" can be a key source for plants. Thus, predicting the foraging strategies that enable mycorrhizal root systems to exploit these hotspots can be critical to the understanding of plant nutrition and ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. Here, we show that in 13 sympatric temperate tree species, when nutrient availability is patchy, thinner root species alter their foraging to exploit patches, whereas thicker root species do not. Moreover, there appear to be two distinct pathways by which thinner root tree species enhance foraging in nutrient-rich patches: AM trees produce more roots, whereas EM trees produce more mycorrhizal fungal hyphae. Our results indicate that strategies of nutrient foraging are complementary among tree species with contrasting mycorrhiza types and root morphologies, and that predictable relationships between below-ground traits and nutrient acquisition emerge only when both roots and mycorrhizal fungi are considered together.

AB  - Characterizing the chemical changes in fungal necromass as it degrades, particularly over short time intervals (days to weeks), is critical to clearly understanding how this organic matter source contributes to various belowground carbon and nutrient pools. Using a range of chemical analyses, we assessed the degradation of four types of ectomycorrhizal fungal necromass from three species differing in biochemical composition. Samples were buried in a forest in Minnesota, USA and harvested at eight time points over a 90-day incubation period (1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 60, 90 days). Three of the necromass types lost greater than 50\% of their initial mass in the first seven days, but mass loss plateaued for all four types at later harvests, and after 90 days, none of the samples were completely degraded. Relative to undegraded necromass, degraded necromass consistently contained a lower relative abundance of aliphatic compounds and a higher relative abundance of carbohydrates, sterols, and aromatic compounds. For three of the four necromass types, nitrogen content was lower after 90 days of degradation and FTIR spectra revealed distinct peaks broadening from day 0 to day 90. While melanin content significantly slowed degradation within species, differences in degradation rates across species were more closely aligned with initial nitrogen content. Collectively, our results indicate that the rapid mass loss of dead fungal mycelium is accompanied by a wide range of changes in necromass chemistry, likely contributing to both short-term soil nutrient and longer-term carbon pools.

AB  - Seedlings near a conspecific adult might suffer increased mortality due to pressure from enemies such as below-ground pathogenic fungi (Janzen–Connell hypothesis), however, variation exists among taxa such that some experience low levels of mortality. We hypothesized that seedlings close to adults might profit, rather than suffer, from below-ground fungi, notably from mycorrhiza or decomposers, in particular near large adult trees and under a closely related canopy. We planted oak seedlings in a temperate forest at different distances from adults and followed seedling mortality, budburst (early budburst permitting photosynthesis during the best light conditions) and leaf herbivory. We applied fungicide on half of the seedlings for 2 years to identify the net effect of below-ground fungi on seedlings. We quantified seedling mycorrhization and fungal-driven decomposition of a neighbourhood-specific and an unspecific substrate, local oak leaves and cellulose respectively. Finally, we related mycorrhization and decomposition to seedling performance. We found that, in seedlings planted close to conspecific adults, below-ground fungi had a negative net effect on seedlings: elimination of fungi, surprisingly, decreased herbivory. This effect could be due to oak leaf decomposition, which was related to increased seedling herbivory and was higher near a conspecific adult. Under a closely related canopy, however, the net effect of below-ground fungi on nearby seedlings became positive: elimination of fungi delayed budburst. This effect could be due to colonization by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Cortinarius sp., which related to accelerated budburst and was higher near a conspecific under a closely related canopy. Effects of below-ground fungi on nearby seedlings were not dependent on the size of the conspecific and were species but not lineage specific. Overall, our results suggest that a Janzen–Connell-like pattern, that is, increased mortality of seedlings near conspecific adult, can be (1) induced by specialist decomposers increasing the nutritional quality of conspecific seedlings to herbivores, and (2) offset by ectomycorrhizal fungal mutualists under a closely related canopy. Coexistence among closely related adult trees appears to change interactions between adults and nearby conspecific seedlings from conspecific inhibition to conspecific facilitation.

AB  - In deciduous oaks, spring reactivation modifies the capability of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMf to mobilise carbon from soil organic matter. Plant carbon budget is also unbalanced during spring reactivation: carbon demand is high to build new tissues and carbon may be provided by reserves only as new photoassimilates are not yet available. Using a stable isotope approach with C-13-labelled litter, we have estimated that after a six months experiment, less than 1\% of carbon is derived from litter during spring reactivation and is channelled from the soil to the thick roots of Quercus petraea via ectomycorrhiza, even when leaves are photosynthetically active. Our results are promising for future detailed quantification of different carbon sources (i.e. reserves, photosynthesis and litter derived) in EMf oak trees. They also support the hypothesis that oak trees of Q petraea in north-eastern France are partially mixotrophic plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Like other N-fixing invasive species in Hawaii, Falcataria moluccana dramatically alters forest structure, litterfall quality and quantity, and nutrient dynamics. We hypothesized that these biogeochernical changes would also affect the soil microbial community and the extracellular enzymes responsible for carbon and nutrient mineralization. Across three sites differing in substrate texture and age (50-300 years old), we measured soil enzyme activities and microbial community parameters in native-dominated and Falcataria-invaded plots. Falcataria invasion increased acid phosphatase (AP) activities to > 90 mu mol g(-1) soil h(-1) compared to 30-60 mu mol g(-1) soil h(-1) in nativedominated stands. Extracellular enzymes that mineralize carbon and nitrogen also increased significantly under Falcataria on the younger substrates. By contrast, total microbial biomass and mycorrhizal abundance changed little with invasion or substrate. However, fungal: bacterial ratios declined dramatically with invasion, from 2.69 and 1.35 to < 0.89 on the 50- and 200-year-old substrates, respectively. These results suggest that Falcataria invasion alters the composition and function of belowground soil communities in addition to forest structure and biogeochemistry. The increased activities of AP and other enzymes that we observed are consistent with a shift toward phosphorus limitation and rapid microbial processing of litterfall C and N following Falcataria invasion.

AB  - Many field and laboratory studies have demonstrated that the addition of easily available carbon can increase rates of decomposition of plant litter or humified soil organic matter, though opposite trends are also common. In boreal forests, a large part of labile carbon enters soil via tree roots and ectomycorrhizal (EM) network. The influence of increased C availability and the presence of EM roots on litter decomposition was studied in a long-term field experiment in a 50-year-old Picea abies plantation. Litterbags containing litter of three species (Populus tremula, Quercus robur, or P. abies) were buried to the depth of ca. 2.5 cm. The experiment was set up in a full-factorial design with carbon availability and presence of roots as factors. Carbon was added as an aqueous sucrose solution (50 g C m-2) every second week during snow-free period. Spruce roots around and underneath experimental plots were cut once a month. Subsets of litterbags were analysed after 12, 21 and 24 months. The serial dilution technique was used to assess the fungal community composition. The addition of labile carbon led to a strong decrease in litter decomposition rates, associated with consistent shifts in the composition of saprotrophic microfungal communities, and to an increase in the overall density of culturable fungal species (r-strategists), but not of specialized cellulolytic microfungi (K-strategists), isolated on Hutchinson agar. Sucrose addition did not affect the number of species isolated but the dominance structure was shifted toward the domination of the 2-4 most abundant species. The presence of EM roots significantly reduced moisture content in decomposing litter but had only weak and inconsistent effect on the decomposition rates and on the community composition of saprotrophic microfungi; these effects did not depend on the level of carbon availability. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of long-term reforestation on soil microbial communities and biomass are poorly understood. This study was conducted on two coniferous plantations: Cunninghamia konishii Hayata, planted 40 years ago (CONIF-40), and Calocedrus formosana (Florin) Florin, planted 80 years ago (CONIF-80). An adjacent natural broadleaf forest (BROAD-Nat) was used as a control. We determined microbial biomass C and N contents, enzyme activities, and community composition (via phospholipid fatty acid [PLFA] assessment). Both microbial biomass and PLFA content were higher in the summer than in the winter and differed among the forests in summer only. Total PLFA, total bacterial, gram-positive bacterial, gram-negative bacterial, and vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal contents followed the same pattern. Total fungal content and the ratios of fungi to bacteria and of gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria were highest in CONIF-40, with no difference between the other forests. Principal component analysis of PLFA contents revealed that CONIF-40 communities were distinct from those of CONIF-80 and BROAD-Nat. Our results suggest that vegetation replacement during reforestation exerts a prolonged impact on the soil microbial community. The understory broadleaf shrubs and trees established after coniferous plantation reforestation may balance out the effects of coniferous litter, contributing to bacterial recovery. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the authors.

AB  - Invasive trees can alter soil properties and ecosystem functioning by producing phenolic compounds. Phenolics can influence carbon and nitrogen availability as well as enzymatic activity or act as signaling molecules. In plant-microorganism interactions, species-specific phenolics can be the source of food or toxicity. They may have antimicrobial, stimulatory or both (ambiguous) properties and thus affect soil microbial properties, enzymatic activity, and plant-soil feedbacks differently. We hypothesized that phenolic compounds with antimicrobial properties produced by invasive Quercus rubra would reduce soil microbial biomass and enzymatic activity, and alter microbial community structure. We expected these changes to be most pronounced in the soil organic horizon as they are driven by litter chemistry. We tested changes, potentially associated with the concentrations of 12 phenolic compounds in Q. rubra litter and soil, in microbial properties (respiration rate, bacterial and fungal biomass), enzymatic activity, and microbial community structure in organic and mineral soil horizons as well as in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spore number and species richness in mineral soil horizon. We found that Q. rubra reduced several soil parameters, namely respiration rate, phosphatase activity, total microbial biomass, bacterial (both G + and G–) biomass, and 16:1$\omega$5 NLFA AMF storage lipid marker as well as changed microbial community structure, which supports our hypothesis that the phenolics produced by Q. rubra have mostly toxic effect on native soil communities. However, Q. rubra did not affect arylsulfatase and urease activity, saprotrophic fungi population, and the number of AMF spores and species. The changes in soil microbial properties and enzymatic activity may be related to high amounts of ellagic acid, ferulic acid, phloridzin, and syringic acid provided with newly shed Q. rubra litter to the soil surface. Some phenolics found in soil, i.e., phloridzin and (–)-epicatechin, correlated negatively, while others, i.e., quercetin and chlorogenic acid, correlated positively with soil microbial parameters and/or enzymatic activity, which suggest either antimicrobial or stimulatory properties of these compounds. Our study demonstrated that invasive Q. rubra has multiple potential effects on soil microbial communities, which can mediate plant-soil feedbacks. Future research should address the long-term consequences of these changes for forest ecosystems and the fitness of native flora. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Epiphytic orchids, which account for 68% of vascular epiphytes, contribute substantially to plant species diversity in forest canopies. Many orchid species are naturally rare and have limited geographical distributions. All orchids rely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient acquisition during seed germination and seedling establishment, and many species retain these associations throughout their lifecycle. Due to their reliance on mycorrhizal fungi, epiphytic orchid species with highly specific mycorrhizal associations may be geographically restricted and are often rare. Dendrobium okinawense is a rare epiphytic orchid endemic to the Yambaru Forest in Japan and to southern Taiwan. We hypothesized that this species exhibits high mycorrhizal specificity and tested this hypothesis via identification of the species' mycorrhizal associates. We collected root samples of this orchid from four tree species and assessed mycorrhizal fungi in 25 root fragments harvested from 10 plants. Fungi were identified using molecular methods based on fungal isolates and DNA extracted from mycorrhizal roots. Detected fungi were assigned to 21 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% sequence similarity of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region sequences. TU11, an OTU belonging to Tulasnellaceae (Basidiomycota), was the most frequently detected OTU, occurring in 20 root fragments from all 10 sampled individuals. Our results indicate that Dendrobium okinawense has a highly specific association with TU11. Further, this specificity may be high relative to the Dendrobium species assessed in other studies. These findings support the hypothesis that Dendrobium okinawense exhibits high mycorrhizal specificity. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Japanese Forest Society.

AB  - The impact of atmospheric nitrogen deposition on forest ecosystems depends in large part on its fate. Past tracer studies show that litter and soils dominate the short-term fate of added 15N, yet few have examined its longer term dynamics or differences among forest types. This study examined the fate of a 15N-NO- 3 tracer over 5–6 years in a mixed deciduous stand that was evenly composed of trees with ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. The tracer was expected to slowly mineralize from its main initial fate in litter and surface soil, with some 15N moving to trees, some to deeper soil, and some net losses. Recovery of added 15N in trees and litterfall totaled 11.3% both 1 and 5–6 years after the tracer addition, as 15N redistributed from fine and especially coarse roots into cumulative litterfall and small accumulations in woody tissues. Estimates of potential carbon sequestration from tree 15N recovery amounted to 12–14 kg C per kg of N deposition. Tree 15N acquisition occurred within the first year after the tracer addition, with no subsequent additional net transfer of 15N from detrital to plant pools. In both years, ectomycorrhizal trees gained 50% more of the tracer than did trees with arbuscular mycorrhizae. Much of the 15N recovered in wood occurred in tree rings formed prior to the 15N addition, demonstrating the mobility of N in wood. Tracer recovery rapidly decreased over time in surface litter material and accumulated in both shallow and deep soil, perhaps through mixing by earthworms. Overall, results showed redistribution of tracer 15N through trees and surface soils without any losses, as whole-ecosystem recovery remained constant between 1 and 5–6 years at 70% of the 15N addition. These results demonstrate the persistent ecosystem retention of N deposition even as it redistributes, without additional plant uptake over this timescale. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Soils of northern temperate and boreal forests represent a large terrestrial carbon (C) sink. The fate of this C under elevated atmospheric CO2 and climate change is still uncertain. A fundamental knowledge gap is the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) and saprotrophic fungi contribute to C cycling in the systems by soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition. In this study, we used a novel approach to generate and compare enzymatically active EMF hyphae-dominated and saprotrophic hyphae-enriched communities under field conditions. Fermentation-humus (FH)-filled mesh bags, surrounded by a sand barrier, effectively trapped EMF hyphae with a community structure comparable to that found in the surrounding FH layer, at both trophic and taxonomic levels. In contrast, over half the sequences from mesh bags with no sand barrier were identified as belonging to saprotrophic fungi. The EMF hyphae-dominated systems exhibited levels of hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme activities that were comparable to or higher than saprotroph-enriched systems. The enzymes assayed included those associated with both labile and recalcitrant SOM degradation. Our study shows that EMF hyphae are likely important contributors to current SOM turnover in sub-boreal systems. Our results also suggest that any increased EMF biomass that might result from higher below-ground C allocation by trees would not suppress C fluxes from sub-boreal soils. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Microbial Ecology.

AB  - We investigated how forest composition, litter quality, and rainfall interact to affect leaf litter decomposition across three successional tropical dry forests in Costa Rica. We monitored litter stocks and bulk litter turnover in 18 plots that exhibit substantial variation in soil characteristics, tree community structure, fungal communities (including forests dominated by ecto- or arbuscular mycorrhizal host trees), and forest age. Simultaneously, we decomposed three standard litter substrates over a 6-month period spanning an unusually intense drought. Decay rates of standard substrates depended on the interaction between litter identity and forest type. Decomposition rates were correlated with tree and soil fungal community composition as well as soil fertility, but these relationships differed among litter types. In low fertility soils dominated by ectomycorrhizal oak trees, bulk litter turnover rates were low, regardless of soil moisture. By contrast, in higher fertility soils that supported mostly arbuscular mycorrhizal trees, bulk litter decay rates were strongly dependent on seasonal water availability. Both measures of decomposition increased with forest age, as did the frequency of termite-mediated wood decay. Taken together, our results demonstrate that soils and forest age exert strong control over decomposition dynamics in these tropical dry forests, either directly through effects on microclimate and nutrients, or indirectly by affecting tree and microbial community composition and traits, such as litter quality. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Whereas the primary controls on litter decomposition are well established, we lack a framework for predicting interspecific differences in litter decay within and across ecosystems. Given previous research linking tree mycorrhizal association with carbon and nutrient dynamics, we hypothesized that the two dominant mycorrhizal groups in forests - arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi - differ in litter decomposition rates. We compiled leaf litter chemistry and decay data for AM- and ECM-associating angiosperms and gymnosperms (> 200 species) from temperate and tropical/subtropical, and investigated relationships among decay rates, mycorrhizal association, phylogeny and climate. In temperate forests, AM litters decayed faster than ECM litters, with litter nitrogen and phylogeny best explaining variation in litter decay. In sub/tropical forests, we found no significant difference in litter decay rate between mycorrhizal groups, and variation in decay rates was best explained by litter phosphorus. Our results suggest that knowledge of tree mycorrhizal association may improve predictions of species effects on ecosystem processes, particularly in temperate forests where AM and ECM species commonly co-occur, providing a predictive framework for linking litter quality, organic matter dynamics and nutrient acquisition in forests.

AB  - The article presents the results of a study of the sanitary-microbiological parameters of soils in cedar stands on the example of the Vologda Oblast of Russia. The taxation description of cedar plantations showed that both urban and Siberian cedar plantings in the urban environment and beyond are distinguished by good growth. In the studied objects, the presence of phytopathogenic fungi dangerous for trees was found in soils, such as Aphanomyces, Fusarium, Phytophthora, Pythium, Verticillium, and the presence of saprotrophic fungi with antagonistic properties, such as Mucorales, Clonostachys, Trichoderma, Mortierella, Mucor. Phytopathogenic activity correlates inversely with the activity of saprotrophs-antagonists found in the zone of coexistence. According to microbiological indicators, the diversity of antagonistic fungi with signs of high suppression indicates the well-being of the studied soil samples. Based on the sanitary-microbiological assessment in the studied cedar groves, recommendations were developed and proposed for protecting soils in the cedar stands, such as selective forest protection measures, clearing of litter, and laboratory tests to determine the toxicity of soils that affect the growth and development of cedar stands. {\textcopyright} 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In the soils of mature forests, nitrogen availability is mainly the result of litter decomposition. Thus protein degradation is of major interest for nutrition, Two aspartic proteases were excreted in a pH-dependent manner by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria grown in liquid culture, AmProt1 with a molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa was mainly present at pH values up to 5.4, whereas the excretion of AmProt2 with a molecular mass of about 90 kDa was only detectable at pH values between pH 5.4 and 6.3. In addition, the pH optima of both enzymes differed significantly. AmProt1 had a narrow pH optimum around 3, whereas AmProt2 had a broad pH optimum between 3 and 5.5 and a higher affinity to the substrate methylcasein. One cDNA-clone (AmProt1{*}) that presumably encodes AmProt1 was identified. Like AmProt1, this cDNA was expressed in a pa-dependent manner. In addition, carbohydrate and to a lesser extent nitrogen depletion significantly enhanced AmProt1{* expression. In fully developed Populus hyb./A. muscaria ectomycorrhizas the expression of AmProt1{*} was significantly higher in hyphae of the Hartig net compared with those of the fungal sheath. The role of AmProt1 and AmProt2 for fungal physiology and competitiveness is discussed.

AB  - The species diversity and distribution of 3 ecological groups of fungi (viz., foliar endophytes, phellophytes, and leaf litter fungi of 6 tree hosts of a dry thorn forest and 6 tree hosts of an evergreen forest of southern India) were studied. As the methods of sampling and the isolation procedure were maintained constant, the results could be compared across hosts and fungal assemblages. The diversity of endophytes was less in both forests, owing to host recurrence. The litter fungi showed a higher diversity in both forests when compared with endophytes or phellophytes. There was little overlap between the species assemblages of the 3 ecological groups of fungi. Hence, to be cost effective, diversity estimation exercises for fungi in the tropics should include different fungal substrates rather than one substrate (or ecological group); it appears that even small sample sizes of different substrates would provide an approximation that is the near-real species diversity, rather than using large sample sizes of any one particular indicator group of fungi.

AB  - Fungi dominate the microbial biomass of temperate forest soils and are a key driver of ecosystem nutrient cycling. Chronic nitrogen (N) amendments frequently cause the accumulation of soil organic matter within soils, suggesting that elevated N disrupts decomposition by altering fungal communities: To link previously observed increases in soil organic matter with potential changes in the fungal community, we assessed the effects of soil N amendment on fungal community structure at a long-term N addition experiment at Harvard Forest (Petersham, MA, USA). A decline in the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi following long-term N addition was offset by an increase in the relative abundance of saprotrophs. Species richness and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi declined, while ascomycetes and saprotrophs responded positively to N enrichment. However, nitrophilic species included ectomycorrhizal as well as saprotrophic fungi, especially the ectomycorrhizal Russula vinacea, whose relative abundance increased from 10 to 37\% of the entire community across N treatments. Two decades of soil N enrichment appears to have fundamentally altered the soil fungal community of this temperate forest. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - In boreal forests, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are found in soil layers containing decomposed litter and humus-rich soil organic matter (SOM). This chapter summarizes the present understanding of the mechanisms for oxidative decomposition of SOM and the hydrolysis and mobilization of organic N and P sources by ECM fungi. It discusses how these processes may influence the formation and stability of SOM, and the interactions with saprotrophic microorganisms in forest ecosystems. The chapter gives a brief introduction to litter decomposition mechanisms in saprotrophic fungi. To investigate experimentally the capacity of ECM fungi to decompose humic-rich SOM and the mechanisms underlying this decomposition, a series of experiments have been conducted using Paxillus involutus as a "model" species. ECM fungi have evolved from diverse nutritional backgrounds, including litter decomposers and WR and BR wood decayers. During these transitions, ECM lineages lost many genes related to saprotrophy. There is evidence that some ECM employ the Fenton reaction during SOM decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to evaluate substrate dependence of the symbiotic fungal associations in leafy liverworts (Jungermanniopsida), 28 species out of 12 families were investigated by transmission electron microscopy and molecular methods. Samples were obtained from the diverse substrates : from naked soil, from the forest floor on needle litter, from between peat moss, from rotten bark of standing trees, and from stumps and rotten wood. Associations with ascomycetes were found in most of the specimens independent from the substrate. Seven species sampled from soil were found to contain basidiomycete hyphae. Ultrastructure consistently showed dolipores with imperforate parenthesomes. Molecular phylogenetic studies revealed that three specimens belonging to the Jungermanniales were associated with members of Sebacinaceae, while Aneura pinguis (Metzgeriales) was associated with a Tulasnella species. These taxa are so far the only basidiomycetes known to be symbiotically associated with leafy liverworts. The probability that the associations with Sebacinaceae are evolutionary old, but the Tulasnella associations more derived is discussed. The sebacinoid mycobionts form a similar interaction type with the jungermannialian leafy liverworts as do the associated ascomycetes. The term 'jungermannioid mycorrhiza' is proposed for this distinctive symbiotic interaction type.

AB  - During the last century important ecological and physiological principles in mycorrhizal associations were discovered. Effects of litter extracts on the microflora, nutrient uptake and translocation; hormonal relations, the M factor, and physiogical requirements of ectomycorrhizal fungi and metabolite exchanges are among those of particular significance. Reconsideration of this era of mycorrhizal research is worthy of current consideration since progress particularly in physiology has been slow. To derive the potentially vast benefits from mycorrhizal associations in field applications and to achieve genetic alteration to improve physiological benefits derived from mycorrhizas, fundamental characteristics and biochemical mechanisms in the fungus-root complex must be better understood. {\textcopyright} 1983 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W.

AB  - Plant nutrients can be recycled through microbial decomposition of organic matter but replacement of base cations and phosphorus, lost through harvesting of biomass/biofuels or leaching, requires de novo supply of fresh nutrients released through weathering of soil parent material (minerals and rocks). Weathering involves physical and chemical processes that are modified by biological activity of plants, microorganisms and animals. This article reviews recent progress made in understanding biological processes contributing to weathering. A perspective of increasing spatial scale is adopted, examining the consequences of biological activity for weathering from nanoscale interactions, through in vitro and in planta microcosm and mesocosm studies, to field experiments, and finally ecosystem and global level effects. The topics discussed include the physical alteration of minerals and mineral surfaces; the composition, amounts, chemical properties, and effects of plant and microbial secretions; and the role of carbon flow (including stabilisation and sequestration of C in organic and inorganic forms). Although the predominant focus is on the effects of fungi in forest ecosystems, the properties of biofilms, including bacterial interactions, are also discussed. The implications of these biological processes for modelling are discussed, and we attempt to identify some key questions and knowledge gaps, as well as experimental approaches and areas of research in which future studies are likely to yield useful results. A particular focus of this article is to improve the representation of the ways in which biological processes complement physical and chemical processes that mobilise mineral elements, making them available for plant uptake. This is necessary to produce better estimates of weathering that are required for sustainable management of forests in a post-fossil-fuel economy. While there are abundant examples of nanometre- and micrometre-scale physical interactions between microorganisms and different minerals, opinion appears to be divided with respect to the quantitative significance of these observations for overall weathering. Numerous in vitro experiments and microcosm studies involving plants and their associated microorganisms suggest that the allocation of plant-derived carbon, mineral dissolution and plant nutrient status are tightly coupled, but there is still disagreement about the extent to which these processes contribute to field-scale observations. Apart from providing dynamically responsive pathways for the allocation of plant-derived carbon to power dissolution of minerals, mycorrhizal mycelia provide conduits for the long-distance<span idCombining double low line"page1508"/> transportation of weathering products back to plants that are also quantitatively significant sinks for released nutrients. These mycelial pathways bridge heterogeneous substrates, reducing the influence of local variation in <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">C:N</span> ratios. The production of polysaccharide matrices by biofilms of interacting bacteria and/or fungi at interfaces with mineral surfaces and roots influences patterns of production of antibiotics and quorum sensing molecules, with concomitant effects on microbial community structure, and the qualitative and quantitative composition of mineral-solubilising compounds and weathering products. Patterns of carbon allocation and nutrient mobilisation from both organic and inorganic substrates have been studied at larger spatial and temporal scales, including both ecosystem and global levels, and there is a generally wider degree of acceptance of the "systemic" effects of microorganisms on patterns of nutrient mobilisation. Theories about the evolutionary development of weathering processes have been advanced but there is still a lack of information connecting processes at different spatial scales. Detailed studies of the liquid chemistry of local weathering sites at the micrometre scale, together with upscaling to soil-scale dissolution rates, are advocated, as well as new approaches involving stable isotopes. {\textcopyright} 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

AB  - Plant roots, their associated microbial community and free-living soil microbes interact to regulate the movement of carbon from the soil to the atmosphere, one of the most important and least understood fluxes of terrestrial carbon. Our inadequate understanding of how plant-microbial interactions alter soil carbon decomposition may lead to poor model predictions of terrestrial carbon feedbacks to the atmosphere. Roots, mycorrhizal fungi and free-living soil microbes can alter soil carbon decomposition through exudation of carbon into soil. Exudates of simple carbon compounds can increase microbial activity because microbes are typically carbon limited. When both roots and mycorrhizal fungi are present in the soil, they may additively increase carbon decomposition. However, when mycorrhizas are isolated from roots, they may limit soil carbon decomposition by competing with free-living decomposers for resources. We manipulated the access of roots and mycorrhizal fungi to soil in situ in a temperate mixed deciduous forest. We added 13C-labelled substrate to trace metabolized carbon in respiration and measured carbon-degrading microbial extracellular enzyme activity and soil carbon pools. We used our data in a mechanistic soil carbon decomposition model to simulate and compare the effects of root and mycorrhizal fungal presence on soil carbon dynamics over longer time periods. Contrary to what we predicted, root and mycorrhizal biomass did not interact to additively increase microbial activity and soil carbon degradation. The metabolism of 13C-labelled starch was highest when root biomass was high and mycorrhizal biomass was low. These results suggest that mycorrhizas may negatively interact with the free-living microbial community to influence soil carbon dynamics, a hypothesis supported by our enzyme results. Our steady-state model simulations suggested that root presence increased mineral-associated and particulate organic carbon pools, while mycorrhizal fungal presence had a greater influence on particulate than mineral-associated organic carbon pools. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the activity of enzymes involved in organic matter decomposition was contingent upon root-mycorrhizal-microbial interactions. Using our experimental data in a decomposition simulation model, we show that root-mycorrhizal-microbial interactions may have longer-term legacy effects on soil carbon sequestration. Overall, our study suggests that roots stimulate microbial activity in the short term, but contribute to soil carbon storage over longer periods of time. {\textcopyright} 2015 British Ecological Society.

AB  - Naturally thermotolerant vegetation in New Zealand is concentrated in approximately 39 geothermally heated areas totalling only 580 ha scattered along the 300 km length of the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Relationships between composition and structure of vegetation and environment were analysed at the comparatively large (95 ha) and unmodified Te Kopia geothermal steamfield. Vascular vegetation was mostly influenced by a strong gradient in soil temperature, ranging at 15 cm depth from 15°C to 90°C across the steamfield. Dominant species changed from evergreen, broadleaved forest at the cool end of this gradient to dominance on increasingly hot soils by myrtaceous and epacrid (southern heath) shrubs with small needle‐like leaves and shallow roots. While differences in cryptogam composition were mostly associated with spatial variation in soil temperature, they were also significantly influenced by soil acidity and Al concentration. All soils sampled along the gradient had low fertility, high acidity, and high levels of Al, SO4, and Fe. This suggests that vegetation considered to be geothermally influenced should include relatively tall forest and scrub further from fumarole centres than has previously been recognised. Plants of geothermal areas tolerate acid soils with levels of Al that normally would be toxic. Mycorrhizal relationships may play important roles in plant survivorship in this environment by assisting nutrient acquisition. In common with the changes in community characteristics typical of other steep gradients of increasing stress, as soil temperatures increase so canopy height, plant stature, species richness, leaf size, and rooting depth decrease. These distinctive ecosystems provide excellent opportunities for research on plant community response to natural stress. {\textcopyright} 1997 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Understanding plant roots induced changes in soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition, the rhizosphere effect, is critical to predict soil carbon and nutrient cycling within and across biomes. Root functional traits are proposed to regulate the rhizosphere effect. We measured the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition by incubating rhizosphere and bulk soils sampled from 14 hardwood species with distinct mycorrhizal associations (Arbuscular mycorrhizal, AM vs. Ectomycorrhizal, ECM). We also measured root traits (related to chemistry, morphology and physiology), soil enzymes related to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous cycling and soil physico-chemical properties, which could explain the mechanisms that regulate interspecific variation of the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition. There was large interspecific variation in the rhizosphere effects on SOM decomposition and soil enzymes, which was not influenced by mycorrhizal associations. Root traits were more strongly correlated with the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition across the 14 hardwood species than bulk soil physico-chemical properties. Specifically, the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition was correlated positively with root nitrogen concentration, and negatively with root carbon/nitrogen ratio and root diameter, respectively. These three root traits were the most important predictors for the interspecific variation of the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition amongst all measured variables. Moreover, the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition tended to increase with increasing root exudationn rates. This is compelling evidence that the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition tends to increase along the root economics spectrum from conservative species to acquisitive species in woody plants. Our findings thus contribute to a better mechanistic link between root traits and rhizosphere effect across species, which could be incorporated into land surface models to predict ecosystem scale consequences of root induced changes in SOM decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Predicting the response of fine roots to increased atmospheric CO2 concentration has important implications for carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Root architecture is known to play an important role in how trees acquire soil resources in changing environments. However, the effects of elevated CO2 on the fine-root architecture of trees remain unclear. We investigated the architectural response of fine roots exposed to 14 yr of CO2 enrichment and 6 yr of nitrogen (N) fertilization in a Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) forest. Root traits reflecting geometry, topology and uptake function were measured on intact fine-root branches removed from soil monoliths and the litter layer. CO2 enrichment resulted in the development of a fine-root pool that was less dichotomous and more exploratory under N-limited conditions. The per cent mycorrhizal colonization did not differ among treatments, suggesting that root growth and acclimation to elevated CO2 were quantitatively more important than increased mycorrhizal associations. Our findings emphasize the importance of architectural plasticity in response to environmental change and suggest that changes in root architecture may allow trees to effectively exploit larger volumes of soil, thereby pre-empting progressive nutrient limitations. {\textcopyright} 2014 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - Evidence exists to suggest that mycorrhizal fungi are capable of producing enzymes allowing them to access carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus from complex organic resources in soil.  This facility is mainly demonstrated in ectomycorrhizal and ericaceous endomycorrhizal fungi associated with highly organic soils and climatically stressed environments.  These data support a direct nutrient cycling hypothesis proposed for tropical ectomycorrhizal forests.  In terms of forest succession, the evidence agrees with a major contribution of the mycorrhizal symbiosis in late stages of the succession, where elemental cycling becomes increasingly more conservative and process rates limited by biotic factors.  Here, tree growth benefits from direct nutrient cycling mediated by their mycorrhizal symbionts.

AB  - Detritivorous soil invertebrates process large quantities of leaf litter material. Focusing on decomposer (Oribatida) and predatory mites (Mesostigmata) we investigated the incorporation of resources from leaf litter rich (European beech, Fagus sylvatica) and poor (European ash, Fraxinus excelsior) in structural compounds using stable isotopes. Using litter mixtures we investigated if soil mites preferentially incorporate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) derived from beech or ash leaf litter. Using the rotated-core method we established treatments with and without mycorrhiza as interactions between mycorrhiza and saprotrophic microorganisms may alter the availability of litter resources to soil invertebrates. Conform to our expectations primary decomposers incorporated more C and N than secondary decomposers or predators, but the contribution to body tissue element concentration was low suggesting that they predominantly rely on other resources than litter from the previous year. Generally, soil mites incorporated more C and N from ash than from beech litter, but this was less pronounced after 10 as compared to after 5 months, presumably due to fast decomposition of ash litter. In contrast to our expectations the use of litter resources by soil mites was little affected by mycorrhiza. Overall, the results underline that, at least during the first year of litter decay, leaf litter resources are of minor importance for soil mite nutrition, and this is particularly true for litter rich in structural compounds such as beech.

AB  - The spatiotemporal dynamics of, and interspecific differences in, the acquisition of litter-derived nitrogen (N) by natural assemblages of ectomycorrhizal root tips are poorly understood. Small cylindrical mesh bags containing 15N-labelled beech (Fagus sylvatica) leaf litter that permit hyphal but not root ingrowth were inserted vertically into the top soil layer of an old-growth beech forest. The lateral transfer of 15N into the circumjacent soil, roots, microbes and ectomycorrhizas was measured during an 18-month exposure period. Ectomycorrhial fungi (EMF) showed large interspecific variation in the temporal pattern and extent of 15N accumulation. Initially, when N was mainly available from the leachate, microbes were more efficient at N immobilization than the majority of EMF, but distinct fungal species also showed significant 15N accumulation. During later phases, the enrichment of 15N in Tomentella badia was higher than in microbes and other EMF species. Roots and soil accumulated 15N with a large delay compared with microbes and EMF. Because approximately half of the studied fungal species had direct access to N from leaf litter and the remainder to N from leached compounds, we suggest that EMF diversity facilitates the N utilization of the host by capturing N originating from early-released solutes and late degradation products from a recalcitrant source. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors New Phytologist {\textcopyright} 2013 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - Leaf litter decomposition is a fundamental process involved in soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Observational and experimental evidence suggests that leaf litter from arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree species has a faster decomposition rate than leaf litter from ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree species. This could be due to the diversity and activity of decomposer microorganisms, but remains to be confirmed in subtropical forests. In this study, we compared the effects of fungi and bacteria on decomposition rates of litter from AM and ECM subtropical trees. In the field, we conducted a fungal hyphal exclusion experiment beneath AM and ECM trees. We also used fungicides and bactericides to distinguish the contribution of bacteria and fungi to litter decomposition in a shade-house experiment. Fungi were responsible more leaf litter decay in soil around AM trees than in soil around ECM trees. When fungi were excluded, AM and ECM litters with similar chemical properties decomposed at the same rate, but the AM litters decayed more quickly when saprotrophic fungi were present. Soil around AM trees had more abundance of saprotrophic fungi and greater N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase activities than soil around ECM trees. We conclude that the higher leaf litter decomposition rates under AM trees were due to the saprotrophic fungi in the soil microbial community. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The organic soil horizons of heathland and temperate forest ecosystems are characteristically rich in phenolics, which present barriers to organic N availability to the microflora. The abilities of ectomycorrhizal (ECM), ericoid mycorrhizal and wood decomposing saprotrophic fungi to degrade model compounds representing the insoluble phenolic lignin, and soluble phenolics, which provide physical and chemical barriers respectively to organic N availability, were compared. No clear relationship was found between ability to degrade lignin and soluble phenolics. The presumptive assays indicated that most mycorrhizal fungi have only low abilities to degrade these compounds relative to the wood decomposing fungi. In general, ericoid mycorrhizal fungi were capable of greater phenolic degradation than most ECM species, and degradative ability was associated with production of phenol-oxidizing enzymes. In no case was presumptive degradation of lignin or soluble phenolic, or production of phenol-oxidizing enzymes by mycorrhizal fungi as great as that of the wood decomposing fungi. in the case of the ericoid endophyte Hymenoscyphus ericae, phenol-oxidation was associated with production of an extracellular o-polyphenol oxidase (tyrosinase) which showed optimal activity at a pH of 5-5.5 and temperature of 30 degrees C. The ecological significance of the results is discussed.

AB  - The fate and effects of increased N deposition were investigated by experimental manipulation in a mature Norway spruce plantation at Klosterhede, western Denmark. The ambient N deposition was 15-20 kg Nha(-1)yr(-1). Addition of 35 kg Nha(-1)yr(-1) as ammonium nitrate to a 500-m(2) plot was carried out by handspraying monthly for 4 years. During the first year the spray was labeled with N-15. Tree growth was depressed by 4 successive spring or summer droughts throughout the treatment years. The nitrogen concentration in needles increased in the third year of treatment and critical low P concentrations (0.6-1 mg Pg(-1)) developed possibly as a combined effect of drought and N stress on roots and mycorrhizae. Reduced retranslocation of N was indicated by increased concentration and flux of N in needle litterfall. Increased uptake of N was observed in all parts of the trees and the fraction of the input N taken up was increased from 32 to 43\%, whereas the fraction immobilized in the soil was decreased from 40 to 33\% of the input N. The decomposition remained unchanged, whereas the net N mineralization was increased 85\% over the control. The effect on net mineralization may have resulted from saturation of the immobilization process rather than from an increase in gross mineralization. Soil respiration was not affected, indicating that microbial activity did not respond. Nitrification and denitrification were not important in either control or treated soils. Soil solution chemistry responded promptly to nitrogen applications. Nitrate concentrations increased at all depths, and nitrate leaching increased from < 0.3 to 4.2 kg Nha(-1)yr(-1) by the third year. Reduced biological control on nitrate leaching was indicated by increased nitrate concentration in soil water at the end of the growing season. Ammonium concentrations increased down to 15 cm depth, but all ammonium was retained in the system. Despite the increased nitrate leaching, 92\% of the total inputs were retained. No changes in concentrations of other major ions due to the N additions were detectable. The effects of the successive droughts on growth and nutrient cycling caused significant interaction on the response to N addition. Continuation of the N addition treatment will be necessary to observe the full response of the simulated deposition increase in this forest. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - More than 400 species of vascular plants, in 87 genera, are acholophyllous and heterotrophic, but not directly parasitic upon autotrophs. They are usually, but incorrectly, described as 'saprophytes'since they are in fact nourished by means of specialized mycorrhizal associations. Although distributed world‐wide, they are most abundant and show the greatest species‐richness in the Neotropics and Palaeotropical regions. Their aerial parts range in size from a few centimetres to extensive liane types up to 40 m long. With few exceptions, their habitats are dense moist forests in which there is a surface accumulation of leaf litter, often in situations which are too shaded for autotrophic growth. Although the achlorophyllous mycorrhizal mode of life has evolved independently many times and in widely disparate taxonomic groups, such plants show strong convergent evolution in particular adaptations to their peculiar mode of life. Most prominant amongst these are reductions in the size of seed and embryo, and the lack of differentiation of the embryo at maturity. The number of seeds produced by each flower is typically very large and the shape, structure and surface features of seeds involving adaptation for wind dispersal show remarkable parallels in many species. Specific adaptations for zoochory are rare but well developed in a small number of genera, some of which produce scents like fungal fruit bodies or floral parts which mimic fungal sporocarps. Vegetative parts are often even more conspicuously reduced. Most myco‐heterotrophs are entirely subterranean for most of their lives and these stages exhibit adaptations consistent with a change in function from organs of absorption to organs of storage, shown by the almost universal loss of root hairs, decrease in surface area as exhibited in short cylindric‘vermiform'and tuberous roots or, in extreme cases, the complete suppression of roots and the formation of a swollen tuber or rhizome. Increased width of the root cortex often accommodates mycorrhizal infection and stores of carbohydrates and other materials obtained from the fungal symbiont. Mycorrhizal infection is confined to the below‐ground parts of the plants but may be found there in modified stems as well as in roots. In many genera, stems are exceptionally slender and thread‐like and their vascular tissues are either reduced to a single narrow cylinder of bicollateral bundles or, minimally, to four or six narrow bundles in the cortex. Secondary thickening is poorly developed in all but a tiny minority of species, lignification being confined to annular or, rarely, a few scalariform xylem vessels. Phloem is present in very small amounts and then mainly as parenchyma with sieve tubes frequently recorded as narrow and possibly with abherent sieve plates. Leaves are typically reduced to widely spaced achlorophyllous scales on the inflorescence axis. Occasionally, they are present only on underground rhizomes or tubers. The vascular supply to the leaf‐scales, normally reduced to a single trace, may be absent. Vestigial stomata are sometimes found on leaves and, in a few species which retain traces of chlorophyll, on shoots but, in most fully heterotrophic species, stomata are absent from aerial parts. Since their seeds are very small and contain minimal reserve carbohydrates, the germination of myco‐heterotrophs in nature would appear to depend upon infection by an appropriate symbiotic fungus at an early stage. The nature of the carbohydrates transferred from the fungus to the plants has not been determined. Once acquired from The fungal partner, most plants store carbon in a variety of forms, the most common of which is starch, although other compounds including glucomannan, fructan and calcium oxalate art important in some specks. Asexual reproduction is frequently important with root tubers, tubercles and rhizomes providing the means of vegetative spread. Nonetheless, all the angiospermous species recorded to date also reproduce sexually. Floral structures show varying degrees of reduction concomitant with myco‐heterotrophy. Inflorescences are typically small, often with a single terminal flower, and the floral parts often show extreme simplification, with the production of unilocular or, more rarely, bilocular and trilocular ovaries. In some of the most highly adapted species, there is reduction of integumentary layers surrounding each ovule from the normal bitegmic condition to unitegmic or, occasionally, ategmic. With the principal exception of the Monotropaceae, placentation is typically trimerous and parietal. Flowers normally appear to be cross‐pollinated and are brightly coloured. nectiferous, occasionally scented, and can demonstrate extreme morphological adaptations which attract insects as in the production of lone caudate tepals or fungus‐mimicking structures. Much is still to be learned about the adaptive features and especially about the physiology of these plants and of their early developmental stages during which the essential associations with fungi are established. Similarly, studies of the taxonomy and physiology of most of their fungal partners are still in their infancy. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Niche differentiation for different soil substrates has been proposed as a mechanism contributing to ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity. This hypothesis has been largely untestable because of a lack of techniques to study the in situ distribution of ectomycorrhizal hyphae. We developed a technique involving soil DNA extraction, PCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis for species identification to investigate the vertical distribution of fungal hyphae in four distinct layers of the forest floor (lower litter, F-layer, H-layer, and B-horizon) of a Pinus resinosa plantation. Fungal communities differed markedly among the four layers. Cluster analysis suggested six different patterns of resource utilization: litter-layer specialists, litter-layer generalists, F-layer, H-layer, and B-horizon species, and multilayer generalists. Known ectomycorrhizal species were found in all six clusters. This spatial partitioning observed among ectomycorrhizal fungi along a single, relatively simple substrate-resource gradient supports the niche differentiation hypothesis as an important mechanism contributing to ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity.

AB  - Saprotrophic wood-inhabiting basidiomycetes are the most important decomposers of lignin and cellulose in dead wood and as such they attracted considerable attention. The aims of this work were to quantify the activity and spatial distribution of extracellular enzymes in coarse wood colonised by the white-rot basidiomycete Fomes fomentarius and in adjacent fruitbodies of the fungus and to analyse the diversity of the fungal and bacterial community in a fungus-colonised wood and its potential effect on enzyme production by F. fomentarius. Fungus-colonised wood and fruitbodies were collected in low management intensity forests in the Czech Republic. There were significant differences in enzyme production by F. fomentarius between Betula pendula and Fagus sylvatica wood, the activity of cellulose and xylan-degrading enzymes was significantly higher in beech wood than in birch wood. Spatial analysis of a sample B. pendula log segment proved that F. fomentarius was the single fungal representative found in the log. There was a high level of spatial variability in the amount of fungal biomass detected, but no effects on enzyme activities were observed. Samples from the fruiting body showed high $\beta$-glucosidase and chitinase activities compared to wood samples. Significantly higher levels of xylanase and cellobiohydrolase were found in samples located near the fruitbody (proximal), and higher laccase and Mn-peroxidase activities were found in the distal ones. The microbial community in wood was dominated by the fungus (fungal to bacterial DNA ratio of 62-111). Bacterial abundance composition was lower in proximal than distal parts of wood by a factor of 24. These results show a significant level of spatial heterogeneity in coarse wood. One of the explanations may be the successive colonization of wood by the fungus: due to differential enzyme production, the rates of biodegradation of coarse wood are also spatially inhomogeneous. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - We investigated the link between aboveground and belowground diversity in temperate deciduous forest ecosystems. To this end, we determined the effects of the tree species composition on the biomass and composition of the soil microbial community using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles in the Hainich National Park, a deciduous mixed forest on loess over limestone in Central-Germany. We investigated the effects of the leaf litter composition on the microbial community, hypothesizing that distinctive leaf litter compositions increase signature PLFAs. In addition, we studied the impact of clay content, pH and nutrient status of the soil on the microbial community in different surface soil layers. Consequently, soil was sampled from depths of 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm and 10-20 cm. Plots with highest leaf litter diversity had the largest total amounts of fatty acids, but only PLFA 16:1 omega 5, which is a common marker for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, was significantly increased. In the uppermost soil layer, the pH explained most of the variance in microbial composition. In the deeper surface soil layers, nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus determined the microbial abundances and composition. Our results suggest that the soil microbial community is mainly indirectly influenced by aboveground diversity. Changes in soil pH or the soil nutrient status that are driven by specific plant traits like leave litter quality drive these indirect changes. Specific direct interactions are most reasonable for mycorrhizal fungi. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Allelopathy is one of the factors that determine interactions among plants. Allelochemicals have been found in many forest ecosystems, but the importance of allelopathy depends on forest type and environmental conditions. Despite the wide presence of this phenomenon, few forest models have incorporated a representation of allelopathy, but its inclusion should be considered in forest models dealing with environmental stress, exotic plant invasions and ecological succession. Multiple factors influence allelochemical production and toxicity, including nutrient availability, soil moisture and texture, solar radiation, and temperature. Ecosystem-level effects of allelopathy include changes in germination rates, inhibition of seedling growth, mycorrhizal function, insect and bacterial growth, inhibition of nitrification or litterfall decomposition and dieback of mature trees. To illustrate some potential consequences of incorporation some aspects of allelopathy, in an ecosystem-level model, a virtual experiment was carried out with the forest ecosystem-level model FORECAST. This revealed different effects of allelopathy on several ecological variables depending on the type of allelopathic influence simulated. In addition, this experiment showed the utility of ecosystem-level models to simulate, if not directly the allelopathic interactions, at least the ecological effects of allelopathy at the ecosystem level. Overall, my work points out that researchers and forest managers should think carefully about the need to include allelopathy as a way of improving the accuracy of forest models and ecosystem-based decision support tools. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rapid responses of microbial biomass and community composition following a precipitation event have been reported for soil bacteria and fungi, but measurements characterizing ectomycorrhizal fungi remain limited. The response of ectomycorrhizal fungi after a precipitation event is crucial to understanding biogeochemical cycles and plant nutrition. Here, we examined changes in ectomycorrhizal formation, diversity, and community composition at the end of a summer drought and following precipitation events in a conifer–oak mixed forest under a semiarid, Mediterranean-type climate in CA, USA. To study the effects of different amounts of precipitation, a water addition treatment was also undertaken. Ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and community composition changed within 6 days following precipitation, with increased simultaneous mortality and re-growth. Ectomycorrhizal diversity increased and community composition changed both in the natural rainfall (less than 10 mm) and water addition (50 mm) treatments, but larger decreases in ectomycorrhizal diversity were observed from 9 to 16 days after precipitation in the water addition treatment. The changes were primarily a shift in richness and abundance of Basidiomycota species, indicating higher drought sensitivity of Basidiomycota species compared with Ascomycota species. Our results indicate that ectomycorrhizal formation, diversity, and community composition rapidly respond to both precipitation events and to the amount of precipitation. These changes affect ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling, decomposition, and plant nutrient uptake, in semiarid regions. {\textcopyright} 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The soil is a heterogeneous medium with respect to decomposition activity and consequently with respect to nutrient availability. Roots of forest trees and hyphae of vesiculararbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi, principal nutrient absorbing organs, have previously been observed to associate with decomposing organic matter and other localized sites of nutrient availability in the soil. In two experiments in forests on contrasting soil types in Brazilian Amazonia, the association of tree roots with decomposing organic matter was shown to be a response of new root growth in the organic matter, not an avoidance of unfavorable conditions elsewhere in the soil volume. In laboratory experiments, the growth of VAM fungal hyphae was shown to respond to particles of decomposing organic matter in a way analogous to the response of forest tree roots. In both cases localized nutrient-rich sites (organic matter) were encountered by random growth of individual roots (hyphae) followed by increased branching after the encounter. Length of roots (and probably of hyphae) followed the negative binomial distribution, which is also found in other spatially aggregated organisms in heterogeneous environments. Although roots and hyphae operate in different size scales, the selective exploitation of localized nutrient-rich sites and the mechanism by which the advantageous physical placement comes about is strikingly similar. The highly branched roots and hyphae in association with decomposing organic matter should be advantageous when ion uptake is limited by either diffusion rate or competition with other organisms. {\textcopyright} 1983 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W.

AB  - Species richness and sporocarp density of ectomycorrhizal fungi in stands of Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) in The Netherlands have decreased during the last decades. The lowest species diversity was found in P. sylvestris stands situated in areas with high atmospheric deposition of nitrogen originating from intensive livestock industry. In these stands, litter and humus have accumulated into thick layers, and the herbaceous understory vegetation is dominated by the grass Deschampsia flexuosa (wavy hair grass). Earlier investigations showed negative correlations between the number of species of ectomycorrhizal fungi above ground and the depth of humus layers. Our aim was to investigate whether removal of lifter, humus layers, and herbaceous vegetation (sods)-so-called ``sod cutting{''}-increased species diversity above ground and sporocarp density of ectomycorrhizal fungi in P. sylvestris stands of different age. Therefore, three P. sylvestris stands of different ages (planted in 1987, 1963, and 1924) on Haplic Arenosol were selected. In 1990, litter, humus layers, and herbaceous vegetation were removed to create nutrient-poor sandy soils without overlying lifter and humus layers. Untreated plots served as controls. Surveys conducted in 1991, 1992, and 1993 indicated that sod cutting enhanced the species diversity and sporocarp density of ectomycorrhizal fungi. These results suggest that sod cutting is a way to restore ectomycorrhizal nora in medium-aged and old stands of P. sylvestris where litter and humus have accumulated.

AB  - Plant seasonal cycles alter carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) availability for soil microbes, which may affect microbial community composition and thus feed back on microbial decomposition of soil organic material and plant N availability. The temporal dynamics of these plant-soil interactions are, however, unclear. Here, we experimentally manipulated the C and N availability in a beech forest through N fertilization or tree girdling and conducted a detailed analysis of the seasonal pattern of microbial community composition and decomposition processes over 2 yr. We found a strong relationship between microbial community composition and enzyme activities over the seasonal course. Phenoloxidase and peroxidase activities were highest during late summer, whereas cellulase and protease peaked in late autumn. Girdling, and thus loss of mycorrhiza, resulted in an increase in soil organic matter-degrading enzymes and a decrease in cellulase and protease activity. Temporal changes in enzyme activities suggest a switch of the main substrate for decomposition between summer (soil organic matter) and autumn (plant litter). Our results indicate that ectomycorrhizal fungi are possibly involved in autumn cellulase and protease activity. Our study shows that, through belowground C allocation, trees significantly alter soil microbial communities, which may affect seasonal patterns of decomposition processes. {\textcopyright} The Authors (2010).

AB  - Fine root processes play a prominent role in the carbon and nutrient cycling of boreal ecosystems due to the high proportion of biomass allocated belowground and the rapid decomposition of fine roots relative to aboveground tissues. To examine these issues in detail, major components of ecosystem carbon flux were studied in three mature black spruce forests in interior Alaska, where fine root production, respiration, mortality and decomposition, and aboveground production of trees, shrubs, and mosses were measured relative to soil CO2 fluxes. Fine root production, measured over a two-year period using minirhizotrons, varied from 0.004 ± 0.001 mm{\textperiodcentered}cm -2{\textperiodcentered}d-1 over winter, to 0.051 ± 0.015 mm{\textperiodcentered}cm-2{\textperiodcentered}d-1 during July, with peak growing season values comparable to those reported for many temperate forests using similar methods. On average, 84% of this production occurred within 20 cm of the moss surface, although the proportion occurring in deeper profiles increased as soils gradually warmed throughout the summer. Monthly rates of production and mortality were somewhat asynchronous because mortality tended to peak during fall and be minimal during periods of peak production. Production and mortality were, however, positively correlated across all tubes and time periods. Annual fine root production averaged 2.45 ± 0.31, 8.01 ± 1.39, and 2.53 ± 0.27 mm{\textperiodcentered}cm-2{\textperiodcentered}yr-1 (means ± 1 SE) among the three sites, when averaged across years. Fine root survival and decomposition were measured by tracking and analyzing the fate of individual fine roots using mark-recapture techniques. Fine root survival was greatest during periods of peak root growth, and least over winter ($\Phi$time). Roots first appearing in the middle of the growing season had higher survival rates than those first appearing early or late in the growing season, or over winter ($\Phi$cohort), and risk of mortality decreased with root age ($\Phi$age). Survival estimates translate to mean life spans of 108 ± 4 d during the growing season. While these values are in striking contrast to needle longevity and rates of aboveground litter decomposition, they are similar to many values found for temperate systems, supporting the notion that there are basic morphological and physiological traits of first-order roots that are common to most woody plant root systems. During the growing season, monthly fine root decomposition rates averaged 0.46 ± 0.01 per month, while decomposition rates over winter averaged 0.73 ± 0.01 per winter. These growing season estimates translate to 49 ± 2 d from the time a root was first observed as dead, to the time it disappeared. For roots that decomposed during the growing season, those with longer life spans decomposed more slowly after death. Comparing these results with other minirhizotron studies suggests that life-history traits of black spruce first-order roots are similar to those from temperate (and perhaps most) forest ecosystems. Annual production of fine roots averaged 228 ± 75 g biomass{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}yr-1, constituting ∼56% of total stand production. Aboveground production of trees (50 ± 14 g biomass{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}yr-1, 13%) and shrubs (40 ± 2 g biomass{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}yr -1, 11%) contributed similarly to total production, while mosses (73 ± 14 g biomass{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}yr-1, 20%) accounted for the largest component of aboveground production. Soil temperature had a strong control over both soil respiration (Q10 = 2.21 ± 0.31) and root respiration (Q10 = 2.30 ± 0.37). During the growing season (15 May to 15 September), ∼56% of soil CO2 efflux (580 ± 40 g C/m2) was derived from fine root respiration (329 ± 54 g C/m2). Although apparent rates of heterotrophic respiration (May through September) and total production did not differ, definitive estimates of net ecosystem production are impossible given the potentially large, unmeasured components of NPP (net primary production), such as root exudation and mycorrhizal production. Nevertheless, rates of fine root production, mortality, and decomposition indicate that in these black spruce ecosystems, fine roots are much more dynamic than would be predicted from patterns of aboveground processes, and that carbon, and presumably nutrients, are cycling through fine roots at rates several orders of magnitude faster than through aboveground tissues.

AB  - Soil nutrient availability can strongly affect root traits. In tropical forests, phosphorus (P) is often considered the main limiting nutrient for plants. However, support for the P paradigm is limited, and N and cations might also control tropical forests functioning. We used a large-scale experiment to determine how the factorial addition of nitrogen (N), P and cations affected root productivity and traits related to nutrient acquisition strategies (morphological traits, phosphatase activity, arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation and nutrient contents) in a primary rainforest growing on low-fertility soils in Central Amazonia after 1 yr of fertilisation. Multiple root traits and productivity were affected. Phosphorus additions increased annual root productivity and root diameter, but decreased root phosphatase activity. Cation additions increased root productivity at certain times of year, also increasing root diameter and mycorrhizal colonisation. P and cation additions increased their element concentrations in root tissues. No responses were detected with N addition. Here we showed that rock-derived nutrients determined root functioning in low-fertility Amazonian soils, demonstrating not only the hypothesised importance of P, but also highlighting the role of cations. The changes in fine root traits and productivity indicated that even slow-growing tropical rainforests can respond rapidly to changes in resource availability. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The mechanistic links between nitrogen (N) availability and investment in plant phosphorus (P) acquisition have important implications for plant growth, species distributions, and responses to CO2 fertilization under global change, especially in P-poor tropical ecosystems. Currently, it is unclear whether investment in strategies that enhance plant P acquisition (arbuscular mycorrhizal, AM; colonization or root phosphatase activity, RPA) are determined primarily by phylogeny, or whether these strategies differ among N2-fixing legumes and nonfixing plants as a result of differing N availability. We hypothesized that plant N status, which can vary widely independent of N fixation, correlates with investment in P acquisition, because: (a) N and P concentrations scale in plant tissue indicative of coupled demand and (b) plants with more N may have more resources available to allocate to acquisition strategies. We grew seedlings of eight tropical tree species from three families (including three N2-fixing and one nonfixing legume) under greenhouse conditions in native forest soil for four months. Species represented almost the full range of foliar N observed in tropical trees. Neither foliar N nor P concentrations correlated with investment in P acquisition. Across all species, we found an inverse relationship between investment in AM colonization and RPA, but this trade-off was unrelated to foliar N or P and did not differ between functional types (i.e., N2 fixers vs. nonfixers). Within legumes (family Fabaceae), two strategies were evident that were unrelated to fixation status. High-fixing Inga and nonfixing Dialium displayed high foliar N and P concentrations and greater proportional investment in RPA versus AM, while lower fixing Ormosia species were characterized by lower foliar nutrient concentrations and proportionally more investment in AM. Synthesis.Investment in P acquisition strategies in tropical trees is not dependent on foliar N or functional group, but instead may be controlled in part by resource trade-offs. High diversity in nutrient strategies between related species cautions again the use of simple functional groupings to draw conclusions about nutrient acquisition in tropical trees. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Forest ecosystems with low soil nitrogen (N) availability are characterized by direct competition for this growth-limiting resource between several players, i.e. various components of vegetation, such as old-growth trees, natural regeneration and understorey species, mycorrhizal fungi, free-living fungi and bacteria. With the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme climate events predicted in current climate change scenarios, also competition for N between plants and/or soil microorganisms will be affected. In this review, we summarize the present understanding of ecosystem N cycling in N-limited forests and its interaction with extreme climate events, such as heat, drought and flooding. More specifically, the impacts of environmental stresses on microbial release and consumption of bioavailable N, N uptake and competition between plants, as well as plant and microbial uptake are presented. Furthermore, the consequences of drying-wetting cycles on N cycling are discussed. Additionally, we highlight the current methodological difficulties that limit present understanding of N cycling in forest ecosystems and the need for interdisciplinary studies. {\textcopyright} 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.

AB  - Fires are critical pathways of carbon loss from boreal forest soils, whereas microbial communities form equally critical controls over carbon accumulation between fires. We used a chronosequence in Alaska to test Read's hypothesis that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi should dominate ecosystems with low accumulation of surface litter, and ectomycorrhizal fungi should proliferate where organic horizons are well-developed. This pattern is expected because ectomycorrhizal fungi display a greater capacity to mineralize organic compounds than do arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The sites were located in upland forests near Delta Junction, Alaska, and represent stages at 3, 15, 45, and 80 years following fire. Soil organic matter accumulated 2.8-fold over time. Fire did not noticeably reduce the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In contrast, ectomycorrhizal colonization required up to 15 years to return to pre-fire levels. As a result, dominant mycorrhizal groups shifted from arbuscular to ectomycorrhizal fungi as succession progressed. Bacterial functional diversity was greatest in the oldest sites. Altogether, microbes that can mineralize organic compounds (i.e., ectomycorrhizae and bacteria) recovered more slowly than those that cannot (i.e., arbuscular mycorrhizae). Potential net N mineralization and standing pools of ammonium-N were relatively low in the youngest site. In addition, glomalin stocks were positively correlated with arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal length, peaking early in the chronosequence. Our results indicate that microbial succession may influence soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in the first several years following fire, by augmenting carbon storage in glomalin while inhibiting mineralization of organic compounds.

AB  - Strict Forest Reserves can play an important role in the conservation and development of botanical richness in forests. Especially the high amount of dead wood, composed of all dimensional classes and decomposition stages, performs as a suitable substrate for often specialized species of vascular plants, fungi and mosses. An international research programme was conceived to analyse this botanical richness, more specifically on dead wood of beech. In this paper some general preliminary results for the research site in the Zoni{\"{e}}n-forest are presented.

AB  - The effect of site preparation (mixed mounding and removal of the humus layer) under a shelterwood of mixed boreal forest along a forest interior-edge gradient on Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings was studied two years after planting. Mounds had a positive effect on root development, ectomycorrhiza formation and the absorption of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the seedlings, and augmented their survival, growth and biomass. Humus removal had an adverse effect on the root biomass and ectomycorrhiza formation. A decreased soil fertility after the removal of humus led to a low N and P content in the seedlings. Two years after planting, humus removal had not affected the growth of the seedlings, but reduced their biomass. The influence of the forest edge, compared to the interior plot, was mostly associated with a decrease in the stand density, reduced amount of litter and increased light availability for the seedlings. {\textcopyright} 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Wood decay elements include snags, down wood, root wads, tree stumps, litter, duff, broomed or diseased branches, and partially dead trees, all of which contribute to ecological processes and biodiversity of the forest ecosystem. Down wood can serve as reservoirs for moisture and mycorrhizal fungi beneficial to the health and growth of commercial tree species. Decaying wood, leaf litter, small twigs, and roots contribute nutrients and structure to humus and soil organic matter, and host microbes that play beneficial roles in nitrogen cycles and other processes. Snags and down wood provide nurse functions for tree and shrub species, and can aid in restoration of degraded forest environments. Various elements of wood decay provide habitat for many species of wildlife including invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Fire can influence the amounts and distributions of wood decay elements and enhance or detract desired ecosystem processes, depending on severity, charring, soil temperature, and other factors. Managing wood decay elements for ecosystem processes entails better understanding decay dynamics, the role of coarse wood in soil, the role of wood decay in carbon cycling and sequestration, and other considerations. {\textcopyright} 2017 by American Scientific Publishers.

AB  - A survey of the biodiversity of wild macrofungi, including edible species yields, was carried out from 1 May to 30 September 2007 at four different forest types (in mainly Miang tea forest). The plots 100 m2, comprised a tea garden with a few planted canopy tree species (37.2% canopy cover), a cultivated sustainable tea forest (80.2% canopy cover), an abandoned sustainable tea forest (89.8% canopy cover), and an abandoned sustainable tea forest that had suffered fire damage (72.9% canopy cover). All visible mushrooms were collected during weekly forays. Macro-characters of the fungi were annotated and photographed by digital camera and the fungi were identified to genera and morphospecies (e.g. Agaricus sp.1, Agaricus sp.2). The fresh weight of wild edible mushrooms produced in the plots was also recorded during this period. The biodiversity of macrofungi in abandoned sustainable tea forest was highest with 115 species in 47 genera, followed by cultivated sustainable tea forest with 85 species in 42 genera and fire damaged abandoned sustainable tea forest with 48 species in 25 genera, while only 19 species belonging to 15 genera were found in the tea garden. Twenty-one species belonging to nine genera with a total of 60.9 kg of edible fungi were collected throughout this study. The fresh weight of edible mushrooms was recorded with the highest fresh weight (25.3 kg) collected from the abandoned sustainable tea forest, followed by 18.2 kg in the cultivated sustainable tea forest, while in the fire damaged sustainable tea forest 16.4 kg were collected and only 1 kg was collected in the tea garden. Abandoned sustainable tea forest contained a greater shade tree biodiversity and higher canopy cover than other plots. This area has a generally higher humidity, a greater ground litter cover, a greater number of microhabitats, a greater number of trees that can form mycorrhizal associations and this probably accounts for the higher diversity of macrofungi and production of edible mushrooms. The fire damaged sustainable tea forest had lower mushroom diversity and edible mushroom production possibly due to the loss of litter and lower tree diversity. The tea garden supported a poor diversity of mushrooms and almost no edible mushrooms. Shade tea forest (Miang tea forest) is a good method to produce tea in a sustainable way as it maintains diversity of mushrooms and other organisms and could be developed as an alternative to shade coffee. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

AB  - Coarse wood provides important ecosystem structure and function such as water and nutrient storage and critical habitat for the conservation of a variety of organisms, including ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. The chemistry and EM communities were compared in coarse wood samples collected from two advanced decay stages of logs in 12 paired young and old-growth stands in the Oregon Cascade Range. Average total C and nonpolar extractives were higher in young stands (15-55 years) (mean = 53.38%, 95% CI of 52.48-54.27 and mean = 8.54%, 95% CI of 6.92-10.16, respectively) compared with old-growth stands (200-500 years) (mean = 51.22%, 95% CI of 49.67-52.77 and mean = 6.75%, 95% CI of 5.88-7.62, respectively). Averages for total and extractable P were higher in old-growth stands (mean = 0.03%, 95% CI of 0.02-0.04 and mean = 82.91, 95% CI of 52.24-113.57, respectively) compared with young stands (mean = 0.02%, 95% CI of 0.02-0.02 and mean = 56.17, 95% CI of 45.84-66.50, respectively). Average pH and total N were highest in logs in the most advanced decay stage (mean = 4.17, 95% CI of 3.97-4.38 and mean = 0.35%, 95% CI of 0.29-0.40, respectively). No differences between log decay class or stand age were detected for water-soluble extractives, hemicellulose plus cellulose (or acid-hydrolyzable fraction), or acid-unhydrolyzable residue. Observed differences in average wood property values between decay stages and between young and old-growth stands were small and, although statistically significant, may not reflect an important difference in EM fungal habitat. EM communities were similar between young and old-growth stands and between logs in decay classes 4 and 5. Results suggest that down wood in advanced decay stages provides similar habitat for EM fungi in both old-growth and young, managed stands. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC.

AB  - The ability of the mycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus to mobilize nitrogen and phosphorus from discrete patches of beech (Fagus sylvatica), birch (Betula pendula) and pine (Pinus sylvestris) litter collected from the fermentation horizon of three forest soils, and to transfer the nutrients to colonized B. pendula Roth seedlings, was investigated in transparent observation chambers. The mycelium of P. involutus foraged intensively in all three types of litter, leading to a significant decline in their phosphorus contents after 90 d. Over the same period only one of the litter types, beech, showed more than a 10\% loss of its N contents. Exploitation of the litter led to invigoration of the vegetative mycelium of the fungus throughout the chambers as well as to significant increases of biomass production and leaf area in seedlings grown in the plus litter (+ L) relative to those in minus litter (- L) systems. The yield increases were associated with gains in whole plant tissue content and concentration of P, but in content only in the case of N. Calculations suggest that a major proportion of the phosphorus lost from litter originated in its organic fraction. The possible basis of the discrepancy between values of N loss from litter and gain by the plant is discussed and the extent to which the distinctive pattern of nutrient mobilization is a feature peculiar to this fungus-plant combination is considered. It is concluded that nutrient mobilization from natural organic substrates in the fermentation horizon of forest soils may be a key function of the vegetative mycelium of mycorrhizal systems. The need for experimental analyses of a greater range of fungus-plant partnerships is stressed.

AB  - Host trees can modify their soil abiotic conditions through their leaf fall quality which in turn may influence the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community composition. We investigated this indirect interaction using a causal modelling approach. We identified ECM fungi on the roots of two coexisting oak species growing in two forests in southern Spain - Quercus suber (evergreen) and Quercus canariensis (winter deciduous)-using a PCR-based molecular method. We also analysed the leaf fall, litter and soil sampled beneath the tree canopies to determine the concentrations of key nutrients. The total mycorrhizal pool was comprised of 69 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Tomentella and Russula were the most species-rich, frequent and abundant genera. ECM fungi with epigeous and resupinate fruiting bodies were found in 60% and 34% of the identified mycorrhizas, respectively. The calcium content of litter, which was significantly higher beneath the winter-deciduous oak species due to differences in leaf fall quality, was the most important variable for explaining ECM species distribution. The evaluation of alternative causal models by the d-sep method revealed that only those considering indirect leaf fall-mediated host effects statistically matched the observed covariation patterns between host, environment (litter, topsoil, subsoil) and fungal community variables. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi from Pinus yunnanensis forests, a dominant vegetation type in central Yunnan and adjacent regions, were sampled from 2000-2005. A total of 834 mushroom collections representing 211 taxa in 39 genera and 27 families were obtained and identified. Of these, Russula, Boletus, Lactarius, Suillus, Tricholoma, Cantharellus and Thelephora were the dominant genera. Our ecological surveys indicate that EM fungal fruiting and distribution patterns are strongly affected by climate (e. g., air temperature and precipitation), vegetation (e. g., stand age, crown density and herbaceous vegetation); soil conditions (e. g., pH; litter and humus layers), topographic features (e. g., altitude; position and steepness of slopes) and human disturbance (e. g., commercial harvesting; logging; fire and residue removal). The 4 primary findings were: (1) There was a consistent seasonal variation in the number of EM fungi associated with Pinus yunnanensis. Over the 5-year period; the lowest numbers of EM fungi were found during the winter months of January; February; and March. This number rose rapidly during the spring and peaked in mid and late summer. (2)The abundance; composition; and richness of EM fungi significantly increased with increasing altitude between 1500-2100 m; and then slightly decreased up to 2500 m. Usually a species was found only within a particular range of altitudes. (3) EM fungal richness increases as the host matures. The tendency is to find greater numbers of EM species associated with older Pinus yunnanensis stands. This increase in EM fungi with maturing of host stands may be related to changes in available photosynthate; root exudates and soil conditions. (4) Human disturbance has a major negative impact on EM fungi species richness; abundance; and community composition. Large-scale harvesting directly affected the production of fruit bodies; either by damaging or exhausting mycelia; shifting competitive relations with other species; or by causing reproductive failure due to decreased spore production. EM fungi richness declined with increased fire severity and logging intensity. Both litter and humus layers and grass density appeared to affect sporocarp production with litter depth and EM fungi sporocarp abundance being negatively correlated. Sporocarps of EM fungi were scarce in Pinus yunnanensis stands dominated by the grass Eupatorium adenophorum.

AB  - The breakdown of organic nitrogen in soil is a potential rate-limiting step in nitrogen cycling. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are root symbionts that might improve the ability of plants to compete for organic nitrogen products against other decomposer microbes. However, AM uptake of organic nitrogen, especially in natural systems, has traditionally been difficult to test. We developed a novel quantitative nanotechnological technique to determine in situ that organic nitrogen uptake by AM fungi can occur to a greater extent than has previously been assumed. Specifically, we found that AM fungi acquired recalcitrant and labile forms of organic nitrogen. Moreover, N enrichment of soil reduced plot-scale uptake of these compounds. Since most plants host AM fungi, AM use of organic nitrogen could widely influence plant productivity, especially where N availability is relatively low. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Removal of annual litter fall during two consecutive years in a Swedish beech forest increased the sporophore production of mycorrhizal Russula species considerably in both years, whereas sporophore production by most decomposer agarics was greatly reduced. In plots supplied with twice the annual amount of litter, Mycena capillaris was more abundant than in untreated control plots, otherwise sporophore production of decomposers was usually greatest in the controls. {\textcopyright} 1991, British Mycological Society.

AB  - A Mg isotope study of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) in a field site in southern Quebec, Canada, and seedlings grown in sterile soil substrate in the laboratory, both demonstrate per mil level within-tree Mg isotope fractionation. However, only sugar maple seedlings grown in the laboratory fractionate Mg isotopes during uptake into fine roots, favoring heavy isotope enrichment in the plant compared to the growth medium. Absence of uptake-related Mg isotope fractionation in field stands of sugar maple is tentatively attributed to the activities of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that colonize fine roots of the trees in the field, but were absent from the laboratory grown specimens. The fungi facilitate nutrient uptake for the tree, while the tree provides valuable carbohydrates to the fungi. Without the symbiotic fungi, pot-grown trees in the laboratory are visibly stressed and often die. The mechanisms responsible for Mg isotopic fractionation in stressed trees remain to be elucidated. Rivers are isotopically light compared to bedrock weathering sources of Mg, and this has bearing on the delta Mg-26 value of the continental weathering flux of Mg to the oceans, which is an important parameter in studies of ocean Mg cycling in the geological past. If uptake-related fractionation is negligible in many other naturally growing tree species, as it is in sugar maple, then forest growth will exert little or no influence on the delta Mg-26 value of the export flux of Mg to first-order streams and rivers, and in turn the ocean Mg cycle. Above the tree line, preferential retention of heavy Mg isotopes in clay minerals formed during silicate weathering has been linked to the low delta Mg-26 values in rivers. In the forested catchment of this study there is no clear evidence for these effects. The 1 N HNO3 leach of the Bf-BC and C mineral soils, which are often used to identify minerals that may be releasing Mg and other base cations to plant-available pools, have the same average delta Mg-26 value (-0.66 parts per thousand, n = 2) as the litter layer and exchangeable leach of the forest floor, all soil solutions, and the stream (-0.63 +/- 0.17 parts per thousand 2 sigma, n = 23). More revealing is the molar Mg/Ca ratio of the 1 N HNO3 treatment (0.17), which is nearly identical to the bulk Mg/Ca ratio of the aboveground biomass (0.14). We conclude that the 1 N HNO3 leach in this setting releases Mg from secondary minerals, such as vermiculite, other clays, and amorphous phases, which have taken up plant-recycled Mg and Ca that has filtered down through the soil from the litter layer of the forest floor. A single mineral, chlorite, with an estimated delta Mg-26 value of -0.78\%e, appears to be responsible for supplying most of the Mg that is circulating between the forest and soils in this setting, which is weathered and cached over timescales of thousands of years.

AB  - Background and aim – Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities are a main component of soil. They could be an indicator of fertility of semi-arid ecosystems. We aimed to analyse the biodiversity of AMF and understorey plants in Zagros forest (Iran), and to find their relationships with environmental conditions (physiography and soil). Methods – Seventy-five plots (20 m × 20 m) were randomly divided from 1 700 to 1 900 m a.s.l. In each plot, four 1.5 m × 1.5 m microplots were established and all trees, shrubs, and herbaceous species coverage were recorded. Furthermore, four soil samples were taken from a depth of 0–20 cm in each microplot (one pooled sample for each main plot) by auger in spring. These soil samples were used for AMF assessment and soil physiochemical properties. Results – Seventeen AMF species (in Glomeraceae, Claroideoglomeraceae, Diversisporaceae, Gigasporaceae, and Acaulosporaceae) and 47 plant taxa (in Poaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae and fourteen other families) were identified. Tests determined that the factors soil P, slope, tree coverage, litter thickness, and soil texture affect AMF and plant communities. Soil physiochemical properties have an effect on AMF, plant diversity, and evenness diversity indices. Furthermore, there is a high correlation between plants and AMF diversity indices and any change in the plant diversity will result in AMF changes. The results also showed positive correlations between plant diversity and AMF diversity. Conclusions – AMF and plant diversity indices are highly correlated, but this correlation could be affected by soil physiochemical properties and environmental factors. Moreover, canopy coverage and litter thickness are considered as strongly influencing both plants and AMF. {\textcopyright} 2017 Botanic Garden Meise and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal mycelial necromass is an important source of carbon for free-living microorganisms in forest soils, yet we know little either of its fate when it enters soil or of the identity of microbes that are able to utilise mycelium as their energy source. Here we used C-13-labelled mycelium of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus microcarpus in laboratory incubations in combination with DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) to determine the identity of functionally active soil fungi that can utilise dead mycelium. We also used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to detect parallel changes in the abundance of key biochemical constituents of soil. A decrease in bulk soil C-13 concentration together with rapid loss of glycogen and chitin-glucan during the 4 week incubations suggested that dead mycelium was rapidly turned over. Further, C-13 was incorporated into fungal DNA within 7 days of addition to soil. DNA-SIP also revealed a dynamic community of functionally active soil fungi. By applying DNA-SIP and NMR in parallel, our data show that carbon from decaying ectomycorrhizal mycelium is rapidly transformed and incorporated into free-living soil fungi. This finding emphasises that dead extramatrical mycelium is an important source of labile carbon for soil microorganisms. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The neodymium isotope ratios (143Nd/144Nd) and rare earth element compositions of eight plant species in a wellstudied Ca-depleted research forest (the Strengbach catchment) were measured. The 143Nd/144Nd ratios distributed between the higher ratio of apatite and the lower ratio of plagioclase. The ratio correlated well with the type of infected fungi. Ectomycorrhizae (EM)-infected plants tended to show lower isotope ratios than Ect-uninfected plants. This is supported by the REE abundance patterns: Higher 143Nd/144Nd plants tend to show a more negative Eu anomaly. Based on the reported soil profile, the Nd isotope ratio of the surface soil is considered to be influenced significantly by Nd in plant litter. Combining Nd isotope and Eu anomaly data, the REE cycle in the catchment can largely be understood by mixing three endmembers of Ca-bearing plagioclase, apatite and carbonate in loess. EM-infected plants are estimated to incorporate 50-70% of Nd ultimately from plagioclase, whereas for non EM-infected plants, less than 30% of Nd is from plagioclase, perhaps indirectly from the recycled pool. Comparison of the results with reported mineral soil profiles and REE composition of acid leachates of soil indicates that plagioclase is dissolved by the symbiotic action of ectomycorrhizae, providing a direct evidence of active plant-induced weathering in a natural system. It is likely that plants dissolve plagioclase to compensate for insufficient Ca in soil. {\textcopyright} 2017 by The Geochemical Society of Japan.

AB  - • Ectomycorrhizas may interact with saprotrophic microorganisms to influence decomposition. These interactions are poorly understood. • We buried mesh envelopes filled with either litter or F-layer material in the forest floor of a Pinus resinosa plantation. After 16 months we characterized decomposition, C : N ratio, water content, and the density of four ectomycorrhiza morphotypes. • For both substrates there were negative correlations between ectomycorrhiza density and decomposition, and between ectomycorrhiza density and water content. The relative proportion of morphotypes was significantly different in litter and F-layer material buried at the same depth in the forest floor. • We conclude that the negative effect of ectomycorrhizas on decomposition could be mediated by extraction of water, particularly in relatively dry years. The 'Gadgil effect' may be explained by this phenomenon. In wetter years, water extraction may be less consequential. Also, variation in substrate quality may influence the structure of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities.

AB  - To better understand how management and restoration practices influence the response of terrestrial ecosystems to large-scale disturbances, it is critical to study above- and belowground effects. In this study, we examined the immediate effect of a major hurricane on aboveground forest structure, arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) and belowground carbon pools in experimentally thinned plots in a tropical forest. The hurricane occurred five years after a thinning treatment, when thinned plots had similar aboveground carbon stocks but different forest structure compared to control plots. Thinned plots had more large diameter (>10 cm) trees compared to the control plots, which were characterized by a higher density of small diameter (<10 cm) trees. Despite pre-hurricane differences in forest structure, there were no significant differences between treatments in changes of canopy openness or number of affected trees following the hurricane. Thinned plots had larger belowground carbon pools than the controls plots before the hurricane, and these differences remained after the hurricane despite rapid decomposition of organic matter rich in nitrogen. There were no pre-hurricane differences in AM fungal spores or total AM root colonization. The hurricane reduced AM sporulation by nearly 50% in both treatments, yet we observed a significant increase in AM root colonization after the hurricane with greater AM colonization in the thinned plots. Hurricanes have well-known visible aboveground effects, but here we showed that less visible belowground effects are influenced by forest management and may play an important role in forest recovery. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).

AB  - In this article we discuss the possible significance of biological processes, and of fungi in particular, in weathering of minerals. We consider biological activity to be a significant driver of mineral weathering in forest ecosystems. In these environments fungi play key roles in organic matter decomposition, uptake, transfer and cycling of organic and inorganic nutrients, biogenic mineral formation, as well as transformation and accumulation of metals. The ability of lichens, mutualistic symbioses between fungi and photobionts such as algae or cyanobacteria, to weather minerals is well documented. The role of mycorrhizal fungi forming symbioses with forest trees is less well understood, but the mineral horizons of boreal forests are intensively colonised by mycorrhizal mycelia which transfer protons and organic metabolites derived from plant photosynthates to mineral surfaces, resulting in mineral dissolution and mobilisation and redistribution of anionic nutrients and metal cations. The mycorrhizal mycelia, in turn provide efficient systems for the uptake and direct transport of mobilised essential nutrients to their host plants which are large sinks. Since almost all (99.99. %) non-suberised lateral plant roots involved in nutrient uptake are covered by ectomycorrhizal fungi, most of this exchange of metabolites must take place through the plant-fungus interface. This idea is still consistent with a linear relationship between soil mineral surface area and weathering rate since the mycelia that emanate from the tree roots will have a larger area of contact with minerals if the mineral surface area is higher. Although empirical models based on bulk soil solution chemistry may fit field data, we argue that biological processes make an important contribution to mineral weathering and that a more detailed mechanistic understanding of these must be developed in order to predict responses to environmental changes and anthropogenic impact. {\textcopyright} 2010 The British Mycological Society.

In saprotrophic fungi the amylases activity is absent. Mycorrhizal saprotrophs have a high pectinase activity as compared with the Litter saprotrophs Community of fungi is one of the main functional and structural components of forest ecosystems.

AB  - Forest replacement by exotic plantations drive important changes at the level of the overstory, understory and forest floor. In the Atlantic Forest of northern Argentina, large areas have been replaced by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) monocultures. Plant and litter transformation, together with harvesting operations, change microclimatic conditions and edaphic properties. Management practices such as thinning promote the development of native understory vegetation and could counterbalance negative effects of forest replacement on soil. Here, the effects of pine plantations and thinning on physical, chemical and microbiological soil properties were assessed. Bacterial, archaeal, and fungal community structure were analyzed using a metabarcoding approach targeting ribosomal markers. Forest replacement and, to a lesser extent, thinning practices in the pine plantations induced significant changes in soil physico-chemical properties and associated shifts in bacterial and fungal communities. Most measured physical and chemical properties were altered due to forest replacement, but a few of these properties reached values similar to natural forests under the thinning operation. Fungal alpha diversity decreased in pine plantations, whereas bacterial alpha diversity tended to increase but with little statistical support. Shifts in community composition were observed for both fungal and bacterial domains, and were mostly related to changes in plant understory composition, soil carbon, organic matter, water content, pH and bulk density. Among several other changes, highly abundant phyla such as Proteobacteria (driven by many genera) and Mortierellomycota (mainly driven by Mortierella) decreased in relative abundance in the plantations, whereas Acidobacteria (mainly driven by Acidothermus and Candidatus Koribacter) and Basidiomycota (mainly driven by the ectomycorrhiza Russula) showed the opposite response. Taken together, these results provide insights into the effects of forest replacement on belowground properties and elucidate the potentially beneficial effect of thinning practices in intensive plantation systems through promoting the understory development. Although thinning did not entirely counterbalance the effects of forest replacement on physical, chemical and biological soil properties, the strategy helped mitigating the effects and might promote resilience of these properties by the end of the rotation cycle, if subsequent management practices compatible with the development of a native understory vegetation are applied. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020 Trentini, Campanello, Villagra, Ferreras and Hartmann.

AB  - Fruiting bodies of fungi belonging to more than 70 species were collected within a few thousand square meter area of one forest during 2006 and 2007. The soil profile was collected to check the cumulative deposition of Cs-137, which was relatively high, equal to 64 +/- 2 kBq/m(2) (calculated for October 2006). The majority of this activity was in the first 6 cm. Fruitbodies were analyzed for radiocesium and K-40 by means of gamma-spectrometry. The highest Cs-137 activity was 54.1 +/- 0.7 kBq/kg (dry weight) for a sample of Lactarius helvus collected in 2006. The results for 2006 were higher than those for 2007. In a few cases the traces of short-lived (T-1/2 = 2.06 a) Cs-134 were still found in samples. The importance of mycorrhizal fungi for radiocesium accumulation is confirmed. The differences in activity among the species are discussed in relation to observations and predictions from previous studies, where the change in relative accumulation between fruiting bodies of different species was at least partially explained by the differences in the depth of the mycelium localization in a litter/soil system. It is concluded that in some cases, such as Boletus edulis and Xerocomus badius, this prediction is fulfilled and therefore this explanation confirmed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Experimental evidence from a diverse set of forested ecosystems indicates that CO2 enrichment may lead to deeper rooting distributions. While the causes of greater root production at deeper soil depths under elevated CO2 concentration ([CO2]) require further investigation, altered rooting distributions are expected to affect important ecosystem processes. The depth at which fine roots are produced may influence root chemistry, physiological function, and mycorrhizal infection, leading to altered nitrogen (N) uptake rates and slower turnover. Also, soil processes such as microbial decomposition are slowed at depth in the soil, potentially affecting the rate at which root detritus becomes incorporated into soil organic matter. Deeper rooting distributions under elevated [CO2] provide exciting opportunities to use novel sensors and chemical analyses throughout the soil profile to track the effects of root proliferation on carbon (C) and N cycling. Models do not currently incorporate information on root turnover and C and N cycling at depth in the soil, and modification is necessary to accurately represent processes associated with altered rooting depth distributions. Progress in understanding and modeling the interface between deeper rooting distributions under elevated [CO2] and soil C and N cycling will be critical in projecting the sustainability of forest responses to rising atmospheric [CO2]. {\textcopyright} The Authors (2010).

AB  - Tropical forests have high rates of soil carbon cycling, but little information is available on how roots, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and free-living microorganisms interact and influence organic matter mineralization in these ecosystems. We used mesh ingrowth cores and isotopic tracers in phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers to investigate the effects of roots and AMF mycelia on (1) microbial community composition, microbial carbon utilization, and hydrolytic enzyme activities for large, potted tropical trees and (2) enzyme activities and litter mass loss in a lowland tropical forest. Under the tropical tree, plant-derived carbon was incorporated predominantly into bacterial groups in both rhizosphere and AMF-only soils. Gram-positive bacteria incorporated additional soil-derived carbon in rhizosphere soils, which also contained the highest microbial biomass. For hydrolytic enzymes, $\beta$-glucosidase and N-acetyl $\beta$-glucosaminidase activities were highest in rhizosphere soils, while phosphomonoesterase activity was highest in AMF-only soil. In the forest, leaf litter mass loss was increased by the presence of roots, but not by the presence of AMF mycelia only. Root-microbial interactions influenced organic matter cycling, with evidence for rhizosphere priming and accelerated leaf litter decomposition in the presence of roots. Although AMF mycelia alone did not stimulate organic matter mineralization, they were a conduit of carbon to other soil microorganisms. {\textcopyright} 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB  - In this paper, we report the influence of pine, oak and spruce forest litter on the growth and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) formation of Scots pine seedlings after the first growing season in a bare-root forest nursery. The mixture of collected forest litters and humus were used to obtain a 20-cm mulching layer on the prepared seedbeds. The concentrations of all nutrients and the C/N ratio of growth media were significantly higher in forest litter treatments than in negative control represented by mineral soil without litter. Addition of each forest litter type significantly enhanced pine seedling height and root-collar diameter compared to negative control. A significant positive influence on dry mass of stem, needles, roots and total dry mass of the seedling has been found only for pine litter. Based on molecular identification, seven ECM fungal taxa (Wilcoxina mikolae, Suillus luteus, Cenococcum geophilum, Meliniomyces bicolor, Laccaria laccata, unidentified Atheliaceae, unidentified Ascomycetes) were distinguished in the observed mycorrhizal communities. Each forest litter type significantly increased the total number of mycorrhizal tips and ECM fungal diversity compared to the control soil. However, results showed a lack of significant differences in species composition and relative abundance of ECM fungi between different litter types. Such result suggests that forest litter has not been a key source of inoculum for tested fungal species, as root systems of all pine seedlings from different litter types were dominated by a few nurseryadapted ECM fungi, probably originating from natural air-borne inoculum. Our data rather indicate that forest litter considerably improves environmental conditions for development of ECM fungi previously present in the nursery soil. Therefore, any of the forest litter types used in our studies may be able to promote planting stock quality on a small scale in the nursery phase. {\textcopyright} SISEF.

AB  - Experiments with plant species that can host both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are important to separating the roles of fungal type and plant species and understanding the influence of the types of symbioses on plant growth and nutrient acquisition. We examined the effects of mycorrhizal fungal type on the growth and tissue nutrient content of two tree species (Eucalyptus grandis and Quercus costaricensis) grown under four nutrient treatments (combinations of low versus high nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) with different N:P ratios) in the greenhouse. Trees were inoculated with unidentified field mixtures of AMF or EMF species cultivated on root fragments of AMF- or EMF-specific bait plants. In E. grandis, inoculation with both AMF and EMF positively affected belowground plant dry weight and negatively affected aboveground dry weight, while only inoculation with AMF increased tissue nutrient content. Conversely, Q. costaricensis dry weight and nutrient content did not differ significantly among inoculation treatments, potentially due to its dependence on cotyledon reserves for growth. Mineral nutrition of both tree species differed with the ratio of N to P applied while growth did not. Our results demonstrate that both tree species' characteristics and the soil nutrient environment can affect how AMF and EMF interact with their host plants. This research highlights the importance of mycorrhizal fungal-tree-soil interactions during early seedling growth and suggests that differences between AMF and EMF associations may be crucial to understanding forest ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Turnover of fungal biomass in forest litter and soil represents an important process in the environment. To date, knowledge of mycelial decomposition has been derived primarily from short-term studies, and the guild of mycelium decomposers has been poorly defined. Here, we followed the fate of the fruiting bodies of an ectomycorrhizal fungus in litter and soil of a temperate forest over 21 wk. The community of associated microbes and enzymatic processes in this specific substrate were described. The decomposition of fungal fruiting bodies exhibited biphasic kinetics. The rapid initial phase, which included the disappearance of DNA, was followed by a slower turnover of the recalcitrant fraction. Compared with the surrounding litter and soil, the mycelium represented a hotspot of activity of several biopolymer-degrading enzymes and high bacterial biomass. Specific communities of bacteria and fungi were associated with decomposing mycelium. These communities differed between the initial and late phases of decomposition. The bacterial community associated with decomposing mycelia typically contained the genera Pedobacter, Pseudomonas, Variovorax, Chitinophaga, Ewingella and Stenotrophomonas, whereas the fungi were mostly nonbasidiomycetous r-strategists of the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, Mortierella, Cladosporium and several others. Decomposing ectomycorrhizal fungal mycelium exhibits high rates of decomposition and represents a specific habitat supporting a specific microbial community. {\textcopyright} 2016 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is a process during which reactive N (including NH4 + and NO3 -) is deposited by the atmosphere into the soil and oceans. Over the last several decades, anthropogenic activities such as intensive agriculture and industry have caused a great increase in atmospheric N deposition. For example, the average N deposition rate in China has increased from 13.2 kg/hm2 in the 1980s to 21.1 kg/hm2 in the 2000s, and is projected to increase further in coming decades. Elevated N deposition will have many effects on forest ecosystems. Previous studies have shown that long-term N deposition will reduce plant diversity, inhibit the litter decomposition rate, change the soil microbial community structure, accelerate forest nitrogen saturation, cause soil acidification, and even alter the nutrient cycle. In recent years, the effects of atmospheric N deposition on the soil Phosphorus (P) cycle in forest ecosystems have received much attention, because P is one of the macronutrients essential to living organisms and is also the main limiting factor in most ecosystems. Although a series of studies were conducted that investigated the effect of N deposition on the soil P cycle in forest ecosystems, a general knowledge base has not yet been established. To rectify this, we used data from existing studies to summarize how N deposition affects the soil P cycle in forest ecosystems. The following aspects were described: 1) the concept of the soil P cycle in the context of forest ecosystems and 2) common methods used to study the effects of atmospheric N deposition on the forest soil P cycle, including long-term simulated N deposition, gradiated natural N deposition, and isotope tracing. In addition, 3) the results of previous studies on the effect of atmospheric N deposition on the forest soil P cycle were summarized. In general, atmospheric N deposition has a negative effect on the soil P cycle in forest ecosystems, in that it accelerates it. Three conclusions can be drawn about the effects of N deposition on three major soil P processes. I) Concerning the effect of N deposition on the P input in soil: litter production and the return of P from litter to soil generally depends on the initial soil N status. In "N-rich" soil, extra N input decreases litter production and inhibits the decomposition process, thus decreasing the rate of P return, whereas in "N-limited" soil, N input promotes these processes. II) Concerning the effect of N deposition on the internal transformation of soil P: long-term N deposition tends to weaken the mobility of P and decrease labile phosphate content. Microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP), an important source of labile soil phosphate in forests, also decreases under N deposition. III) Concerning the effect of N deposition on P output in the soil: when plant growth is limited by N, N deposition will stimulate plant uptake of P, and therefore increase the leaf P concentration while decreasing the leaf N/P ratio; however, when plant growth is not limited by N, N deposition will decrease plant uptake of P and thus the leaf P concentration, increase the leaf N/P ratio. Thus, we identified the major mechanisms driving changes in soil P cycling induced by N deposition. First, N deposition will directly alter the quality of the soil organic matter, such as the C: N: P ratio. High C/P and N/P ratios inhibit the decomposition process and the return of P to the soil. Second, N deposition alters microbial communities. Fungi, especially mycorrhizal fungi, are more sensitive to N deposition than bacteria. Third, N deposition alters soil P cycling by increasing the concentrations of base cations such as Fe3+, Al3+, and Mn2+, which bond with HPO4 2- and H2PO4 -. Finally, enzymes are also affected by N deposition. In N-saturated and P-limited soil, microbes and plant fine roots release phosphatase in order to accelerate the mineralization of organic phosphorus, which alleviate the soil P limitation. However, this increased phosphatase activity cannot not alter the low concentration of available P in the soil, because the mineralized available P will be taken up instantly by soil microbes and plant fine roots. Finally, we point out the limitations and problems with current studies, and suggest potential future avenues of research on the effects of N deposition on the forest soil P cycle. {\textcopyright} 2016, Ecological Society of China.

AB  - Windstorm is one of the destructive natural disturbances, but the scale-link extent to which recurrent windstorms influenced forests ecosystems is poorly understood in a changing climate across regions. We reviewed the synergistic impacts of windstorms on forests and assessed research trends and methodological approaches from peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 to 2020 in tropical (TRF), subtropical (SUF), and temperate (TEF) forests/zones, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Overall, the majority of the reviewed studies were conducted in TRF (i.e., 40%), intermediate in SUF (i.e., 34%), and the lowest in TEF (i.e., 26%). Among the four levels of biological organization, the species-population and community-ecosystem levels had the highest number of study cases, while the molecular-cellular-individual and landscape levels had the lowest study cases in all forest types. Most of the articles reviewed dealt largely on tree mortality/survival and regeneration/succession for TRF, tree mortality/survival and species composition/richness/diversity for SUF, and stem density, gap dynamics, and regeneration/succession for TEF. However, research on the effects of windstorms on mycorrhizal symbioses, population genetics, and physiological adaptation, element fluxes via litterfall, litter decomposition, belowground processes, biological invasion, and tree health are less common in all forest types. Further, most of the studies were conducted in permanent plots but these studies mostly used observational design, while controlled studies are obviously limited. Consequently, more observational and controlled studies are needed on the topic reviewed, particularly studies at the molecular-cellular-individual and landscape levels, to help inform forest management decision-making about developing sustainable and resilient forests amid climate change. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The identity of the dominant root-associated microbial symbionts in a forest determines the ability of trees to access limiting nutrients from atmospheric or soil pools1,2, sequester carbon3,4 and withstand the effects of climate change5,6. Characterizing the global distribution of these symbioses and identifying the factors that control this distribution are thus integral to understanding the present and future functioning of forest ecosystems. Here we generate a spatially explicit global map of the symbiotic status of forests, using a database of over 1.1 million forest inventory plots that collectively contain over 28,000 tree species. Our analyses indicate that climate variables—in particular, climatically controlled variation in the rate of decomposition—are the primary drivers of the global distribution of major symbioses. We estimate that ectomycorrhizal trees, which represent only 2% of all plant species7, constitute approximately 60% of tree stems on Earth. Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis dominates forests in which seasonally cold and dry climates inhibit decomposition, and is the predominant form of symbiosis at high latitudes and elevation. By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees dominate in aseasonal, warm tropical forests, and occur with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate biomes in which seasonally warm-and-wet climates enhance decomposition. Continental transitions between forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal trees occur relatively abruptly along climate-driven decomposition gradients; these transitions are probably caused by positive feedback effects between plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic nitrogen fixers—which are insensitive to climatic controls on decomposition (compared with mycorrhizal fungi)—are most abundant in arid biomes with alkaline soils and high maximum temperatures. The climatically driven global symbiosis gradient that we document provides a spatially explicit quantitative understanding of microbial symbioses at the global scale, and demonstrates the critical role of microbial mutualisms in shaping the distribution of plant species. {\textcopyright} 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - We investigated the feeding preferences of six species of mites and collembolans for three fungi commonly associated with roots of Acer saccharum (Glomus macrocarpum, Alternaria alternata and Trichoderma harzianum), from a maple-forest soil in southern Ontario, Canada. Experiments were also conducted in vitro to determine animal feeding responses to (1) increasing quantities of hyphal biomass, (2) the presence of root vs. litter fungal substrates, and (3) hyphae of different widths of Glomus macrocarpum. The results indicate that arthropods prefer to graze in the litter region rather than in the deeper soil layers. Under ideal moisture/temperature conditions, animals are forced to the lower regions by interspecific interactions. They prefer to graze on hyphae of conidial fungi rather than on those of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. When arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae are grazed, there is a clear preference for the narrower hyphae, which are those further away from the root. The thicker hyphal segments, commonly found connecting `'absorptive hyphal fans'' to roots, were less preferred. These data are not consistent with the hypothesis that microarthropods are detrimental to arbuscular mycorrhizal associations, and suggest that Glomalean fungi may have evolved mechanisms to deter grazing by microarthropods.

AB  - Rhizosphere soils receive a substantial input of plant carbon (rhizosphere C flux, RCF), and therefore support larger microbial populations and higher decomposing activity compared to bulk soils. The relative difference between rhizosphere and bulk soils (rhizosphere effect) may be sensitive to the effects of soil nutrient availability on plant belowground C allocation and RCF. However, it is not known whether rhizosphere effects are similarly responsive to availability of different nutrients, such as N or P, or to a combination of N and P. We tested the effects of elevated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), alone and in combination, on microbial activity and abundance in bulk and rhizosphere soils associated with two tree species, red maple and yellow birch, in young, possibly N-limited northern hardwood forests in a long-term fertilization study in New Hampshire, USA. We found that N addition increased microbial respiration, soluble inorganic N, and potential net N mineralization and nitrification, and decreased fungal abundance and fungal:bacterial ratios in red maple soils, but decreased microbial respiration, fungal abundance and the F:B ratio in yellow birch soils. Positive rhizosphere effects were observed for microbial respiration, potential net N mineralization, and microbial abundance for both tree species. Nitrogen addition suppressed rhizosphere effects on microbial activity and abundance in red maple soils but did not alter rhizosphere effects in yellow birch soils. Our results show strong effects of N and some interactions with P on soil processes, microbial abundance and rhizosphere effects in these forests. Nitrogen effects strongly depended on tree species, suggesting the importance of differential responses to nutrients between arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal associations, and indicating the importance of belowground processes to species-specific effects on C and mineral nutrient transformations. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We studied fine roots and ectomycorrhizas in relation to aboveground tree and stand characteristics in five mixed Betula pendula Roth, Picea abies (L.) H. Karst., and Pinus sylvestris L. stands in Southern Finland. The stands formed gradients of developmental stage (15-, 30-, and 50-year-old stands) in the stands of medium fertility, and of site fertility in the young stands (30-year-old fertile, medium fertile, and least fertile stands). The biomass of the external hyphae of ectomycorrhizas (ECM) was the highest, and the diversity of the fungal community the lowest, in the most fertile stand. The vertical distributions of fine roots of the three tree species were mostly overlapping, indicating high inter-specific belowground competition in the stands. We did not find any clear trends in the fine root biomass (FRB) or length across the stand developmental stages. The FRB of the conifers varied with site fertility, whereas in B. pendula it was almost constant. In contrast to the conifers, the specific root length (SRL) of B. pendula clearly increased from the most fertile to the least fertile stand. This indicates differences in the primary nutrient acquisition strategy between conifers and B. pendula. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.

AB  - Boreal forest soils store significant amounts of carbon and are cohabited by saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM). The 'Gadgil effect' implies antagonistic interactions between saprotrophic fungi and ECM. Plant photosynthates support the competitive fitness of the ECM, and may also shape the soil bacterial communities. Many 'Gadgil effect' experiments have focused on litter layer (OL) or have litter and root-fragments present, and thus possibly favor the saprotrophs. We compared how the restriction of plant roots and exudates affect soil microbial community structures in organic soil (mixed OF and OH). For this, we established a 3-yr field experiment with 3 different mesh treatments affecting the penetration of plant roots and external fungal hyphae. Exclusion of plant photosynthates induced modest changes in both fungal and bacterial community structures, but not to potential functionality of the microbial community. The microbial community was resilient towards rather short-term disturbances. Contrary to the 'Gadgil effect', mesh treatments restricting the entrance of plant roots and external fungal hyphae did not favor saprotrophs that originally inhabited the soil. Thus, we propose that different substrate preferences (fresh litter vs. fermented or humified soil), rather than antagonism, maintain the spatial separation of saprotrophs and mycorrhizal fungi in boreal forest soils. {\textcopyright} 2019 FEMS.

AB  - Adaptive management is a key component of a forest project being implemented across all of Weyerhaeuser' s coastal forest tenures. This project uses two main tools to accomplish the British Columbia (BC) Coastal Group's ecological and socio-economic goals: variable retention (VR) harvesting and broad zoning of the land base. The adaptive management program was designed to examine the effectiveness of retention systems and zoning in maintaining those forest attributes necessary to sustain biological richness and essential ecosystem functions, such as nutrient transfer, energy flow, decomposition, and dispersal of seeds, spores, and animals. The program is grounded on three biological indicators evaluated in both operational and experimental contexts: 1) representation of habitat types in a relatively unmanaged state to ensure that little-known species are retained; 2) structure of stands and landscapes to ensure that key elements are present through time; and 3) indicator organisms to track whether retaining structures and patterns, while addressing representation, will maintain species and populations whose life needs are well understood. Representation of ecosystems in unmanaged conditions has been examined. Habitat structure is being assessed in VR blocks and in unmanaged blocks. Studies on several organisms (breeding birds, owls, gastropods, amphibians, bryophytes, lichen, squirrels, mycorrhizae, and carabid beetles) have been underway for various lengths of time. These studies collected baseline information to begin comparisons of the effectiveness of the various types of VR for maintaining biological richness. The current focus in the adaptive management program is refining the lists of specific elements to monitor and beginning to create tools to help extrapolate relationships and findings over large areas and long time frames, with the expectation of operational implementation in 2003. The first two years of pilot work are also being used to examine how the results will link to management practices to strengthen areas that most need improvement. This paper describes three indicators used in Weyerhaeuser's adaptive management program.

AB  - In different forest ecosystems, fine roots commonly proliferate into litter layers, especially into those with favorable conditions for root growth. Our aim is to provide a basis for better understanding the role and mechanism of action in litter decomposition by fine roots and the influence of litter decomposition on fine root growth. We reviewed the advances of recent studies, including how roots forage into litter, the factors influencing this foraging, and the influence and possible mechanisms of fine root growth on litter decomposition. We put forward a conceptual module that enhances understanding of the interaction between fine-root growth and litter decomposition. Litter quantity on the soil surface affects the foraging behavior of fine-roots and drives their growth dynamics. Litter quality can also affect fine-root growth. Fine-root growth enhancement or inhibition could be the result of a positive or negative balance between nutrient and polyphenols concentrations generated during the decomposition of litter with different properties. By proliferating in litter, fine roots potentially influence litter decomposition through priming effects, N uptake, and symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi. The priming effects of live fine-roots on litter decomposition are mainly manifested by root exudate C inputs, which can regulate decomposition of litter by controlling the activity and composition of the microbial community. Nitrogen availability is critically important to litter decomposition, and low N availability can increase decomposition as microbes use labile substrates to acquire N from recalcitrant organic matter. Fine-roots grow into a decomposed litter layer, which avoid the adverse effects of excess N on microorganisms by absorbing a large amount of inorganic N during litter mineralization. In addition, root symbiotic partners, i.e., mycorrhizal fungi, have an important impact on litter decomposition through the types of fungi and enzymes and organic acids secretion. Key scientific issues for future research include the mechanism of combined effect of fine root growth on litter decomposition in the context of global climate change, as well as the connection of the fine root branching structure and function of nutrient acquisition in the litter layer. {\textcopyright} 2016, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

AB  - Young pitch pine seedlings are frequently subjected to prescribed burns in the New Jersey pine barrens as part of the management to eliminate fuel load in these forests, thereby reducing the risk of wildfire. The burns are relatively cool and release nutrients without killing the vegetation. Not all nutrients mineralized are immediately available to the plants, however. To determine factors that may contribute to nutrient release and to link this to availability of nutrients to plants following a fire in the pine barrens, a greenhouse study was conducted. The experimental design was a 3 × 2 × 2 × 3 factorial with three types of litter, high and low watering regime, burned and unburned litter, and three sample dates. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (through a rubidium analog) uptake rates were measured using natural isotope or radioisotope root bioassays. Though in the short time the experiment ran, neither an overall burned litter nor a litter quality effect was seen, high watering made P less available and K more available. N and K were the most available immediately following application of treatments, whereas P was not available until after 6 weeks following treatment application. Net mineralization of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium occurred in burned litter, whereas net immobilization of N and P occurred in highly watered, unburned litter. Since watering and timing were most influential in making nutrients available to seedlings following application of treatments in this greenhouse study, these factors may also be important in making nutrients available to mature trees in the New Jersey pine barrens. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) deposition on forests decreases the decomposition of organic matter, and may therefore decrease N mineralization. However, a higher N supply also meets the N demands of soil microbes, which may increase N mineralization, especially if the trees reduce their carbon allocation to mycorrhizal fungi and other biotic N sinks in the rhizosphere. We report effects of high continuous N load and of termination of N load on stem wood volume, foliar and soil chemistry, gross N turnover, and soil microbial communities in a boreal Norway spruce forest in Sweden. Ammonium nitrate had been applied annually for 42 years at average rates of 34 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of N to the N1 plots, and for two decades at 73 and 108 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of N to N2 and N3 plots, respectively. Treatments N2 and N3 were terminated 19 and 17 years before the study, which enabled us to study the recovery from the previous high N load. Stem growth responded strongly to N additions and correlated to gross N mineralization and microbial community composition. Total stem volume measured in 2010 was 299, 483, 470, and 376 m(3) ha(-1), in NO (control), N1, N2, and N3 plots, respectively. In N-limited control plots with high soil C/N ratio and low soil and needle N concentrations, we observed lower gross N mineralization rate and lower recovery of non-immobilized tracer in the soil ammonium pool, which indicates a high microbial N immobilization capacity. Commonly, microbial biomarkers decline after N addition, which was also found here, whereas total abundance was highest in high N plots with thick mor-layer. Contrary to our expectation the fungi/bacteria ratio was not lower, because fungi and bacteria declined concurrently and to the same extent. As we expected, soils in N amended plots had higher relative amounts of gram-positive bacteria than in control plots. Termination of N additions caused a reduction in gross N mineralization and needle N. Lower N-15 abundance in needles compared with the mor-layer indicated a recovery of the function of ectomy-corrhizal symbiosis. We propose that the higher gross N mineralization rate in N-loaded forest is not caused by greater decomposition of organic matter, but a higher internal turnover of microbial N.

AB  - Glomalin is a soil proteinaceous substance produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Most of the information available concerning this protein has been collected in relation to its role in soil aggregation. In this study, we explored the distribution of glomalin across soil horizons, decomposition of glomalin, and relationship with soil C and N in an agricultural field, a native forest, and an afforested system. Glomalin was present in A, B, and C horizons in decreasing concentrations. Land-use type significantly affected glomalin concentrations (mg cm(-3)), with native forest soils having the highest concentrations of the three land-use types in both A and B horizons. In terms of glomalin stocks (Mg ha(-1)), calculated based on corrected horizon weights, the agricultural area was significantly lower than both afforested and native forest areas. As measured after a 413 day laboratory soil incubation, glomalin was least persistent in the A horizon of the afforested area.. In agricultural soils and native soils, ca. 50\% of glomalin was still remaining after this incubation, indicating that some glomalin may be in the slow or recalcitrant soil C fraction. Comparison of glomalin decomposition with CO2-C respired during incubation indicates that glomalin makes a large contribution to active soil organic C pools. Soil C and N were highly correlated with glomalin across all soils and within each land-use type, indicating that glomalin may be under similar controls as soil C. Our results show that glomalin may be useful as an indicator of land-use change effects on deciduous forest soils.

AB  - The N cycles for a red pine Pinus resinosa plantation and a mixed hardwood stand in central Massachusetts, both of which were found to have high 'resistance' to nutrient losses following disturbance, are presented. Both stands exhibit 1) slow rates of N cycling, 2) undetectable levels of nitrate and ammonia in lysimeter samples collected below the rooting zone, 3) small to negligible enrichment of N in throughfall compared with stemflow, and 4) no immobilization of N in decomposing leaf litter. All of these indicate a slow and tight N cycle and may also be indicative of 'resistant' systems. Four major sinks for N within disturbed plots (created by trenching around a 1 X 4 m soil block) are analysed; 1) denitrification, 2) leaching losses below the rooting zone and immobilization into 3) fine roots and 4) woody roots. In the hardwood stand these account for only 37 of 104 kg N ha-1 mineralized and 66 of 90 kg N ha-1 in the pines. An additional internal sink may be a delayed immobilization potential resulting from the lack of immobilization in decomposing leaf litter. This creates soil organic matter which may be used as a substrate for further immobilization when the removal of plant uptake increases N availability in soils. Additional immobilization may result from a switch from a decomposition system dominated by symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi to one dominated by free-living microbes.-Authors

AB  - We employed Detritus Input and Removal Experiment (DIRT) to examine the effects of carbon (C) input on soil microbial biomass and community composition in 19-year-old Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook) and Mytilaria laosensis forests in subtropical China. The treatments included:(1) reciprocal litter transplant; (2) litter removal; (3) no inputs (litter removal+ root trenching); and (4) control. Each treatment had four 2 m×2 m plots. From January to December 2012, we collected the top 5 cm soil layer samples monthly from C. lanceolata and M. laosensis plots. Chloroform fumigation-extraction was used to determine the soil microbial biomass C and nitrogen (N) contents. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to characterize the microbial community composition in soil samples collected in June 2012. Results suggested that the C input manipulations induced differences in soil microbial biomass and community composition were dependent on tree species. C input manipulations had no significant effects on soil microbial biomass C and N under M. laosensis. However, the concentrations of microbial biomass C and N seemed to increase under C. lanceolata. PLFA analysis showed that M. laosensis litter significantly increased the contents of bacterial PLFAs, fungal PLFAs and actinomycetes, and significantly enhanced the percent abundance of gram-negative bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi under C. lanceolata. Litter removal significantly increased the contents of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, actinomycetes and fungi by 22%, 29%, 44%, 25% and 52%, respectively, and also increased the fungi to bacteria ratio by 21% compared with the control in C. lanceolata soil. However, litter removal and root trenching did not change soil microbial community composition in C. lanceolata and M. laosensis soils. Seasonal patterns of microbial biomass C and N were different between C. lanceolata and M. laosensis plantations. Nutrient availability rather than soil temperature, moisture or fresh litter input, may determine seasonal fluctuation of soil microbial biomass in this study. Our results suggested that further studies are required to confirm the relative contribution of above- and belowground C inputs in different tree species plantations in subtropical China. {\textcopyright} 2016, Ecological Society of China.

AB  - The major constraints to nutrient uptake by vascular plants in mediterranean South Africa and Western Australia are: very infertile soils, relatively low temperatures when water availability is high, and hot, dry summers. These constraints are partly overcome through increased efficiency of uptake, tapping novel sources of nutrients, and prolonging water uptake. Absorptive area per unit "cost" may be enlarged directly through increased fineness of the root system and proliferation of long root hairs. This reaches its greatest development in the root clusters of the Proteaceae (proteoid roots), Restionaceae ("capillaroid" roots) and Cyperaceae (dauciform roots). Absorptive area is increased indirectly through fungal hyphae which extend from hairless rootlets into the soil. Two major groups can be recognised: general (VA mycorrhizas) and host-specific (ericoid, orchid and sheathing mycorrhizas). Mycorrhizas are the most widespread specialised modes of nutrition and are probably universal in such major taxa here as Podocarpus, Acacia, Fabaceae, Poaceae, Asteraceae, Rutaceae, terrestrial orchids, Ericales and Myrtaceae. General mycorrhizas are the least drought-adapted of mechanisms for maximising absorptive area. All have been implicated in enhancing P uptake through increasing access to inorganic P, solubilisation and shortening the diffusion path. However, selective uptake of other nutrients, especially N, by host-specific mycorrhizas may be equally important. Included under novel sources of nutrients are free N2 (utilised by N2-fixing nodules), small-animal prey (carnivorous leaves) and persistent leaf bases (aerial roots of Kingia australis). Both legume and non-legume N2-fixing species are well-represented in these two regions, with stands of individual species in southwestern Australia estimated to contribute 2-19 kg N/ha/yr to the ecosystem. Free nitrogen fixation requires additional nutrients, especially Mo and Co, but is enhanced following fires and by supplementary uptake mechanisms, especially VA mycorrhizas. Southwestern Australia is particularly rich in carnivorous species. Nitrogen, P, K and S are important nutrients absorbed, with digestion aided by enzymes provided by bacteria and the glands. Parasitic plants both tap novel sources of nutrients and capitalise on any efficient water and nutrient uptake mechanisms of the hosts. Root parasites are better represented than stem parasites in mediterranean South Africa and Western Australia. Phosphorus and K in particular are absorbed preferentially by the haustoria, but much remains to be known about their modes of operation. Maximum activity of all uptake mechanisms, except those attached to some deep-rooted plants, is restricted to winter-spring. Most new seasons's rootlets and specialised roots are confined to the uppermost 15 cm of soil, especially in or near the decomposing litter zone. Nutrient uptake is further enhanced by the tendency for the rootlets to cluster, trapping water by capillary action and prolonging nutrient release. As an early product of decomposition, N tends to be available as NH4 (rather than NO3) and it is absorbed preferentially by almost all specialised modes of nutrition. Microorganisms are required in the formation and/or functioning of all these structures, except haustoria. Uptake mechanisms which are optional to the plant reach their peak contribution to the root system at soil nutrient levels well below those required for greatest plant growth, when they may be absent altogether. It is only over the narrow range of nutrient availability, where shoot content of a nutrient is greater in the presence of the mechanism than in its absence (other factors remaining constant), that specialised modes can be termed nutrient-uptake "strategies." For all specialised modes of nutrition, the component genera are better represented in these two regions than in the surrounding more fertile, arid to subtropical regions of much greater area. Endemism of species with each mode exceeds that for the two floras overall (75%). This is taken as preliminary evidence that specialised modes of nutrition are best represented in nutrient-poor soils. While they serve to limit nutrient loss from the ecosystem, their proliferation is therefore not necessarily a response to increasing "leaks" in the system. A hierarchical scheme of the functional/structural relationships between the various mechanisms is presented, starting with the rootless, VA-mycorrhizal plant as the most primitive condition. Taxa with many of the specialised modes of nutrition at present in southwestern South Africa and Western Australia have been evident in the pollen record since the early Tertiary Period. The absence of ectomycorrhizal forests in mediterranean South Africa, in marked contrast to Western Australia, can be traced to differences in their paleohistory. In both regions, the combination of fluctuating, but essentially diminishing, nutrient and water availability that began with the first mediterranean climate < 5 million years ago resulted in decimation of the less-tolerant rainforest ancestors on the one hand, and remarkable rates of speciation of the pre-adapted sclerophyll nucleus on the other. {\textcopyright} 1982 The New York Botanical Garden.

AB  - Northern peatlands are important carbon (C) sinks and while the patterns of C accumulation have been frequently investigated, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) accumulation are often neglected. Here we link the C:N:P stoichiometry from foliar plant tissues, through senescent litters to peat, and determine C, N and P accumulation rates at Mer Bleue Bog, eastern Canada. Average C:N:P ratios changed from 794:17:1 in the foliar tissues to 911:10:1 in litter and 1285:32:1 in acrotelm peat. The increase in C:N and C:P ratios from mature to senescent tissues is related to nutrient resorption. The increase in C:P and N:P ratios in peat, which was contrary to that observed in Canadian forest soils, may be related to plant/mycorrhizae uptake of P. The long-term apparent rates of C, N and P accumulation were 29.5 ± 2.1 (SE) g C, 0.87 ± 0.01 g N and 0.017 ± 0.002 g P m-2 yr-1, respectively. The significant correlation between the accumulation rates of N and P and that of C suggests more attention be placed on C:N:P stoichiometry in peatland biogeochemistry, in particular in understanding why C:P ratios are so large in the lower parts of the profile. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A 2-yr study evaluated the effects of acid precipitation on the forest floor community. Throughfall was collected at weekly intervals, acidified to pH 4.3 and 3.6, and applied to throughfall excluded 1 m2 plots in a stand of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) in south Mississippi, and in a longleaf pine (P. palustris Mill.) plantation in east Texas. Control plots received ambient throughfall which ranged from pH 3.7 to 6.2 in Mississippi and pH 3.8 to 6.7 in Texas. Five plots of each treatment at each location were destructively sampled after 1 yr and the 5 remaining plots were sampled after 2 yr. Chemical analyses were conducted for all collections of throughfall and litter leachate, and for the fermentation layer, rhizosphere, and mineral soil. After 2 yr, comparisons of the pH 3.6 plots with the controls indicated significant decreases in the number, length and biomass of lateral roots, and the percent and number of ectomycorrhizae. Decreases in these root characteristics for plots subjected to applications of throughfall acidified to near-ambient pH 4.3 were also significant or bordered on significance. Numbers of herbivorous mites increased significantly with decreasing pH, but the predaceous mites appeared insensitive. Treated plots had fewer numbers of some groups of the larger invertebrates, especially earthworms, but variation was generally too great to show significance. The acid treatments had little effect on numbers of nematodes, saprophytic fungi or endomycorrhizal fungi. {\textcopyright} 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The frequent co-occurrence of ectomycorrhizas and arbuscular mycorrhizas in the same ecosystem raises the question about how two functionally different mycorrhizal associations exploit a spatially heterogeneous habitat. Horizontal (in plots along a transect of 3750 m crossing forest types of low and high abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) host species) and vertical (across profiles of litter and 0-5 cm, 10-15 cm, 25-35 cm soil layers) distribution of ectomycorrhizas and arbuscular mycorrhizas in relation to edaphic parameters (pH, moisture, total carbon, total nitrogen and extractable-phosphorus concentration) was compared in Korup National Park rain forest, to test the hypothesis that the two types of mycorrhiza exploit different niches. No pattern was observed in either ECM or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fractional colonization with depth in the profile even though most of the variation in soil parameters was vertical. Only local (between monoliths within plots) horizontal differences were found in soil parameters. By contrast, horizontal differences in fractional colonization were found between forest types, and between monoliths, for ectomycorrhizas but only between monoliths for arbuscular mycorrhizas. The lack of a clear relationship between both horizontal and vertical distribution of ECM and AM fractional colonization and soil parameters suggests that both fungal groups are equally able to colonize the same niche, at the scale of our experiment. By contrast, a negative relationship was found between AM and ECM fractional colonization in the litter and 0-5 cm and 10-15 cm soil layers. This, in addition to the more heterogeneous horizontal distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizas in forest areas dominated by ectomycorrhizas and a patchy vertical distribution of the former as opposed to a more coherent distribution of the latter, suggests that both types of mycorrhizal fungi compete for the same niche. The co-occurrence of ectomycorrhizas and arbuscular mycorrhizas might be explained by differences between ECM and AM hosts and fungi in their colonizing abilities.

AB  - A variety of mushrooms, plants and soils collected in Japanese forests were analyzed for 137Cs, 134Cs and 40K. The 137Cs concentrations in forest soils ranged from <0.6-175 Bq/kg on a dry weight basis. The highest 137Cs concentrations in the soil profiles were observed mostly in the surface soil layer (0-5 cm). Litter layers contained significantly less 137Cs than the surface soil layer. Concentrations of 137Cs in plants were in general much lower than those in mushrooms. The levels of 137Cs in 81 mushroom species collected in 1989 and 1990 varied very widely, ranging from <4 to 16300 Bq/kg (dry wt.), while those of 40K were relatively constant. The median concentrations of 137Cs and 40K were 45 and 1110 Bq/kg (dry wt.), respectively. The 137Cs concentrations in mycorrhizal fungi tended to be higher than those in saprophytes, although the concentration range of each type varied widely. High concentrations of 137Cs in several Hebeloma species, ammonia fungi, were observed. In addition to the species-specific accumulation, the concentrations in many mushrooms reflected the layers in which their mycelia were growing. {\textcopyright} 1993.

AB  - Heterotrophic soil microorganisms rely on carbon (C) allocated belowground in plant production, but belowground C allocation (BCA) by plants is a poorly quantified part of ecosystem C cycling, especially, in peat soil. We applied a C balance approach to quantify BCA in a mixed conifer-red maple (Acer rubrum) forest on deep peat soil. Direct measurements of CH4 and CO2 fluxes across the soil surface (soil respiration), production of fine and small plant roots, and aboveground litterfall were used to estimate respiration by roots, by mycorrhizae and by free-living soil microorganisms. Measurements occurred in two consecutive years. Soil respiration rates averaged 1.2 $\mu$mol m-2 s-1 for CO2 and 0.58 nmol m-2 s-1 for CH4 (371 to 403 g C m -2 year-1). Carbon in aboveground litter (144 g C m-2 year-1) was 84% greater than C in root production (78 g C m-2 year-1). Complementary in vitro assays located high rates of anaerobic microbial activity, including methanogenesis, in a dense layer of roots overlying the peat soil and in large-sized fragments within the peat matrix. Large-sized fragments were decomposing roots and aboveground leaf and twig litter, indicating that relatively fresh plant production supported most of the anaerobic microbial activity. Respiration by free-living soil microorganisms in deep peat accounted for, at most, 29 to 38 g C m -2 year-1. These data emphasize the close coupling between plant production, ecosystem-level C cycling and soil microbial ecology, which BCA can help reveal. {\textcopyright} Taylor and Francis Inc.

AB  - To understand how ectomycorrhizal (ECM), wood-decomposing (WDC) and litter-decomposing (LDC) fungi differ in abundance and fruiting season, fruiting-body production was monitored by counting their number and/or measuring their biomass in deciduous broad-leaved and coniferous forests in Ishikawa (central Japan) and Hokkaido (northern Japan). ECM fungi were dominant in forests of both types in Ishikawa and a Larix kaempheri forest in Tomakomai (Hokkaido), whereas WDC fungi were dominant in a deciduous broad-leaved forest in Sapporo (Hokkaido). ECM and WDC fungi usually showed two abundance peaks in Kanazawa (Ishikawa), mid-summer and autumn for ECM fungi and spring or summer and autumn for WDC fungi, whereas LDC fungi usually showed one peak in autumn. In Tomakomai, the abundance peak appeared later in ECM fungi but earlier in LDC and WDC fungi in comparison with Kanazawa. The mode of resource acquisition is assumed as one of factors that affect the seasonal timing of fruiting-body production. On the other hand, highly positive correlations were often observed between precipitation in Jun or Aug and the fruiting-body production in summer and/or autumn in the survey in Kanazawa, suggesting that precipitation could affect the fruiting-body production a few months later.

AB  - Soil has been proposed as a driver explaining the development of monodominant forests in the tropics, for example, Gilbertiodendron dewevrei forests (GDF) in central Africa. The aim of this study was to compare the physical and chemical properties of soils under GDF with those under an adjacent mixed forest (AMF), while controlling for topography. To this end, we set up sixteen 0.25-ha plots according to forest type and topography (plateau vs. bottomland), in the Yoko forest reserve, Democratic Republic of Congo. In each plot, we measured litter thickness and collected a total of 80 soil samples at depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 120-150 cm, for standard physical and chemical analyses. When controlling for topography and soil texture, we found that most of the chemical properties of soils under GDF did not differ from those of soils under AMF, particularly acidity, cation concentration, total N and the C:N ratio. The litter layer was 2.3 times thicker under GDF than under AMF stands, and, for a given texture, soils under GDF had a slightly higher organic C concentration in the 0-5 cm soil layer. This study suggests that G. dewevrei stands modify organic matter dynamics, which may be important in maintaining its monodominance. {\textcopyright} Copyright Cambridge University Press 2018.

AB  - Host-plants may rarely leave their ancestral niche and in which case they tend to be surrounded by phylogenetically distant neighbours. Phylogenetically isolated host-plants might share few mutualists with their neighbours and might suffer from a decrease in mutualist support. In addition host plants leaving their ancestral niche might face a deterioration of their abiotic and biotic environment and might hence need to invest more into mutualist partners. We tested whether phylogenetic isolation of hosts from neighbours decreases or increases abundance and activity of their mutualists and whether mutualist activity may help to compensate deterioration of the environment. We study oak-hosts and their ectomycorrhizal fungi mutualists established in the litter layer formed by the phylogenetically closely or distantly related neighbourhood. We find that oaks surrounded by phylogenetically distant neighbours show increased abundance and enzymatic activity of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the litter. Moreover, oaks surrounded by phylogenetically distant neighbours also show delayed budburst but ectomycorrhizal fungi activity partly compensates this negative effect of phylogenetic isolation. This suggests decreased nutrient availability in a phylogenetically distant litter partly compensated by increased litter-degradation by ectomycorrhizal fungi activity. Most observed effects of phylogenetic isolation cannot be explained by a change in baseline soil fertility (as reflected by nutritional status of fresh oak litter, or soil microbial biomass and activity) nor by simple reduction of percentages of oak neighbours, nor by the presence of gymnosperms. Our results show that colonizing new niche represented by the presence of distantly related neighbours may delay plant phenology but may be supported by mycorrhizal mutualists. Studies on other host-plant species are required to generalize our findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plant nutrient acquisition in forests requires respiration by roots and mycorrhizae. Belowground carbon allocation and soil respiration should thus reflect plant effort allocated to nutrient uptake, for example in conditions of different nutrient availabilities controlled by site quality or stand history. Soil respiration, belowground C allocation, and fine root biomass were measured in three sites differing in nutrient availability in the northern hardwood forests of the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Annual soil respiration and belowground C allocation measured in two stands at each site were lowest at Jeffers Brook, the site with highest nutrient availability, and higher at Hubbard Brook and Bartlett Experimental Forests. Neither soil respiration nor belowground C allocation differed significantly between mid-aged (31–41 year old) and older stands (>80 year old) within the sites, despite higher fine root (<1 mm) biomass in old stands than mid-aged stands. During the growing season, soil respiration was low where net nitrogen mineralization and net nitrification were high across an extensive sample of thirteen stands and annual belowground C allocation decreased with increasing nitrification across the six intensively studied stands. Available P was not related to soil respiration. The relationships among N availability, belowground C allocation, and soil respiration support the claim that forests allocate more C belowground in ecosystems with low availability of a limiting nutrient. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal association is ubiquitous and can be found in majority of natural habitats. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play a key role in the absorption of plant nutrients, soil aggregation and fertility. The basic role of AMF in the plant growth is to increase the absorption and translocation of relatively immobile ions and elements. In the past, studies have focused primarily on the mycorrhiza development and their general role in the growth of plants. Here, in this review manuscript, we highlight the role of AMF in the growth of old forests. In many studies, it has been found that concentration of phosphorous (P) decreases with the stand age which as a result leads to phosphorous (P) deficiency. This phosphorous (P) deficiency is considered as a cause of slow growth of old forests. In this review article, we argued that apart from the low concentration of phosphorous (P), weak arbuscular mycorrhizal associations are also a cause of slow growth of old forests. Furthermore, we also highlight the ecological role of AMF in the soil carbon storage. AMF provide physical (hyphae frame) and chemical support (Glomalin) to the dispersed soil particles to create stable aggregated soil structure. The Glomalin compound which is released by AMF acts like a glue and consequently increases soil aggregation. The soil organic matters stored in soil aggregates are less exposed to decomposition. Hence, soil can be used as a large sink where a huge amount of carbon can be stored in the form of soil organic matters which as a result can contribute to the mitigation of global climate change. {\textcopyright} 2019, AL{\"{O}}KI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Mycorrhizal and saprotrophic (SAP) fungi are essential to terrestrial element cycling due to their uptake of mineral nutrients and decomposition of detritus. Linking these ecological roles to specific fungi is necessary to improve our understanding of global nutrient cycling, fungal ecophysiology, and forest ecology. Using discriminant analyses of nitrogen ($\delta$15N) and carbon ($\delta$13C) isotope values from 813 fungi across 23 sites, we verified collector-based categorizations as either ectomycorrhizal (ECM) or SAP in > 91% of the fungi, and provided probabilistic assignments for an additional 27 fungi of unknown ecological role. As sites ranged from boreal tundra to tropical rainforest, we were able to show that fungal $\delta$13C (26 sites) and $\delta$15N (32 sites) values could be predicted by climate or latitude as previously shown in plant and soil analyses. Fungal $\delta$13C values are likely reflecting differences in C-source between ECM and SAP fungi, whereas 15N enrichment of ECM fungi relative to SAP fungi suggests that ECM fungi are consistently delivering 15N depleted N to host trees across a range of ecosystem types. {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.

AB  - A major gap in understanding the relationship between tree diversity and litter decomposition concerns knowledge of the saprotrophic fungal communities mediating decomposition processes. Making use of experimental tree diversity plots in subtropical China, our objective was to disentangle the effects of tree species richness on diversity, abundance, and composition of saprotrophic fungal communities in freshly fallen leaf litter. We employed a meta-genomic approach and analysed enzymatic decomposition. Our results indicate the dominance of Ascomycota, with species from this phylum colonizing leaf litter more rapidly than Basidiomycota. Furthermore, Ascomycota was the most abundant when tree richness was intermediate. Both Ascomycota and Basidiomycota differed significantly in their species composition in response to varying tree species richness. However, saprotrophic fungal species diversity did not respond to tree species richness. Instead, litter C/N ratio, litter Ca and plot altitude were the strongest determinants of fungal species diversity. Carbon-degradation enzyme activities were also significantly associated with litter C/N ratio, Ca and Fe concentration and, in addition, with tree species richness. The responses of fungal species and enzyme activity to tree species richness were uncoupled from each other, although the two variables were significantly correlated. Overall, our findings highlight a significant effect of tree species richness on litter fungal species composition, but not diversity. Our findings also provide insight into the importance of enzyme-mediated C degradation for the response to tree species richness in early-stage leaf decay in subtropical forests. {\textcopyright} 2018

AB  - Cutting dry deciduous forest (preserved site) for wood supply in semi-arid Brazil has led to invasion of a pioneer shrub vegetation called “Carrasco” (disturbed site), which inhibits the sprouting of native species. A land restoration project was undertaken in a cleared Carrasco area where a mixed plantation of native species and Eucalyptus spp. (experimental site) was established to preserve the forest and ensure wood supply for the local population. We considered phosphorus as a limiting soil nutrient to plant growth, and we addressed the roles of litter decomposition and microbial activity on phosphorus release in the disturbed, preserved and experimental sites. The phosphorus released from leaf litter was affected by the vegetation type, which favored specific soil microbial populations during decomposition. The Carrasco vegetation predominantly favored arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), as shown by root colonization in the litter bags; the Eucalyptus plants favored AMF and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EM), as well as phosphate solubilizing microorganisms (PSM), and the intercropping system favored AMF and PSM groups. In contrast, the preserved site favored the PSM population. High phosphatase activity was found in the preserved and experimental sites in contrast to the Carrasco soil. Principal component analysis showed that AMF root colonization and phosphatase activity were the main parameters influencing the increase in soil phosphorus. Based on the above results, rehabilitation appeared to be underway in the experimental site, since the samples were more similar to the preserved site than to the disturbed site. This effect was attributed to Eucalyptus camaldulensis that promote the establishment of all phosphorus cycle-related microorganisms (AMF, EM and PSF). E. camaldulensis associated with mycorrhizal fungi and PSM are recommended for inclusion in agroforestry systems. {\textcopyright} SISEF.

AB  - Anthropogenic fires have varying effects on the oak-dominated forests of the Zagros Mountains in western Iran. The objective of this project was to investigate the effects of fire on various components of soil. For this purpose three homogeneous and neighboring sites were inspected. Site A was the unburned control. Sites B and C experienced fires about 2 and 8 years prior to the study, respectively. In comparison to the control, site B showed a decline in organic matter content (1.69 ± 0.24 vs. 1.13 ± 0.17), N amount (0.40 ± 0.05 vs. 0.19 ± 0.03), litter depth (1.20 ± 0.214 cm vs. 0.087 ± 0.044 cm), germinated seedlings (272 ± 40 vs. 75 ± 25), earthworm biomass (3.4 g/kg vs. 0.26 g/kg), and plant diversity (1.95 ± 0.30 vs. 1.35 ± 0.34). An increase was observed for pH (7.41 ± 0.11 vs. 7.72 ± 0.15), Ca (569.09 ± 34 vs. 855 ± 38.17), bulk density (1.17 ± 0.05 vs. 1.66 ± 0.18), the number of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) spores, and stump sprouting (1645 ± 533 and 3425 ± 491). Site C showed a similar decrease in organic matter content, N amount, litter depth, germinated seedlings, and earthworm biomass. However, plant diversity was greatly increased at site C, demonstrating that the conditions were better for plant life 8 years after the fire event. Thus, the number of germinated seedlings was lower than that of the control, while stump sprouting (4170 ± 452 per ha) was the greatest. The AM spore count was higher at site B in comparison to site C, indicating that fire had caused a long-term loss in this essential component of the soil. An increase in pH was a characteristic feature of the burnt sites. Levels of macronutrient K were greatly increased at site C. In fact, K content was much higher than the other two sites (A, B, and C: 51.81 ± 3.69, 59.75 ± 8.18, and 72.55 ± 20.66, respectively), indicating that increased K content is a long-term effect of fire. Bulk density (1.80 ± 0.14) increased at site C, which may be due to the insufficient earthworm biomass. Thus, 8 years were not enough to improve the soil conditions for soil fauna. {\textcopyright} T{\"{U}}BİTAK.

AB  - Fungi are an important and diverse component of soil communities, but these communities have proven difficult to study in conventional biotic surveys. We evaluated soil fungal diversity at two sites in a temperate forest using direct isolation of small-subunit and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA genes by PCR and high-throughput sequencing of cloned fragments. We identified 412 sequence types from 863 fungal ITS sequences, as well as 112 ITS sequences from other eukaryotic microorganisms. Equal proportions of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota sequences were present in both the ITS and small-subunit libraries, while members of other fungal phyla were recovered at much lower frequencies. Many sequences closely matched sequences from mycorrhizal, plant-pathogenic, and saprophytic fungi. Compositional differences were observed among samples from different soil depths, with mycorrhizal species predominating deeper in the soil profile and saprophytic species predominating in the litter layer. Richness was consistently lowest in the deepest soil horizon samples. Comparable levels of fungal richness have been observed following traditional specimen-based collecting and culturing surveys, but only after much more extensive sampling. The high rate at which new sequence types were recovered even after sampling 863 fungal ITS sequences and the dominance of fungi in our libraries relative to other eukaryotes suggest that the abundance and diversity of fungi in forest soils may be much higher than previously hypothesized.

AB  - Relationships between mycorrhizal plants and soil nitrogen (N) have led to the speculation that the chemistry of plant litter and the saprotrophy of mycorrhizal symbionts can function together to closely couple the N cycle between plants and soils. We hypothesized that a tannin-rich, ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) plant promotes the retention of protein-tannin N in soil, and that this N source is accessible to saprotrophic ERM symbionts and their hosts, but remains less available to co-occurring ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbionts and their hosts. 2. We tested this feedback hypothesis in a southern Appalachian forest community composed of two microsites: a hardwood microsite with ECM and AM trees in the overstorey and understorey, and an AM herb layer; and a rhododendron microsite where the understorey and herb layer are replaced by ERM rhododendron. We synthesized 15N-enriched protein-tannin complexes from leaf litter extracts representing each forest microsite and examined the fate of 15N in soil volumes 3 months and 1 year after the complexes were placed in the field. 3. Protein-tannin complexes derived from the rhododendron microsite led to a higher retention of 15N in soil organic matter and a lower recovery in dissolved N pools than those from the hardwood microsite, supporting the hypothesis that rhododendron tannins create stable complexes that increase organic N retention in soils. 4. Rhododendron complexes led to greater 15N-enrichment in ERM roots than in AM and ECM roots, supporting the hypothesis that rhododendron can better access the N complexed by its own litter tannins than can co-occurring forest trees and plants. Our results suggest that both fungal saprotrophy and a high specific root length contribute to the ability of ERM roots to acquire N from complex organic sources. 5. Synthesis. This study provides evidence of an intricate N feedback where plant litter chemistry influences the cycle of N to maximize N acquisition by the host's mycorrhizal roots, while hindering N acquisition by mycorrhizal roots of co-occurring plants. Feedback processes such as these have the potential to drive patterns in nitrogen cycling and productivity in many terrestrial ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2009 British Ecological Society.

AB  - Forest degradation is widespread in developing countries, as poor people depend on forest biomass collection on a “day-to-day” basis, giving little respite to forest ecosystems to recover. In the Himalayas, collection of firewood, tree leaf fodder, and leaf litter from forest floor is one of the main causes of forest degradation, particularly in oak (Quercus leucotrichophora) and pine (Pinus roxburghii) elevation belt (1000-2200 m elevation) of the Western and Central Himalayas. In this area, whole tree cutting is uncommon, but most trees are lopped until they become severely denuded, with little crown left. Compared to healthy forests, generally such degraded forests have 40-50% less biomass but about 80% less net primary productivity and 86.4% less leaf area. As degradation progresses, the biomass extracted from the forest declines, but in proportional terms it increases, resulting in a rapid disintegration of ecosystem structure and functions. Some of the observed effects are (1) reduction of soil carbon and nitrogen by 40-50%; (2) desiccation of oak acorns lying on forest floor well before the arrival of monsoon; (3) about 40% reduction in leaf litter decomposition; (4) 35% reduction in ectomycorrhizal association with roots, as indicated by fungal sporocarp density; and (5) 25% reduction in soil water holding capacity and 25% increase in soil bulk density (these values are in comparison to a relatively undisturbed forest). Recovery of a degraded forest (chronic disturbance) has not yet been investigatedbut is likely to be slower than that of a clear-cut (acute disturbance) forest. However, some interventions can result in a faster recovery. {\textcopyright} Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

AB  - Many forest soils are potassium (K) deficient, and Suillus species are common fungi in boreal pine forests that form ectomycorrhizal associations with trees. To select the ideal ectomycorrhizal fungi for improving the growth and K nutrition of trees in natural and artificial forests, the growth, oxalate efflux, K absorption and soil K depletion by 13 Suillus isolates were compared in pure liquid culture using soil as the sole K source. The growth of mycorrhizal Pinus massoniana Lamb. seedlings and the K extraction through extramatrical mycelia extending from the root surfaces were studied. The results showed that the tested Suillus species varied in growth rate and in the extraction of unavailable K from the soil. Their oxalate efflux may lead to the decomposition of K-bearing minerals and K release. The plants grown with added mycorrhizal fungi had higher biomass and extracted more K, particularly mineral structural K (HF-HClO4 digestible K), from the soil through the extramatrical mycelia than the seedlings grown without added mycorrhizal fungi. There was a positive correlation in K uptake between fungi grown in vitro and plants grown with mycorrhizae (R2 = 0.717, n = 8, p <.01). Therefore, in vivo tests on ectomycorrhizal fungal isolates can be used as a proxy to study the patterns and mechanisms of K extraction from the soil by extramatrical mycelia. Fungal K uptake in vitro could be one of the important indexes in the selection of Suillus for improving the growth and K nutrition of P. massoniana trees. Highlights: Suillus isolates varied in their ability to extract unavailable K from soil. Oxalate was vital to the degradation of K minerals in soil by Suillus isolates. Pine seedlings with added mycorrhizal fungi from genus Suillus had larger biomass and K uptake than their non-mycorrhizal counterparts. Suillus isolates showed similar patterns in K uptake in vitro and when forming mycorrhiza. {\textcopyright} 2019 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - Fungi are important members of soil microbial communities with a crucial role in biogeochemical processes. Although soil fungi are known to be highly diverse, little is known about factors influencing variations in their diversity and community structure among forests dominated by the same tree species but spread over different regions and under different managements. We analyzed the soil fungal diversity and community composition of managed and unmanaged European beech dominated forests located in three German regions, the Schw{\"{a}}bische Alb in Southwestern, the Hainich-D{\"{u}}n in Central and the Schorfheide Chorin in the Northeastern Germany, using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA pyrotag sequencing. Multiple sequence quality filtering followed by sequence data normalization revealed 1655 fungal operational taxonomic units. Further analysis based on 722 abundant fungal OTUs revealed the phylum Basidiomycota to be dominant (54%) and its community to comprise 71.4% of ectomycorrhizal taxa. Fungal community structure differed significantly (p≤0.001) among the three regions and was characterized by non-random fungal OTUs co-occurrence. Soil parameters, herbaceous understory vegetation, and litter cover affected fungal community structure. However, within each study region we found no difference in fungal community structure between management types. Our results also showed region specific significant correlation patterns between the dominant ectomycorrhizal fungal genera. This suggests that soil fungal communities are region-specific but nevertheless composed of functionally diverse and complementary taxa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wubet et al.

AB  - Fungal peroxidases (ClassII) have a key role in degrading recalcitrant polyphenolic compounds in boreal forest wood, litter and humus. To date, their occurrence and activity have mainly been studied in a small number of white-rot wood decomposers. However, peroxidase activity is commonly measured in boreal forest humus and mineral soils, in which ectomycorrhizal fungi predominate. Here, we used degenerate PCR primers to investigate whether peroxidase-encoding genes are present in the genomes of a wide phylogenetic range of ectomycorrhizal taxa. Cloning and sequencing of PCR products showed that ectomycorrhizal fungi from several different genera possess peroxidase genes. The new sequences represent four major homobasidiomycete lineages, but the majority is derived from Cortinarius, Russula and Lactarius. These genera are ecologically important, but consist mainly of non-culturable species from which little ecophysiological information is available. The amplified sequences contain conserved active sites, both for folding and substrate oxidation. In some Cortinarius spp., there is evidence for gene duplications during the evolution of the genus. ClassII peroxidases seem to be an ancient and a common feature of most homobasidiomycetes, including ectomycorrhizal fungi. Production of extracellular peroxidases may provide ectomycorrhizal fungi with access to nitrogen sequestered in complex polyphenolic sources.

AB  - Among saprotrophic macromycetes of forest litter only a few species show a significant increase or decrease, but most saprotrophic species of grass and heathlands are markedly decreasing, due to modern agricultural practice, notably use of artificial fertilizers. Lignicolous macromycetes are in general increasing, in particular parasitic species, an increase mainly ascribed to ageing of forests. Among ectomycorrhizal macromycetes not a single species showed a significant increase, but at least 55 out of 126 species showed a significant decrease, a decline strongest among species exclusively or mainly associated with coniferous trees. At least 15 ectomycorrhizal species seem to have disappeared completely from the Netherlands. The decrease of ectomycorrhizal fungi is mainly attributed to acid precipitation and its effects on soil chemistry and the vitality of trees. -from Author

AB  - Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) deposition can change above- and belowground biodiversity, including root-associated fungi that are tightly linked to plant fitness. We investigated the effect of eleven years of N and S addition on the diversity of root-associated fungal pathogens and mutualists, including ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), dark septate endophytes (DSEs), and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi (ERM), in a broadleaf tree-dominated boreal forest using HiSeq sequencing of ITS2 amplicons of root fungal DNA. Long-term N and S addition increased the diversity of root-associated pathogens, notably the abundance of Venturia macularis, which causes aspen leaf and shoot blight, in the forest floor. Nitrogen addition increased the abundance of several N-sensitive EMF taxa and of EMF related to organic-N uptake from the soil, but had little effect on the overall abundance and diversity of EMF. Nitrogen and S addition did not affect the abundance and diversity of DSEs, but N addition decreased the Shannon diversity and evenness of ERM communities in the mineral soil. The changed diversity of root-associated fungal pathogens and mutualists suggests that long-term N and S addition will impact the host plant's capacity for nutrient acquisition and defense against pathogens in the broadleaf-dominated boreal forest. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soils in boreal forests contain large stocks of carbon. Plants are the main source of this carbon through tissue residues and root exudates. A major part of the exudates are allocated to symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi. In return, the plant receives nutrients, in particular nitrogen from the mycorrhizal fungi. To capture the nitrogen, the fungi must at least partly disrupt the recalcitrant organic matter-protein complexes within which the nitrogen is embedded. This disruption process is poorly characterized. We used spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome profiling to examine the mechanism by which the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus degrades organic matter when acquiring nitrogen from plant litter. The fungus partially degraded polysaccharides and modified the structure of polyphenols. The observed chemical changes were consistent with a hydroxyl radical attack, involving Fenton chemistry similar to that of brown-rot fungi. The set of enzymes expressed by Pa.involutus during the degradation of the organic matter was similar to the set of enzymes involved in the oxidative degradation of wood by brown-rot fungi. However, Pa.involutus lacked transcripts encoding extracellular enzymes needed for metabolizing the released carbon. The saprotrophic activity has been reduced to a radical-based biodegradation system that can efficiently disrupt the organic matter-protein complexes and thereby mobilize the entrapped nutrients. We suggest that the released carbon then becomes available for further degradation and assimilation by commensal microbes, and that these activities have been lost in ectomycorrhizal fungi as an adaptation to symbiotic growth on host photosynthate. The interdependence of ectomycorrhizal symbionts and saprophytic microbes would provide a key link in the turnover of nutrients and carbon in forest ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Because of their prominent role in global bioproductivity and because of their complex structure and function, forests and tree species deserve particular attention in studies on the likely impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 on terrestrial vegetation. Besides a synoptic review of some of the most prominent above-ground response processes, particular attention is given to below-ground responses of trees to elevated atmospheric CO2, while some feedback processes and interactions with Various biotic and abiotic factors are also briefly summarized. At the leaf level there is little evidence of the long-term loss of sensitivity to CO2 that was suggested by earlier experiments with tree seedlings in pots. Future studies on photosynthesis measurements will probably not alter our conclusions about acclimation, but should focus more on respiration under elevated CO2, which is still poorly understood. At the tree level, the increase in growth observed in elevated CO2 results from an increase in both leaf area and leaf photosynthetic rate (per unit leaf area). Tree growth enhancement is generally larger at high rates of nutrient supply; when nutrient supply rates do not meet growth rates, tree nutrient status declines and nutrients become limiting. In many studies at the canopy level, a shift in whole-tree carbon allocation pattern towards below-ground parts has been associated with increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. At the ecosystem level, a larger amount of carbon being allocated below-ground could show up by either (1) more root growth and turnover, (2) enhanced activity of root-associated microorganisms, (3) larger microbial biomass pools and enhanced microbial activity, or (4) increased losses of soil carbon through soil respiration. Fine root production is generally enhanced, but it is not clear whether this response would persist in a forest. As elevated CO2 stimulates biomass production, litterfall and rhizodeposition also increase. This increased delivery of labile organic matter to the soil could influence soil microbial communities and subsequent decomposition rates, nutrient availability and carbon storage in soil. There are, however, contradictory hypothesis about the direction in which nutrient availability will be affected. Knowledge of the response of these and other ecophysiological processes to elevated CO2 is the key to understanding the functioning of the whole forest ecosystem. Our current knowledge is sufficiently large with regard to how the carbon uptake process and individual tree growth respond under atmospheric changes, but more emphasis should be put in future experiments on the interactions between various processes, such as the carbon and nitrogen cycles, and on below-ground responses.

AB  - According to the economy theory, plants should preferentially allocate photosynthate to acquire below-ground resources under elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) but decrease below-ground C allocation when nitrogen (N) is sufficient for plant growth. Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) represent a critical mechanism of below-ground nutrient acquisition for plants. The dynamics of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) could therefore reflect the response of plant C allocation under eCO(2) and N addition. We examined the responses of glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) to eCO(2) (approximately 700 mu mol mol(-1) CO2) and/or N addition (100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) as NH4NO3) in a modeled subtropical forest to better understand its potential influence on soil C storage. We hypothesized that GRSP would increase under eCO(2) and decrease under N addition. Furthermore, the positive effects of eCO(2) on GRSP would be offset by extra N addition, and GRSP would remain unchanged under combined eCO(2) and N addition. Our results showed that the mean concentrations of easily extractable GRSP (EE-GRSP) and total GRSP (T-GRSP) were 0.35 +/- 0.05 and 0.72 +/- 0.13 mg C cm(-3), respectively, which accounted for 2.76 +/- 0.53\% and 5.67 +/- 0.92\% of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the 0-10 cm soil layer. Elevated CO2 significantly increased T-GRSP by 35.02\% but decreased EE-GRSP by 5.09\% in the top 10 cm soil layer. The opposite responses of T-GRSP and EE-GRSP to eCO(2) might result from an unchanged photosynthate investment to AMF with possible changes in their decomposition rates. The effect of N on GRSP was contrary to our hypothesis, i.e., there was a 1.72\%-48.49\% increase in T-GRSP and a slightly increase in EE-GRSP. Both EE-GRSP and T-GRSP concentrations increased under the combination of eCO(2) and N addition, which was inconsistent with our hypothesis. The significant increase of EE-GRSP under the combination of eCO(2) and N addition was partly caused by more rapid plant growth and reduced microbial diversity, and the marginal increase of T-GRSP indicated that the interaction between eCO(2) and N addition offset their independent effects. In addition, the relatively higher accumulation ratios of GRSP (22.6 +/- 13.6\%) compared with SOC (15.9 +/- 9.4\%) indicated that more rapid GRSP deposition in the soil might accelerate SOC accumulation under eCO(2) and N addition. Our results will improve the understanding of the functioning of GRSP in soil C sequestration under global environmental change scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sudden aspen decline (SAD), present in many parts of North America, is the sudden dieback of branches, crown loss, and rapid mortality of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). We surveyed 21 plots in southwestern Colorado and categorized each plot by the mean percentage of recent crown loss (RCL) into three SAD levels: low SAD (0\%-25\% RCL), moderate SAD (25.1\%-50\% RCL), and high SAD (50.1\%-100\% RCL). Our research quantified the effects of SAD on microclimate and understory vegetation at the individual species and community level. Mean day surface, day subsurface, and night subsurface temperatures were warmer in high SAD stands than in low ones. High SAD stands had lower soil moisture, lower litter and duff depth, higher bare soil cover, higher photosynthetically active radiation, higher arbuscular mycorrhizal propagule densities, and higher grass biomass. Indicator plant species were uniquely associated with low and high SAD. Our study illustrates that SAD has multiple ecological effects on aspen understories, including a potential positive feedback in which warmer temperatures and decreased soil moisture, consequences of SAD, may lead to increased branch dieback and tree mortality, which would alter microclimate-making conditions more favorable to SAD and escalate the effects of SAD on understory vegetation.

AB  - There is growing interest in the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for ecological restoration. Numerous commercial AMF products are now available and are often used in preference to collecting indigenous AMF in treating restoration plants. Commercial AMF products are typically based on AMF strains exotic to the plant species and locations where they are used. We treated rooted cuttings of an endemic New Zealand tree species (Podocarpus cunninghamii) and an exotic and invasive grass (Agrostis capillaris) with an indigenous, pot-cultured AMF (Acaulospora laevis) and an exotic commercial AMF product (Glomus spp.). P. cunninghamii was grown in monoculture and together with A. capillaris, the latter to simulate field competition that often occurs in restoration plantings. In monoculture, the indigenous AMF resulted in significant increases in P. cunninghamii growth rates and tissue concentrations of both nitrogen and phosphorus. The commercial AMF had either no effect or a negative effect on P. cunninghamii growth and nutrient levels. A. capillaris growth and nutrient status were unaffected by the different AMF treatments. Competition eliminated any AMF benefit for P. cunninghamii. The results show that, for our chosen indigenous woody plant species, the commercially available AMF did not improve its early growth and nutrient acquisition in monoculture while, over the same period, the indigenous AMF induced positive growth and nutrient responses. These results have potential implications for forest restoration, particularly for nursery production of indigenous woody species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The effects of nitrogen (N) deposition on plant litter and soil organic matter decomposition differ depending on the stage of decomposition (early, late, and final stages). The effects can be divided further into direct and indirect ones. Direct effects: additions of ammonium and nitrate to fresh, newly shed litter stimulate the initial decomposition of celluloses and solubles. By contrast, addition of the same compounds to humus (final stages) clearly suppresses activity. This was seen in all studies reviewed and for several types of humus. Indirect effects: long-term deposition leads to increases in litter concentrations of N and other nutrients. This N in litter forms "natural" organic compounds and the resulting effects are similar to those resulting from natural variation among litter types. Thus, initial decomposition is generally higher for N (nutrient) rich plant litters than for litters with a lower N (nutrient) content In later stages, at which lignin-degradation rates regulate litter decomposition, N has a retarding effect on decomposition. Significant negative correlations have also been found between N concentrations in humus and respiration rate. There probably is a sink for deposited N in the humus. We may conclude that N storage in humus is regulated by a positive feedback mechanism. Raised levels of N resulting from N deposition cause more humus to be left in the system, and the resulting lower levels of Mn further retards humus decomposition, thus leading to an increased storage of N in humus. Thus, when calculating critical loads it would be incorrect to assume that N pools in the humus remain at a steady state.

AB  - Forest floor carbon stocks, which include different components of litter, hemic and sapric materials, have not been empirically quantified in tropical montane forest, although they influence soil carbon (C) pools. To date, the contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizae in C sequestration potentials in tropical montane forests have not been clearly investigated. This study determined the amount of C stocks in the different decomposing layers of forest floor, mainly litter, hemic and sapric materials. The abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal root colonisation differed among forest floor fractions. Forest floor was measured for depth, area density, dry mass and carbon fraction separately in Sungai Kial Forest Reserve, Pahang, Malaysia to calculate C stocks. Percentages of root colonisation in the hemic and sapric materials were investigated. The results showed that forest floor C stocks were significantly higher in hemic (5 Mg C ha−1) and sapric (7.7 Mg C ha−1) compared with the litter fragments (1.5 Mg C ha−1). Mycorrhizal root colonisation was significantly higher (75%) in the toeslope compared with the summit area in the hemic materials. Segregation of forest floor layers provided greater accuracy in forest floor C stocks reporting. {\textcopyright} 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - Deadwood is an important legacy structure in managed forests, providing continuity in shelter and resource availability for many organisms and acting as a vehicle by which nutrients can be passed from one stand to the next following a harvest. Despite existing at the interface between below- and above-ground systems, however, much remains unknown about the role woody debris plays in linking these zones. Moreover, it remains untested whether the accelerative effects of wood-feeding insects on wood decomposition influence tree growth or nutritional status in forests. In this study, we added different quantities of pine logs to the bases of saplings in two-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations in Mississippi, USA. We included a treatment in which subterranean termites (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae: Reticulitermes) were excluded from logs to determine how these insects affect the release of nutrients from wood and, in turn, tree growth. After 51 months of decomposition, we quantified below-ground effects by measuring microbial biomass, plant-available forms of N, and ectomycorrhizal diversity associated with fine tree roots. Meanwhile, above-ground measurements focused on the elemental concentrations in decomposing wood either protected or unprotected from termites and tree metrics related to growth and nutrient status. We found additions of wood to significantly increase nitrate and potential net nitrification relative to reference treatments but detected no significant effects on tree growth, needle nitrogen concentrations, or ectomycorrhizal diversity. Soil nitrate and potential net nitrification were higher under protected vs. unprotected logs, and plant-available forms of N were mostly more abundant short distances away from both protected and unprotected logs than directly under them. The wood of logs protected from termites had significantly lower concentrations of most elements compared to that of unprotected logs, largely due to the large amounts of soil imported into unprotected logs by termites. Termite exclusion had no measurable effect on tree growth, nutritional status, or ectomycorrhizal diversity, however. Our findings indicate that deadwood and termites both contribute to the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties but may have limited short-term local effects on tree growth. Longer-term studies and studies on less fertile sites are needed. {\textcopyright} 2017 Ulyshen et al.

AB  - Purpose: Forest recovery from disturbance can alter soil nitrogen (N) status as a result of complex interactions in plant-soil system. The $\delta$15N and $\delta$18O are indicators that integrate complex soil N processes and can help elucidate changes in soil N status. Our objectives were to evaluate differences in soil N status among different forest recovery stages in karst plateau in southwestern China. Methods: We established a forest recovery gradient with sites in cropland, abandoned cropland, shrub land, and early- and late-successional forests. We measured concentrations and isotopic compositions of soil total N, ammonium (NH4+), and nitrate (NO3−), and $\delta$15N of plant tissue. Results: With increased levels of recovery, concentrations of soil total N increased, and $\delta$15N of soil total N ($\delta$15NSTN) decreased at 0 $\sim$ 10 cm depth. A positive relationship between $\delta$15NSTN in surface soil and $\delta$15N of plant (P < 0.05) suggested that recovery of plant biomass was the main contributor to soil N recovery. A large difference between $\delta$15N of litter and $\delta$15NSTN demonstrated an important dependence of plants on mycorrhizal fungi for N acquisition. $\delta$15N of NH4+ was lower than $\delta$15NSTN, and a significant correlation between $\delta$15N and $\delta$18O of NO3− was observed only in late-successional forest (slope = l.4), indicating that gas N emission had a minor contribution to N loss. Ratio of ammonium N to nitrate N was < 1 (except in cropland), suggesting low risk of leaching. Conclusions: Forest recovery promoted soil N recovery, and reduced soil N loss in karst plateau. However, N limitation persisted throughout forest recovery stages. {\textcopyright} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Soil and litter fungi can colonise and decompose many natural materials, including highly resilient proteinaceous compounds of animal origin. The shells of terrestrial gastropods are formed from such a compound (conchiolin) combined with inorganic calcium carbonate. In this study, we investigated fungal communities colonising empty shells of the common terrestrial gastropod Cepaea hortensis. Shells were exposed on the surface of litter from four different forest types (alder alluvial, oak-hornbeam, peat-bog pine and scree forest) and the fungi were surveyed and identified in four 3-month periods. We found 27 fungal species, one fungus forming mycelial cords, seven types of sterile mycelium and streptomycetes colonising the shells. The most frequent fungal species identified were common soil fungi. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant effect of the litter type on the fungal community. Humidity and pH at the locality are likely to be more important for fungal communities than the proteinaceous material of the shell. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are important sinks for rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2. In previous research, we showed that net primary production (NPP) increased by 23 ± 2% when four experimental forests were grown under atmospheric concentrations of CO2 predicted for the latter half of this century. Because nitrogen (N) availability commonly limits forest productivity, some combination of increased N uptake from the soil and more efficient use of the N already assimilated by trees is necessary to sustain the high rates of forest NPP under free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE). In this study, experimental evidence demonstrates that the uptake of N increased under elevated CO2 at the Rhinelander, Duke, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory FACE sites, yet fertilization studies at the Duke and Oak Ridge National Laboratory FACE sites showed that tree growth and forest NPP were strongly limited by N availability. By contrast, nitrogen-use efficiency increased under elevated CO2 at the POP-EUROFACE site, where fertilization studies showed that N was not limiting to tree growth. Some combination of increasing fine root production, increased rates of soil organic matter decomposition, and increased allocation of carbon (C) to mycorrhizal fungi is likely to account for greater N uptake under elevated CO2. Regardless of the specific mechanism, this analysis shows that the larger quantities of C entering the below-ground system under elevated CO2 result in greater N uptake, even in N-limited ecosystems. Biogeochemical models must be reformulated to allow C transfers below ground that result in additional N uptake under elevated CO2. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

AB  - The soil animal food web has become a focus of recent ecological research but trophic relationships still remain enigmatic for many taxa. Analysis of stable isotope ratios of N and C provides a powerful tool for disentangling food web structure. In this study, animals, roots, soil and litter material from a temperate deciduous forest were analysed. The combined measurement of $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C provided insights into the compartmentalization of the soil animal food web. Leaf litter feeders were separated from animals relying mainly on recent belowground carbon resources and from animals feeding on older carbon. The trophic pathway of leaf litter-feeding species appears to be a dead end, presumably because leaf litter feeders (mainly diplopods and oribatid mites) are unavailable to predators due to large size and/or strong sclerotization. Endogeic earthworms that rely on older carbon also appear to exist in predator-free space. The data suggest that the largest trophic compartment constitutes of ectomycorrhizal feeders and their predators. Additionally, there is a smaller trophic compartment consisting of predators likely feeding on enchytraeids and potentially nematodes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Only a small fraction of the carbon (C) allocated belowground by trees is retained by soils in long-lived, decay-resistant forms, yet because of the large magnitude of terrestrial primary productivity, even small changes in C allocation or retention can alter terrestrial C storage. The humid tropics exert a disproportionately large influence over terrestrial C storage, but C allocation and belowground retention in these ecosystems remain poorly quantified. Using mass balance and 13C isotope methods, we examined the effects of afforestation and fertilization, two land-use changes of large-scale importance, on belowground C cycling at a humid tropical site in Hawaii. Here we report that in unfertilized plots, 80% of the C allocated belowground by trees to roots and mycorrhizae was returned to the atmosphere within 1 year; 9% of the belowground C flux was retained in coarse roots and 11% was retained as new soil C. The gains in new soil C were offset entirely by losses of old soil C. Further, while fertilization early in stand development increased C storage in the litter layer and in coarse roots, it reduced by 22% the flux of C moving through roots and mycorrhizae into mineral soils. Because soil C formation rates related strongly to rhizosphere C flux, fertilization may reduce an already limited capacity of these forests to sequester decay-resistant soil C. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In an experiment with factorial design performed in a mature, mixed Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand in central Finland, we studied the effects of sod cutting (exposing the mineral soil simulating mechanical site preparation) and trenching the study plot (excluding root-mycorrhizal connections) on soil organisms, decomposition rate and pine seedling performance. During two growing seasons after sod cutting, the growth of pine seedlings was significantly enhanced compared to plots with the organic layer left intact. Some epiedaphic soil animals, such as ants, spiders and certain entomobryid collembolan, were more active (pitfall sampling) on sod-cut plots. By the end of the second growing season numbers of enchytraeids were greater in the exposed mineral soil than in the mineral soil under the forest floor. Trenching induced changes in microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) pattern and collembolan community structure with decreased numbers of collembolans and biomass of fungi in organic soil of uncut plots. In addition, N content of pine seedlings increased after trenching. Overall, the effects of trenching on the measured variables were similar in sod-cut and uncut plots. We conclude that the effects of mechanical site preparation on decomposers and decomposition processes can be explained partly by exclusion of mycorrhizal-root connections and partly by a decrease in unfavourable conditions created by the organic soil layer and ground vegetation.

AB  - By reducing soil organic matter and litter input, land-use changes are predicted to decrease total soil fungal diversity, but at functional levels this have been poorly studied. It is expected, though, that increasing disturbance decreases saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi biodiversity. This study aimed to determine the effects of land-use changes on the phylogenetic and functional diversity of soil fungi in the Southern Andes. We assessed the fungal communities of Andosol topsoil at 1 cm and 10 cm soil depth. The soil samples were obtained from a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance; specifically, plots were located within pristine forest, overstory-managed, and clearcut conditions. We used a cultivation-independent molecular barcoding approach to assess fungal diversity and identify 1,173 OTUs from which 401 were assigned to a functional guild. While we found higher phylogenetic richness in clear-cut conditions, these soils had higher relative abundances of plant pathogen fungi and lower relative abundances of saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi compared to the other treatments. The opposite pattern was found in pristine forest. Thus, fungal species richness itself does not seem to reflect ecosystem health. Interestingly though, the lower phylogenetic diversity found in pristine forest was compensated by a higher diversity of fungi involved in nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2017, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.

AB  - We analysed stable isotopes of N in a spruce forest under ambient rainfall (no further manipulation of the atmospheric input) and clean rain application (10 years of reduced inorganic N- and acid-constituent input). The objectives of the study were to assess whether or not the natural 15N abundance would function as an indicator for the N-status of our forest ecosystems. For this purpose, natural 15N abundance values were measured in needles, litter fall, roots, soil, bulk precipitation, throughfall and soil water of both plots. In the bulk precipitation and throughfall the $\delta$15N values of NO3-N were in the range reported by other studies (-16 to + 23‰). In both plots, the throughfall was greatly depleted of 15N compared to the bulk precipitation and this was attributed to nitrification in the canopy leaves, leading to $\delta$15N-depleted nitrate production in the leaves that leaches down the soil surface. Nitrate in seepage water showed a general increase in $\delta$15N values when it passes through the upper mineral soil (10 cm soil depth) and infiltrates into deeper mineral soil horizons (100 cm soil depth), similar to the $\delta$15N enrichment of total nitrogen in the mineral soil. We observed 15N depletion in both green needles and litter fall at the clean rain plot, compared to the N-saturated control plot. We assumed it to be due to increased mycorrhizal N-uptake under N limited, i.e. clean rain conditions which are indicated by relatively lower N concentrations of green needles. With respect to the vertical gradient of the 15N abundance in the forest floor, both plots differ from each other, showing an untypical peak of $\delta$15N depletion in the humus layer, which is more pronounced at the control plot. In contrast to the mineral soil where mineralisation is a dominant process for fractionation we attribute the $\delta$15N pattern in the forest floor to additional processes like litter input and immobilisation. We conclude that the $\delta$15 natural abundance analysis is helpful for interpreting the N-status of forest ecosystems but further research is needed especially with respect to the soil-root interface.

AB  - The relationships between colonization of fermentation horizon organic matter (FHOM) by an ectomycorrhizal fungus and the activities of enzymes involved in key processes of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) mobilization were investigated. FHOM was collected from a birch forest and placed in transparent observation chambers with (M) or without (NM) plants of Betula pendula Roth, the roots of which were infected by Paxillus involutus (Fr.) Fr. The fungus colonized the FHOM of the M chambers, and after different periods of occupation the activities of protease, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase and phosphomonoesterase were determined in colonized and uncolonized substrate. Activities of protease and polyphenol oxidase increased in organic matter that had been occupied for 28–50 d, and remained elevated in FHOM that had been occupied for 50–98 d. However, although activity of phosphomonoesterase increased in FHOM that had been colonized for 28–50 d, amounts in FHOM colonized for 50–98 d decreased to below that found in uncolonized material. No difference in peroxidase activity was detected between colonized and uncolonized organic matter. The results are discussed in relation to the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in nutrient cycling processes in temperate forest ecosystems. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - An intensive recollection of Ascomycetes was carried out within the best-known preserved Mexican tropical montane cloud forest patch dominated by Fagus grandifolia subsp. mexicana. This relict tree species has a fragmented and restricted distribution in the mountains of eastern Mexico. Other Mexican endemic Fagaceae species show dominance in this forest patch. Historically, records of Ascomycetes fungi in this type of forest are scarce. The present study found 170 specimens belonging to 61 species, of which 30 are new records for the state, while 10 species are cited for the first time in the country. Most of the recorded Ascomycetes species are intimately associated to Fagaceae tree species (Fagus and Quercus). From these, many are endophytes belonging to the Order Xylariales, while others grow on decaying wood, fallen branches, leaves and/or litter (possibly mycorrhizal). This interesting close relationship between fungi and Fagaceae trees must be studied and analyzed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2019 Magnolia Press

AB  - Mycorrhizal fungi have considerable effects on soil carbon (C) storage, as they control the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), by modifying the amount of soil nitrogen (N) available for free-living microbes. Through their access to organic N, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi compete with free-living soil microbes; this competition is thought to slow down SOM decomposition. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi cannot decompose SOM, and therefore must wait for N to first be processed by free-living microbes. It is unclear what form of N the ECM fungi and free-living microbes compete for, or which microbial groups compete for N with ECM fungi. To investigate this, we focused on the N transformation steps (i.e., the degradation of high-molecular-weight organic matter, mineralization, and nitrification) and the microbes driving each step. Simple comparisons between AM forests and ECM forests are not sufficient to assert that mycorrhizal types would determine the N transformation steps in soil, because soil physiochemistry, which strongly affects N transformation steps, differs between the forests. We used an aridity gradient with large differences in soil moisture, pH, and SOM quantity and quality, to distinguish the mycorrhizal and physicochemical effects on N transformation. Soil samples (0–10 cm depth) were collected from AM-symbiotic black locust forests under three aridity levels, and from ECM-symbiotic oak forests under two aridity levels. Soil physicochemical properties, extractable N dynamics and abundance, composition, and function of soil microbial communities were measured. In ECM forests, the ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotic abundance was low, whereas that of ECM fungi was high, resulting in lower nitrate N content than in AM forests. Since ECM forests did not have lower saprotrophic fungal abundance and prokaryotic decompositional activity than the AM forests, the hypothesis that ECM fungi could reduce SOM decay and ammonification by free-living microbes, might not hold in ECM forests. However, the limitation of ECM fungi on nitrate N production would result in a feedback that will accelerate plant dependence on these fungi, thereby raising soil C storage through an increase in the ECM biomass and plant C investment in soils. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - Due to the standing biomass and turnover of fungal biomass in forest topsoils, decomposition of fungal biomass represents an important process. Within plant litter, dead fungal biomass represents a unique substrate that is typically nitrogen (N)-rich and is assumed to be subject to rapid decomposition. However, our current knowledge of mycelial decomposition has been largely derived from short-term studies, often limited to a single mycelia type, and the guilds of microbial mycelium decomposers have not yet been described. Furthermore, nutrient content may vary largely in fungal mycelia, and the consequences of this variation are unknown. Here, we followed the decomposition of dead biomass of 12 ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic fungi of a temperate forest using mycobags incubated in litter for 3 and 9 weeks. Loss of substrate dry mass, microbial biomass content and community composition as well as the activity of extracellular enzymes reflecting microbial activity on this substrate were followed. Decomposition rates of fungal biomass were typically high (0.13–0.30 week−1), yet variable. The decomposition includes a rapid initial phase followed by a slower turnover of remaining biomass. The initial nitrogen content that ranged between 1.5% and 10% appeared to be the most important factor that affected colonization of dead mycelia and their decomposition. The relatively high content of N makes fungal mycelia an attractive resource in the N-poor habitat of plant litter. Decomposition of mycelia was performed by a guild of specialist decomposers that showed rather low abundance in surrounding litter and changed during decomposition. Bacteria were much more abundant on dead fungal biomass than in the surrounding litter and appeared to play an important role in decomposition. Fungi associated with dead mycelia were mainly represented by yeasts and moulds. Although the importance of fungal mycelia for the nutrient cycling in forests is not yet clear, the fact that they are turned over rapidly suggests that they may represent an important and dynamic pool of carbon and nitrogen. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The importance of the ground vegetation and soil microbial biomass as sinks for nitrogen following conventional (CH) and whole-tree (WH) harvesting in a Sitka spruce plantation in N. Wales (UK), were investigated. Lysimeters containing the organic horizons were established with the treatments brash, Agrostis capillaris (L.) and/or Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) seedlings in a limited factorial design. Following a period of 15 months, during which chemical analysis of the lysimeter leachates was carried out, the lysimeters were destructively sampled and the vegetation and soil microbial biomass nitrogen pools measured. The effect of the different treatments on the decomposition rate of the organic matter and the growth and nutrient status of the young Sitka spruce trees was also determined. A comparison of the nitrogen pools and the cumulative leachate results identified the grass as the major sink for nitrogen with uptake over a 15 month period equivalent to 2.6 g N m-2 at 50-75% cover. Uptake by the Sitka spruce was also significant with net uptake ranging from 0.6 g N m-2 when growing with the grass to 1.74 g N m-2 when planted within a pile of brash. The microbial biomass nitrogen pool was unchanged by the presence of the grass species but was significantly increased in the lysimeters containing brash and/or Sitka spruce (possibly owing to the presence of mycorrhizal fungi). The microbial N pool was greatest in the treatment containing the combination of the trees planted within the brash, with 3.49 (±0.52) g N m-2 as microbial biomass N compared with 1.99 (±0.24) g N m-2 in the control lysimeters containing neither brash nor trees. The growth of the Sitka spruce was highly variable within treatments, however, the mean biomass m-2 doubled if planted within the brash, and also resulted in elevated foliar concentrations of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. When in competition with the grass, tree biomass was halved, tree needles appeared chlorotic and phosphorus concentrations were halved. The management implications for harvesting intensity on upland sites are considered. {\textcopyright} 1991.

AB  - In this paper, results are based on two years study conducted on ectomycorrhizal activity under the trees of Rhododendron arboreum, Ectomycorrhizal activity has correlated to the soil volume, soil moisture, pH and NPK content. The ectomycorrhizal activity was maximum during rainy season. Correlation between organic layer (humus) and ectomycorrhizal activity was also observed. PH in the acidic range was observed to support maximum mycorrhizal activity in all soil layers (litter, humus and mineral soil) during rainy season and humus was much acidic which supports maximum ectomycorhizae. Nitrogen and potassium were higher in litter and humus layer however phosphorus was maximum in mineral soil. It was also found that mycorrhizal activity was higher in soil with low phosphate content i.e. Humus.

AB  - Microbial symbioses have evolved repeatedly across the tree of life, but the genetic changes underlying transitions to symbiosis are largely unknown, especially for eukaryotic microbial symbionts. We used the genus Amanita, an iconic group of mushroom-forming fungi engaged in ectomycorrhizal symbioses with plants, to identify both the origins and potential genetic changes maintaining the stability of this mutualism. A multi-gene phylogeny reveals one origin of the symbiosis within Amanita, with a single transition from saprotrophic decomposition of dead organic matter to biotrophic dependence on host plants for carbon. Associated with this transition are the losses of two cellulase genes, each of which plays a critical role in extracellular decomposition of organic matter. However a third gene, which acts at later stages in cellulose decomposition, is retained by many, but not all, ectomycorrhizal species. Experiments confirm that symbiotic Amanita species have lost the ability to grow on complex organic matter and have therefore lost the capacity to live in forest soils without carbon supplied by a host plant. Irreversible losses of decomposition pathways are likely to play key roles in the evolutionary stability of these ubiquitous mutualisms. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wolfe et al.

AB  - Decomposition of wood is an important component of global carbon cycling. Most wood decomposition models are based on tree characteristics and environmental conditions; however, they do not include community dynamics of fungi that are the major wood decomposers. We examined the factors explaining variation in sapwood decay in oak tree stumps two and five years after cutting. Wood moisture content was significantly correlated with sapwood decay in younger stumps, whereas ITS-based composition and species richness of the fungal community were the best predictors for mass loss in the older stumps. Co-occurrence analysis showed that, in freshly cut trees and in younger stumps, fungal communities were nonrandomly structured, whereas fungal communities in old stumps could not be separated from a randomly assembled community. These results indicate that the most important factors explaining variation in wood decay rates can change over time and that the strength of competitive interactions between fungi in decaying tree stumps may level off with increased wood decay. Our field analysis further suggests that ascomycetes may have a prominent role in wood decay, but their wood-degrading abilities need to be further tested under controlled conditions. The next challenging step will be to integrate fungal community assembly processes in wood decay models to improve carbon sequestration estimates of forests. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Questions remain as to which soil nutrients limit primary production in tropical forests. Phosphorus (P) has long been considered the primary limiting element in lowland forests, but recent evidence demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in response to nutrient addition, highlighting a need to understand and diagnose nutrient limitation across diverse forests. Fine-root characteristics including their abundance, functional traits, and mycorrhizal symbionts can be highly responsive to changes in soil nutrients and may help to diagnose nutrient limitation. Here, we document the response of fine roots to long-term nitrogen (N), P, and potassium (K) fertilization in a lowland forest in Panama. Because this experiment has demonstrated that N and K together limit tree growth and P limits fine litter production, we hypothesized that fine roots would also respond to nutrient addition. Specifically we hypothesized that N, P, and K addition would reduce the biomass, diameter, tissue density, and mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots, and increase nutrient concentration in root tissue. Most morphological root traits responded to the single addition of K and the paired addition of N and P, with the greatest response to all three nutrients combined. The addition of N, P, and K together reduced fine-root biomass, length, and tissue density, and increased specific root length, whereas root diameter remained unchanged. Nitrogen addition did not alter root N concentration, but P and K addition increased root P and K concentration, respectively. Mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots declined with N, increased with P, and was unresponsive to K addition. Although plant species composition remains unchanged after 14 years of fertilization, fine-root characteristics responded to N, P, and K addition, providing some of the strongest stand-level responses in this experiment. Multiple soil nutrients regulate fine-root abundance, morphological and chemical traits, and their association with mycorrhizal fungi in a species-rich lowland tropical forest.

AB  - The ectomycorrhizal fungus Hysterangium setchellii (Fisher) forms extensive hyphal mats at the soillitter interface with the roots of the host tree Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii [(Mirb.) Franco]. Microbial biomass, and lignin and cellulose decomposition rates were measured seasonally for 1 year, using 14C techniques in ectomycorrhizal mat soils and adjacent non-mat soils in a second-growth Douglas fir forest. The microbial biomass and cellulose degradation rates were 3-6 times higher in ectomycorrhizal mat soils than in adjacent nonmat soils. Lignin degradation rates were higher in ectomycorrhizal mat soils than adjacent non-mat soils. Our data suggest that the ectomycorrhizal fungus H. setchellii provides a microenvironment with increased microbiological activity which results in faster lignin and cellulose decomposition. {\textcopyright} 1991 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Ecosystems often show differential sensitivity to chronic nitrogen (N) deposition; hence, a critical challenge is to improve our understanding of how and why site-specific factors mediate biogeochemical responses to N enrichment. We examined the extent to which N impacts on soil carbon (C) and N dynamics depend on microbial resource stoichiometry. We added N to forest plots dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees, which have litter and soil pools rich in organic N and relatively wide C:N ratios, and adjacent forest plots dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees, which have litter and soil pools rich in inorganic N and relatively narrow C:N ratios. While microbes in both plot types exhibited fairly strict biomass homeostasis, microbes in AM-and ECM-dominated plots differed in their physiological responses to N addition. Microbes in ECM plots responded to N enrichment by decreasing their investment in N-acquisition enzymes (relative to C-acquisition enzymes) and increasing N mineralization rates (relative to C mineralization rates), suggesting that N addition alleviated microbial N demand. In contrast, heterotrophic microbial activities in AM plots were unaffected by N addition, most likely as a result of N-induced increases in net nitrification (60% increase relative to control plots) and nitrate mobilization (e.g., sixfold increases in mobilization relative to control plots). Combined, our findings suggest the stoichiometric differences between AM and ECM soils are the primary drivers of the observed responses. Plant and microbial communities characterized by wide C:N are more susceptible to N-induced changes in decomposition and soil C dynamics, whereas communities characterized by narrow C:N are more susceptible to N-induced nitrate leaching losses. Hence, the biogeochemical consequences of N deposition in temperate forests may be driven by the stoichiometry of the dominant trees and their associated microbes. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - In soils under forest conditions and on seedlings grown under glasshouse conditions jarrah mycorrhizae exhibited strong habitat preferences. Litter on the forest floor was the main site for the formation of the white and brown ectomycorrhizae, and removal of the litter layer by prescribed burning reduced by 90% the numbers of these two ectomycorrhizae. Black ectornycorrhizae were dominant in the mineral horizons of soil and were unaffected by the type of surface litter. In glasshouse experiments litter from different plant species significantly influenced formation of ectomycorrhizae by jarrah seedlings. Litter from Acacia pulchella R. Br. was favourable for formation of ectomycorrhizae but ectornycorrhizae were absent from Banksia grandis Willd. litter. Black ectomycorrhizae, Hysterangium-initiated ectomycorrhizae and vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae formed on jarrah seedlings in the soils used in glasshouse studies. Addition of nitrogen and phosphorus to these soils influenced the relative abundance of mycorrhizae. It is postulated that inoculum levels, nutrient status of litter and soil and the presence of compounds inhibitory to fungal growth are critical in determining the abundance of mycorrhizae. Factors affecting formation of mycorrhizae by jarrah and the ecological implications of these results are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1984, CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiversity of the forest fungi of central India (Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and part of Maharashtra) has been recorded. A total of 838 fungi belonging to 321 genera (199 genera of ascomycetes, 107 basidiomycetes, 10 phycomycetes, and 3 myxomycetes) were recorded on different substrates from the forests. Among them, 529 species belong to ascomycete, 282 to basidiomycete, and 26 to lower fungi and myxomycete. The maximum number of fungi, 347 recorded on leaf, followed by 259 on stem and wood, 121 in soil/on ground, 33 in litter, 19 on roots, 24 on seed/pods/seedlings and 2 on insects, were reported on leaf causing common leaf diseases. Fungi recorded on stem, branches, twigs, culms, etc. are either causing cankers, twig blights, die back, etc. or decay and deterioration of these organs in standing trees as well as fallen parts on the forest floor. Top dying and root rot of teak caused by Phomopsis tectonae and Helicobasidium compactum are the diseases causing serious damage in plantations of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, respectively. Some fungi, for example species of Amanita, Astraeus, Boletus, Geastrum, Lepiota, Pisolithus, Ramaria, Russula, Scleroderma, Thelephora, etc., produce ectomycorrhizaewhile species of Coriolopsis, Daedalea, Daldinia, Earliella, Favolus, Flavodon, Funalia, Ganoderma, Hypoxylon, Hymenochaete, Inonotus, Irpex, Junghunia, Lenzites, Microporus, Navisporus, Phellinus, Polyporus, Polystictus, Poria, Pyrofomes, Rigidoporus, Skeletocutis, Stereum, Tremates, Xylaria, etc. are the common wood-decay fungi. Common mushroom collected from the ground and decaying wood and litter are species of Agaricus, Amanita, Agrocybe, Coprinus, Lepiota, Marasmius, Mycena, Pleurotus, Termitomyces, Tricholoma, and Volvariella. Root rot of Dalbergia sissoo and Acacia catechu caused by Ganoderma lucidum is posing a serious threat in central India. Spongipellis spumeus causes root rot in the mature trees of Albizia procera and is also causing considerable damage. Some recently recorded new diseases include vascular wilt of aonla caused by Fusarium solani and root rot of teak seedlings (only occurs under water stress condition) caused by Helicobasidium compactum and Tritirachium roseum. Two new genera and 30 new species were described from central India during the last 5 years. Recently described new species include Asterostomella shoreae, Cheilymenia jabalpurensis, Nitschkia tectonae, and Passalora emblicae. In central India over 2,700 fungi were collected during the last 15 years, out of them 12.3 % fungi were collected only once and are considered as threatened and needs conservation. Only 1.8 % fungi were frequently collected (more than 11 times during this period) including Phomopsis tectonae, whose population is recorded increasing in teak growing areas. The data indicate that the population of major fungi is dwindling with time. {\textcopyright} Springer India 2014 This work is subject. All rights reserved.

AB  - In boreal ecosystems plant production is often limited by low availability of nitrogen. Nitrogen retention in below-ground organic pools plays an important role in restricting recirculation to plants and thereby hampers forest production. Saprotrophic fungi are commonly assigned to different decomposer strategies, but how these relate to nitrogen cycling remains to be understood. Decomposition of Scots pine needle litter was studied in axenic microcosms with the ligninolytic litter decomposing basidiomycete Gymnopus androsaceus or the stress tolerant ascomycete Chalara longipes. Changes in chemical composition were followed by 13C CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy and nitrogen dynamics was assessed by the addition of a 15N tracer. Decomposition by C. longipes resulted in nitrogen retention in non-hydrolysable organic matter, enriched in aromatic and alkylic compounds, whereas the ligninolytic G. androsaceus was able to access this pool, counteracting nitrogen retention. Our observations suggest that differences in decomposing strategies between fungal species play an important role in regulating nitrogen retention and release during litter decomposition, implying that fungal community composition may impact nitrogen cycling at the ecosystem level. {\textcopyright} FEMS 2019.

AB  - A mycorrhiza is an association between soil fungus and a plant root and most vascular plants form mycorrhizal associations where the fungus benefits from photosynthetically derived carbon compounds. It has been known that mycorrhizas enhance uptake of mineral nutrients, particularly of phosphorus. Research has demonstrated that mycorrhizas also play an important role in the uptake of nutrients from organic materials. Ericoid mycorrhizas and some ectomycorrhizas (EM) species have the potential to degrade structural compounds of plant litter and mobilize nitrogen and phosphorus directly from organic polymers so that they are able to short circuit the microbial mineralization process. The role of mycorrhizas in the distribution of forest species is observed in New Zealand indigenous forests. All of the tree species that spread as wildings of any consequence in the country form ectomycorrhizas.

AB  - Rationale Data on the bulk stable isotope composition of soil bacteria and bacterivorous soil animals are required to estimate the nutrient and energy fluxes via bacterial channels within detrital food webs. We measured the isotopic composition of slime molds (Myxogastria, Amoebozoa), a group of soil protozoans forming macroscopic spore-bearing fruiting bodies. An analysis of largely bacterivorous slime molds can provide information on the bulk stable isotope composition of soil bacteria. Methods Fruiting bodies of slime molds were collected in a monsoon tropical forest of Cat Tien National Park, Vietnam, and analyzed by continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Prior to stable isotope analysis, carbonates were removed from a subset of samples by acidification. To estimate the trophic position of slime molds, their $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N values were compared with those of plant debris, soil, microbial destructors (litter-decomposing, humus-decomposing, and ectomycorrhizal fungi) and members of higher trophic levels (oribatid mites, termites, predatory macroinvertebrates). Results Eight species of slime molds represented by at least three independent samples were 3-6‰ enriched in 13C and 15N relative to plant litter. A small but significant difference in the $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N values suggests that different species of myxomycetes can differ in feeding behavior. The slime molds were enriched in 15N compared with litter-decomposing fungi, and depleted in 15N compared with mycorrhizal or humus-decomposing fungi. Slime mold sporocarps and plasmodia largely overlapped with oribatid mites in the isotopic bi-plot, but were depleted in 15N compared with predatory invertebrates and humiphagous termites. Conclusions A comparison with reference groups of soil organisms suggests strong trophic links of slime molds to saprotrophic microorganisms which decompose plant litter, but not to humus-decomposing microorganisms or to mycorrhizal fungi. Under the assumption that slime molds are primarily feeding on bacteria, the isotopic similarity of slime molds and mycophagous soil animals indicates that saprotrophic soil bacteria and fungi are similar in bulk isotopic composition.

AB  - Global changes such as atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition can alter the structure of microbial communities, but a mechanistic understanding of the linkages between community structure and ecosystem function is lacking. Here we apply a trait-based framework to an analysis of litter fungal communities in a temperate forest exposed to >20 years simulated N addition in order to develop hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying community responses and resulting changes in ecosystem function. We performed metabarcoding of the total and active fungal communities and measured extracellular enzyme activity in leaf litter after it decomposed for approximately two years in a long-term simulated N deposition experiment. We found that N fertilization decreased the relative abundance of six species in the active community that were highly correlated with lignin decomposing enzyme activity. Four of these species have currently unknown taxonomic identity and should be targets for isolation and further characterization. Nitrogen fertilization also increased species richness and relative abundance of yeasts in the total community and decreased their relative activity levels, suggesting these species may be dormant or otherwise inactive. Together these responses may contribute to accumulation of organic matter in soils by favoring yeasts that are not strong enzyme producers and by disfavoring the fungal species that are most active in litter decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important component of plant-soil systems. Its essential role in soil solution chemistry, soil-forming processes and its effects on biota, including soil fauna, bacteria, fungi and plants, is extensively documented in literature. In this contribution several forest leaf litter types are compared as sources of DOM and the released organics are subjected to gel permeation chromatography to reveal their molecular-size distribution. Moreover, complexing properties, as an indication for the podzolization potential of the litter leachates, were established. The occurrence and properties of DOM in different soil horizons were monitored beneath a stand of Scots pine. The effects of the different groups of soluble organics including phenolic, fulvic and humic acids, and of water-extractable humic substances on the performance of herbaceous plants of the forest floor are briefly reviewed. {\textcopyright} 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - 15N and 13C natural abundances of foliage, branches, trunks, litter, soil, fungal sporophores, mycorrhizas and mycelium were determined in two forest stands, a natural forest and a Norway spruce plantation, to obtain some insights into the role of the functional diversity of saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi in carbon and nitrogen cycles. Almost all saprotrophic fungi sporophores were enriched in 13C relative to their substrate. In contrast, they exhibited no or very little shift of $\delta$15N. Judging from the amount of C discrimination, ectomycorrhizal fungi seem to acquire carbon from their host or from dead organic matter. Some ectomycorrhizal species seem able to acquire nitrogen from dead organic matter and could be able to transfer it to their host without nitrogen fractionation, while others supply their host with 15N- depleted nitrogen. Moreover ectomycorrhizal species displayed a significant N fractionation during sporophore differentiation, while saprotrophic fungi did not. {\textcopyright} INRA, EDP Sciences, 2007.

AB  - Saprotrophic fungi are the primary decomposers of plant litter in temperate forests, and their activity is critical for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Simulated atmospheric N deposition is associated with reduced fungal biomass, shifts in fungal community structure, slowed litter decay, and soil C accumulation. Although rarely studied, N deposition may also result in novel selective pressures on fungi, affecting evolutionary trajectories. To directly test if long-term N enrichment reshapes fungal responses to N, we isolated decomposer fungi from a long-term (28 yr) N-addition experiment and used a common garden approach to compare growth rates and decay abilities of isolates from control and N-amended plots. Both growth and decay were significantly altered by long-term exposure to N enrichment. Changes in growth rates were idiosyncratic, as different species grew either more quickly or more slowly after exposure to N, but litter decay by N isolates was consistent and generally lower compared to control isolates of the same species, a response not readily reversed when N isolates were grown in control (low N) environments. Changes in fungal responses accompany and perhaps drive previously observed N-induced shifts in fungal diversity, community composition, and litter decay dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Studies of larger fungal fruit bodies were conducted in 15-year-old experimental plantations of Norway spruce and Scots pine in Sweden. After clear felling the logging waste was left on some plot but not on others. No significant differences were found between the two treatments with respect to biomass and number of fruit bodies of larger fungi, ratio between mycorrhizal fungi and litter decomposing fungi, and number and biomass of fruit bodies of many of the most common mycorrhizal fungi. The diversity index was significantly higher for plots with logging waste than for plots without. Fruit bodies of Dermocybe semisanguinea (Fr.) W{\"{u}}nsche were more abundant on plots without logging waste. Lower levels of fruit body biomass were found in places with abundant Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn. The estimated production of fungal fruit bodies varied between 0.1 and 16.6 and that of edible fruit bodies between 0.02 and 2.7 kg dry matter ha-1 yr-1. {\textcopyright} 1980.

AB  - Boreal forest soils store a major proportion of the global terrestrial carbon (C) and below-ground inputs contribute as much as above-ground plant litter to the total C stored in the soil. A better understanding of the dynamics and drivers of root-associated fungal communities is essential to predict long-term soil C storage and climate feedbacks in northern ecosystems. We used 454-pyrosequencing to identify fungal communities across fine-scaled soil profiles in a 5000 yr fire-driven boreal forest chronosequence, with the aim of pinpointing shifts in fungal community composition that may underlie variation in below-ground C sequestration. In early successional-stage forests, higher abundance of cord-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi (such as Cortinarius and Suillus species) was linked to rapid turnover of mycelial biomass and necromass, efficient nitrogen (N) mobilization and low C sequestration. In late successional-stage forests, cord formers declined, while ericoid mycorrhizal ascomycetes continued to dominate, potentially facilitating long-term humus build-up through production of melanized hyphae that resist decomposition. Our results suggest that cord-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi play opposing roles in below-ground C storage. We postulate that, by affecting turnover and decomposition of fungal tissues, mycorrhizal fungal identity and growth form are critical determinants of C and N sequestration in boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors New Phytologist {\textcopyright} 2014 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - Saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) forest fungi decompose organic matter and mobilize nutrients for host plants, respectively. Competition between the two guilds may cause the so-called Gadgil effect, i.e., decreased litter decomposition rates resulting in increased carbon storage in soil. The Gadgil effect was supposed to even affect global climate, highlighting the necessity to understand fungal distribution and interactions in soil. Searching for evidence of competition between saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi, we analyzed the distribution of fungi along a well-stratified vertical spruce forest soil profile in two seasons, i.e., autumn and the following spring. The different soil strata (i.e., two mineral horizons and two organic layers) underneath the litter layer were colonized by distinct fungal communities, which included roughly consistent proportions of all fungal guilds and phyla at each time. However, the community composition changed quantitatively between the sampling dates. Along the vertical soil profile, it differed mostly between the organic layers and the mineral soil, which is supposed to be due to differences in the predominant energy sources (i.e., aboveground litter and rhizodeposition, respectively). Network analyses revealed co-occurrences (i.e., positive correlations of individual abundances) to outweigh mutual exclusions (i.e., negative correlations) between individual fungi in each soil stratum and season. This also applied for interactions between saprotrophic and EcM fungi. Network analyses therefore provided no indications for a possible Gadgil effect. However, considering individual nutrient use efficiencies might refine insights from network analyses in future studies and facilitate linking community dynamics to ecosystem processes. {\textcopyright} 2018, German Mycological Society and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biological fertilization in energy forestry includes, in its widest sense, both (a) soil amendments with various forms of organic matter, e.g. farmyard manure, sewage sludge, wastewater, contaminated ground water, and green manure (including leguminous pre-crops, plant litter and harvest residues), (b) direct cultivation of symbiotically nitrogen-fixing woody plants or willow/poplar plantations intermixed with nitrogen-fixing ley crops or trees; and (c) stimulation or introduction of other rhizosphere microorganisms that interact positively with the energy forest crop with respect to plant nutrient uptake (e.g. mycorrhiza). Certain microbial aspects on the use of organic matter and the role of root-symbionts and other plant growth stimulating rhizosphere microorganisms are dealt with. The main emphasis, however, is laid on experiences of direct cultivation of woody leguminous and actinorhizal plants for energy forest purposes under both temperate and tropical conditions. Plant selection, plantation management, rhizobiology, climatic considerations and environmental aspects are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1994.

AB  - Despite the major importance of soil biota in nutrient and energy fluxes, interactions in soil food webs are poorly understood. Here we provide an overview of recent advances in uncovering the trophic structure of soil food webs using natural variations in stable isotope ratios. We discuss approaches of application, normalization and interpretation of stable isotope ratios along with methodological pitfalls. Analysis of published data from temperate forest ecosystems is used to outline emerging concepts and perspectives in soil food web research. In contrast to aboveground and aquatic food webs, trophic fractionation at the basal level of detrital food webs is large for carbon and small for nitrogen stable isotopes. Virtually all soil animals are enriched in 13 C as compared to plant litter. This ‘detrital shift' likely reflects preferential uptake of 13 C-enriched microbial biomass and underlines the importance of microorganisms, in contrast to dead plant material, as a major food resource for the soil animal community. Soil organic matter is enriched in 15 N and 13 C relative to leaf litter. Decomposers inhabiting mineral soil layers therefore might be enriched in 15 N resulting in overlap in isotope ratios between soil-dwelling detritivores and litter-dwelling predators. By contrast, 13 C content varies little between detritivores in upper litter and in mineral soil, suggesting that they rely on similar basal resources, i.e. little decomposed organic matter. Comparing vertical isotope gradients in animals and in basal resources can be a valuable tool to assess trophic interactions and dynamics of organic matter in soil. As indicated by stable isotope composition, direct feeding on living plant material as well as on mycorrhizal fungi is likely rare among soil invertebrates. Plant carbon is taken up predominantly by saprotrophic microorganisms and channelled to higher trophic levels of the soil food web. However, feeding on photoautotrophic microorganisms and non-vascular plants may play an important role in fuelling soil food webs. The trophic niche of most high-rank animal taxa spans at least two trophic levels, implying the use of a wide range of resources. Therefore, to identify trophic species and links in food webs, low-rank taxonomic identification is required. Despite overlap in feeding strategies, stable isotope composition of the high-rank taxonomic groups reflects differences in trophic level and in the use of basal resources. Different taxonomic groups of predators and decomposers are likely linked to different pools of organic matter in soil, suggesting different functional roles and indicating that trophic niches in soil animal communities are phylogenetically structured. During last two decades studies using stable isotope analysis have elucidated the trophic structure of soil communities, clarified basal food resources of the soil food web and revealed links between above- and belowground ecosystem compartments. Extending the use of stable isotope analysis to a wider range of soil-dwelling organisms, including microfauna, and a larger array of ecosystems provides the perspective of a comprehensive understanding of the structure and functioning of soil food webs. {\textcopyright} 2018 Cambridge Philosophical Society

AB  - Background and Aims Temperate deciduous forest understoreys are experiencing widespread changes in community composition, concurrent with increases in rates of nitrogen supply. These shifts in plant abundance may be driven by interspecific differences in nutrient foraging (i.e. conservative vs. acquisitive strategies) and, thus, adaptation to contemporary nutrient loading conditions. This study sought to determine if interspecific differences in nutrient foraging could help explain patterns of shrub success and decline in eastern North American forests. Methods Using plants grown in a common garden, fine root traits associated with nutrient foraging were measured for six shrub species. Traits included the mean and skewness of the root diameter distribution, specific root length (SRL), C:N ratio, root tissue density, arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization and foraging precision. Aboveand below-ground productivity were also determined for the same plants, and population growth rates were estimated using data from a long-Term study of community dynamics. Root traits were compared among species and associations among root traits, measures of productivity and rates of population growth were evaluated. Key Results Species fell into groups having thick or thin root forms, which correspond to conservative vs. acquisitive nutrient foraging strategies. Interspecific variation in root morphology and tissue construction correlated with measures of productivity and rates of cover expansion. Of the four species with acquisitive traits, three were introduced species that have become invasive in recent decades, and the fourth was a weedy native. In contrast, the two species with conservative traits were historically dominant shrubs that have declined in abundance in eastern North American forests. Conclusions In forest understoreys of eastern North America, elevated nutrient availability may impose a filter on species success in addition to above-ground processes such as herbivory and overstorey canopy conditions. Shrubs that have root traits associated with rapid uptake of soil nutrients may be more likely to increase in abundance, while species without such traits may be less likely to keep pace with more productive species. {\textcopyright} The Author 2017.

AB  - Ants are one of the most studied insects in the world; and the literature devoted to their origin and evolution, systematics, ecology, or interactions with plants, fungi and other organisms is prolific. However, no consensus yet exists on the age estimate of the first Formicidae or on the origin of their eusociality. We review the fossil and biogeographical record of all known Cretaceous ants. We discuss the possible origin of the Formicidae with emphasis on the most primitive subfamily Sphecomyrminae according to its distribution and the Early Cretaceous palaeogeography. And we review the evidence of true castes and eusociality of the early ants regarding their morphological features and their manner of preservation in amber. The mid-Cretaceous amber forest from south-western France where some of the oldest known ants lived, corresponded to a moist tropical forest close to the shore with a dominance of gymnosperm trees but where angiosperms (flowering plants) were already diversified. This palaeoenvironmental reconstruction supports an initial radiation of ants in forest ground litter coincident with the rise of angiosperms, as recently proposed as an ecological explanation for their origin and successful evolution. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The ectomycorrhizal mycelium is a large component of boreal and temperate forest soil microbial biomass and the resulting necromass is likely to be an important source of nutrients for saprotrophic microorganisms. Here we test the effects of species richness of ectomycorrhizal mycelial biomass on short-term CO2 efflux by amending forest soil with necromass from 8 fungal species added separately and in mixtures of 2, 4 and 8 species. All additions of necromass rapidly increased soil CO2 efflux compared to unamended controls but CO2 efflux increased significantly with species richness. Efflux of CO2 did not correlate with the carbon (C) or nitrogen (N) contents or the C:N ratio of the added necromass. The study demonstrates that species diversity of dead ectomycorrhizal fungal hyphae can have important consequences for soil CO2 efflux, and suggests decomposition of hyphae is regulated by specific constituents of the nutrient pools in the necromass rather than the total quantities added.

AB  - Introduction This chapter reviews the distribution, mechanism and impact of mineral tunnelling by soil ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF). Most trees in boreal forests live in close relation with EMF (Smith & Read, 1997). These EMF mediate nutrient uptake; they form an extension of the tree roots. In turn they obtain carbohydrates from the tree. Over the years ectomycorrhizal (EM) research has a strong focus on nutrient acquisition by EMF from organic sources (Read, 1991). In boreal forest systems, however, minerals could also be an important nutrient source, especially for calcium, potassium and phosphorus (Likens et al., 1994, 1998; Blum et al., 2002). Recent developments in EM research suppose a role for EMF in mobilizing nutrients from minerals (see Wallander, Chapter 14, this volume). In 1997, Jongmans et al. described small tunnel-like features in feldspar and hornblende grains from Swedish forest soils. These tunnels have the shape of fungal hyphae: A constant width between 3 and 10 mm, smooth borders and a rounded end. In that way they differ from other weathering phenomena such as etch pitches and cracks (Fig. 13.1). In some tunnels hyphae were found. Jongmans et al. (1997) postulated that EMF created these tunnels by mineral dissolution through the exudation of low molecular-weight organic compounds and subsequent removal of the weathering products. The weathering products like calcium, magnesium and potassium are supposed to be transported to the tree roots. In this way the host tree has direct access to mineral-bound nutrients, bypassing the bulk soil solution (van Breemen et al., 2000a; Landeweert et al., 2001). {\textcopyright} British Mycological Society 2006.

AB  - The effects of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) and ectomycorrhizae on plant ecology are considered, with emphasis on 4 areas. 1) Mycotrophy in wild plants. Many natives have lower nutrient demands than crop plants and may therefore be less responsive to mycorrhizal infection. 2) The role of mycorrhizae in competition. Mycorrhizae figure in plant-plant competition for limited resources. Mycorrhizae are probably involved in allelopathic interactions between plants. Mycorrhizae could aid in competition between plants and microorganisms. Mycorrhizal roots are sometimes found in humus layers of the forest floor. Mycorrhizal fungi may influence the decomposition of plant detritus. The most important role of mycorrhizal roots in the organic layer may often be a close physical association with the most nutrient-rich microsites of the heterogeneous soil volume. The ability to allocate absorbing tissue to localized organic matter zones has been documented for roots of forest trees and for hyphae of VAM fungi. The advantageous physical placement may result in greater nutrient acquisition for the plant than would occur if root and hyphal distribution were random. 3) The occurrence of mycorrhizae in natural communities has not frequently been documented in ways that show the abundance of infection in the whole community. 4) Carbon allocation to the symbiosis. Estimates for VAM from a few percent to approx 50% of gross photosynthesis can be reconciled to some extent by considering the dynamic processes of root and mycelial turnover.-from Authors

AB  - Knowledge about the effects of tree species on soil physicochemical and microbial properties is crucial for sustainable forest management. The evaluation of these effects in common garden experiments may be advantageous compared to natural conditions due to the reduction of confounding factors such as differences in topography, microclimate, the age of the tree stand, the admixture of other tree species or soil type. In this study, we assessed the effects of 14 tree species grown for nearly 50 years in monospecific plots in the Siemianice Experimental Forest in Poland on soil microbial community assessed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, namely total, bacterial (G+, G−) and fungal biomass, fungi/bacteria ratio, G+/G− ratio, and microbial community structure, as well as on soil chemical properties, namely pH, organic C, total Ca, K, Mg, N, P, exchangeable Ca, K, Mg, N-NH4, N-NO3, S-SO4, and C/N ratio. Species richness (species number) and cover of undergrowth vegetation were also assessed. We found only moderate effects of tree species identity on soil. Significant differences were found in fungal biomass, fungi/bacteria ratio, and microbial community structure, with the highest fungal biomass under Betula pendula and Quercus rubra. Among chemical parameters, significant differences were observed in soil pH and base cations concentrations. The highest values of these parameters were under Acer pseudoplatanus, A. platanoides, and Tilia cordata. Total microbial, bacterial (G−), fungal biomass, and fungi/bacteria ratio were significantly higher under broadleaf than under coniferous species, while for G+/G− ratio the opposite was observed. Tree species with arbuscular mycorrhiza did not generally differ in their effects on soil microbial biomass from those with ectomycorrhiza. Total microbial and G+ bacterial biomass correlated positively with soil elements, mainly base cations, C, and N, while very few correlations were found between soil chemical properties and G− bacteria and fungi. Species richness and cover of undergrowth vegetation were not related to any of soil microbial properties. The lack of correlations between soil element contents, undergrowth vegetation, and some microbial groups may suggest that these microorganisms are primarily influenced by other soil/litter properties, for example secondary metabolite concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 1. Although nitrogen-fixing plants play a crucial role in maintaining high ecosystem productivity, their effects on forest diversity are greatly debated. Legumes can reduce local diversity because of the fertilization effect; however, they can also facilitate species coexistence through complementary resource utilization. 2. In natural forests, nitrogen requirements and biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) vary widely among legumes. We used leaf nitrogen isotopic composition to differentiate the level of BNF activity among seven legumes across a steep gradient of soil available nitrogen within a 60-ha stem-mapping plot in a montane tropical rainforest in Hainan Island, China, and we evaluated their spatial distribution and neighbourhood diversity. 3. Results show that the levels of BNF activity are tightly correlated with legume association to available soil nitrogen, where legumes associated with nitrogen-rich habitats exhibit surprisingly greater BNF activity and a more diverse neighbourhood. 4. Synthesis. These findings indicate that legumes satisfy their nitrogen-demanding metabolism through a synergy of habitat preference and BNF activity. High BNF activity drives local diversity by promoting complementary resource utilization rather than intensifying above-ground competition. This may be achieved by improving litter quality and stimulating mycorrhizal and microbial diversity. The abundance of nitrogen fixers in nitrogen-rich habitats also explains how legumes contribute to maintaining high levels of soil nitrogen in tropical forests. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors.

AB  - In the rhizosphere, biotic and abiotic processes interact to create a zone distinct from the bulk soil that may strongly influence the biogeochemistry of forest ecosystems. This paper presents a conceptual model based upon three operationally defined soil-root compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere and soil-root interface) to assess nutrient availability in the mineral soil-root system. The model is supported by chemical and mineralogical analyses from bulk and rhizosphere soils collected from a Norway spruce forest. The rhizosphere was more intensively weathered and had accumulated more acidity, base cations and phosphorus than the bulk soil. The quantity and quality of organic matter regulate the reciprocal relationships between soil and roots with their associated biota. However, the biogeochemical role of organic matter in the rhizosphere still remains as an area in which more future research is needed. The mechanisms that may regulate nutrient availability in the rhizosphere are also discussed and related to nutrient cycling and adaptation of forests growing under nutrient poor or perturbed conditions. We suggest that the rhizosphere is not an ephemeral environment in the soil, but persists over time and is resilient against perturbation as evinced by consistent differences between rhizosphere and bulk chemistry and mineralogy over wide range of field treatments.

AB  - We determined the influence of nutrient availability on the mechanisms used by plants to acquire nitrogen and phosphorus from the soil. Extracellular acid phosphatase production, mycorrhizal colonization, and N and P uptake capacities were measured in control, N-, and P-fertilized forests in three sites that varied in nutrient status from N limited to relatively fertile to P limited. Nitrogen fertilization increased extracellular phosphatase activity in all sites. Phosphorus additions consistently reduced phosphatase activity, mycorrhizal colonization, and P uptake capacity across sites. Our results indicate that these plants efficiently allocate resources to nutrient acquisition as suggested by an economic model. Investment in acquisition of a nutrient was greatest when that nutrient was limiting to growth, and plants appeared to allocate excess N to construction of extracellular phosphatases to acquire P. This increase in phosphatase production with N fertilization implies that even P-limited systems might respond to N deposition with greater productivity.

AB  - The mechanism behind the (13)C enrichment of fungi relative to plant materials is unclear and constrains the use of stable isotopes in studies of the carbon cycle in soils. Here, we examined whether isotopic fractionation during respiration contributes to this pattern by comparing delta(13)C signatures of respired CO(2), sporocarps and their associated plant materials, from 16 species of ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic fungi collected in a Norway spruce forest. The isotopic composition of respired CO(2) and sporocarps was positively correlated. The differences in delta(13)C between CO(2) and sporocarps were generally small, < +/- 1 parts per thousand in nine out of 16 species, and the average shift for all investigated species was 0.04 parts per thousand. However, when fungal groups were analysed separately, three out of six species of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes respired (13)C-enriched CO(2) (up to 1.6 parts per thousand), whereas three out of five species of polypores respired (13)C-depleted CO(2) (up to 1.7 parts per thousand; P < 0.05). The CO(2) and sporocarps were always (13)C-enriched compared with wood, litter or roots. Loss of (13)C-depleted CO(2) may have enriched some species in (13)C. However, that the CO(2) was consistently (13)C-enriched compared with plant materials implies that other processes must be found to explain the consistent (13)C-enrichment of fungal biomass compared with plant materials.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate how altitudinal gradients shape the composition of soil bacterial and fungal communities, humus forms and soil properties across six altitude levels in Hyrcanian forests. Soil microbiomes were characterized by sequencing amplicons of selected molecular markers. Soil chemistry and plant mycorrhizal type were the two dominant factors explaining variations in bacterial and fungal diversity, respectively. The lowest altitude level had more favorable conditions for the formation of mull humus and exhibited higher N and Ca contents. These conditions were also associated with a higher proportion of Betaproteobacteria, Acidimicrobia, Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae. Low soil and forest floor quality as well as lower bacterial and fungal diversity characterized higher altitude levels, along with a high proportion of shared bacterial (Thermoleophilia, Actinobacteria and Bacilli) and fungal (Eurotiomycetes and Mortierellomycota) taxa. Beech-dominated sites showed moderate soil quality and high bacterial (Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes and Bacteroidetes) and fungal (Basidiomycota) diversity. Particularly, the Basidiomycota were well represented in pure beech forests at an altitude of 1500 m. In fertile and nitrogen rich soils with neutral pH, soil quality decreased along the altitudinal gradient, indicating that microbial diversity and forest floor decomposition were likely constrained by climatic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Ja{\'{i}}ba Project is an irrigation enterprise and its forest reserve is one of the largest protected areas of dry deciduous forest of Caatinga. However, two accidental fires burned about 90% of the area, resulting on the elimination of the trees. This study intended to evaluate the effects of dual inoculation with Rhizobium and mycorrhizal fungi on growth of Anadenanthera peregrina and its contribution to intercropped native species (Myracrodruon urundeuva Fr. Allem., Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. and Acacia sp.) and to increase the soil nutrients through litter decomposition as a strategy for the restoration of the reserve. The plants of Anadenanthera peregrina which were inoculated with rhizobia strain BHICB-A10 and associated with AM, showed a significant increase in height and total nitrogen content over that uninoculated plants. In plots where A. peregrina was inoculated, growth and survival of intercropped plants as Myracrodruon urundeuva, were favoured. This result may be explained by the faster decomposition rate of M. urundeuva litter and by the increase of soil nutrients which was related with its lowest lignocellulous content. The mixture of A. peregrina with M. urundeuva was the best model for restoration.

AB  - Sporophore abundance of putatively ectomycorrhizal fungi was compared in a mature mixed hardwood/conifer forest inside of (+) versus outside of (-) Rhododendron maximum thickets (RmT). Experimental blocks (1/4 ha) were established inside of (3) and outside of (3) RmT at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in Macon County., North Carolina, USA. Litter and organic layer substrates were removed, composited and redistributed among 90 2 x 2m plots within the blocks. Plots received either +RmT or -RmT litter, and either +RmT or -RmT organic layers, or were unmanipulated for controls. Sporophores of 67 putatively ectomycorrhizal species were collected from the blocks. Species diversity and overall community structure were similar inside of and outside of RmTs, and no grouping was detected by substrate type. Differences within the ectomycorrhizal fungus community were associated only weakly, with environmental parameters, as indicated by ordination. In light of these results, recent observations of ectomycorrhizal suppression and strong shifts in the proportions of morphotypes on tree seedlings inside of RmT do not appear to be related to differences in sporophore distributions. The changes in seedling mycobiont dominance in relation to RmT and the influence this has on seedling health should be examined directly from root tips.

AB  - Recolonisation of rehabilitated mine sites by (i) vesicular arbuscular (va) mycorrhizal and (ii) ectomycorrhizal fungi was examined and compared with populations of these fungi in surrounding native (jarrah) forest. While Eucalyptus marginata was the dominant tree species in the latter, four species of Eucalyptus, in even-aged stands ranging from 1 to 7 years old, had been planted on the former mine sites. Diversity and abundance of both types of fungi increased with stand age on the rehabilitated sites. In a 7-year-old stand, the number of va species, the abundance of their spores, and the percentage of roots colonized by them were comparable to their levels of activity in native forest. Numbers of species of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with 7-year-old stands were less than half of those associated with native forest, with only a few species being common to both habitats. This difference is probably indicative of the early phase of development of the rehabilitated sites. A clearly defined succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi was observed as the stands of trees increased in age, the changes being correlated with the development of a layer of leaf litter. There was a close relationship between the identities of fungi producing fruitbodies and being responsible for the formation of ectomycorrhizae. {\textcopyright} 1988.

AB  - Abstract: It is noted that plant roots make a significant contribution to the formation of technozems during self-overgrowing of the technogenic substrate. The rate of decomposition of a mixture of fine roots (<0.5 mm thick) of meadow arbuscular mycorrhiza species (AM) in comparison with forest ecto mycorrhiza species (EM) in the ash substrate from the power station was studied in a 150-day experiment in the laboratory. Differences in the rates of decomposition of root mixtures, as well as in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content before and after decomposition in different variations of the experiment, have been revealed. AM species have higher losses of biomass, nitrogen, and carbon in contradistinction to ЕM species. {\textcopyright} 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - Potassium (K), an element required slightly lower than nitrogen (N), is one of the essential major nutrients for trees in forests. K deficiency inhibits tree growth and limits forest productivities. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are one of important microorganisms in forests. Many forest trees have evolved mutualistic symbioses with the fungi that contribute to their nutrition and growth. In the fungus-tree associations, the fungi obtain carbohydrates from host trees and, in turn, provide the plants with mineral nutrients such as phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and K. In our present experiment, ectomycorrhizal fungi isolated from pine and eucalyptus forests were grown in liquid culture media with various K supplies (26, 130, and 650 mg/ L K2 SO4) and with Ca2+ signal and anion channel inhibitors such as Trifluoperazine, TFP; Verapamil, VP; Ruthenium red, RR and Niflumic acid, NIF. The efflux of acetate and protons by the fungal isolates in the response to the K supplies and inhibitors were studied in vitro in order to understand the mechanisms of ectomycorrhizal fungi to improve the nutrition of host plants. The results indicated that the fungal species varied greatly in both growth and nutrient absorption (N, P and K). The hyphae biomass at harvest, for example, showed at least twice difference, ranging from 52.91 mg/ flask to 121.72 mg/ flask. The reasons for the variations in growth and nutrition could be explained by the biological adaption to soil nutrient environments where they lived for a long time through evolution and selection. Oxalate, acetate, malate, citrate, succinate and large amount of protons were detected in the culture solutions. Taking into the account of dissolution and decomposition of minerals and rocks caused by protons and organic acids, ectomycorrhizal fungi could thus make K in mineral structures available for the host plants. In addition, all study fungi released acetate into liquid culture media and the low K supply stimulated significantly the acetate efflux. The efflux rate correlated negatively with K concentration in culture solutions (r= - 0.734, n= 60) and fungal K absorption (r= - 0.617, n= 60). In forest soils, therefore, the influence of K on acetate efflux by the external hyphae of ectomycorrhizas could be physiologically and ecologically important for the improvement of tree K nutrition at low K supply but prevention against K leaching in fertile soils. The inhibitors of Ca signals and anion channels decreased the acetate efflux by ectomycorrhizal fungal isolates in culture solutions with low K supply. It seems reasonable to suggest both Ca signals and anion channels involved the process of the fungal acetate exudation in this case. The primary signal of K deficiencies could act as the intracellular second messenger to react on calmodulin (CaM), by which changed the Ca2+ distribution inside and outside of the hyphae cells, and then stimulated the cascade reactions responsible for acetate efflux, including gene expression, acetate synthesis and anion channel activation. Concerning the difference between the ectomycorrhizas in the field and the fungal isolates in vitro, further investigation is necessary to carry out on the mechanisms of the detail processes with ectomycorrhizal trees.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) deposition can enhance carbon (C) capture and storage in northern coniferous forests but it may also enhance the demand for phosphorus (P). While it is well established that long-term N enrichment can decrease decomposition and enhance the accumulation of C in soils, it remains uncertain if a higher demand and acquisition of P influence soil C. We studied microbial phosphorus mobilization and growth within a long-term N enrichment experiment in a Norway spruce forest, where N deposition was simulated by adding 0, 12.5 or 50 kg N ha−1 year−1 for 21 years (n = 12), by incubating microbial ingrowth cores with needles and humus with low and high P content, and with sand with and without mineral apatite P. Long-term N enrichment had no effect on microbial P mobilization in needles and humus and did not enhance the positive effect that apatite had on fungal growth. However, it consistently strengthened the retention of C in the soil by decreasing decomposition of needle and humus, both with low and high P content, and by increasing fungal growth in sand-filled ingrowth cores. Furthermore, we did not find any evidence that higher microbial P mobilization in response to N enrichment affected soil C storage. These results show that long-term N enrichment in relatively young soils dominated by coniferous trees and ectomycorrhizal fungi can have relatively small impact on microbial P mobilization from organic sources and on the potential to mobilize P from minerals, and subsequently that elevated P demand due to N enrichment is unlikely to lead to a reduction in the soil C accumulation rate.

AB  - Ultrastructural and cytochemical techniques showed that there was a marked difference in the structure and cytochemistry of the hyphae from old and young parts of mycelial strands produced by the mycorrhizas of Pinus radiata D. Don. The older strands were differentiated into an outer region of thick walled hyphae and inner region of thin walled hyphae of two types. Histochemical tests for carbohydrates were used to distinguish between gels produced by the micro‐organisms associated with the strands and those by the fungal hyphae themselves, and to distinguish between the polysaccharides of the mycelial gel and those of the layers in the cell walls of the hyphae. Carbohydrate distribution in and on the strands is discussed in relation to the breakdown of litter and to the stability of soil crumbs under pine forests.

AB  - We analyzed the influence of above- and belowground factors on the soil microbial community in a Chinese subtropical forest, one of the most diverse biomes in the northern hemisphere. Soil samples were taken at different depths from four replicate comparative study plots in each of three forest age classes (young 10-40 years, medium 40-80 years, old ≥80 years). Microbial biomass and community structure were then determined using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, and basal respiration and microbial biomass carbon (C mic) were determined by substrate-induced respiration. These data were then related to plant community and soil variables using non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis and post-hoc permutational correlations. We found that microbial lipid composition and abundance were not related to forest age class. Instead, microbial lipid composition and abundance were related to factors reflecting primary production, i. e., percent litter cover, percent dead wood cover, and percent tree layer cover. Specifically, the relative abundance (mol fraction) of indicators for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were positively significantly correlated with percent litter cover. We also found that the biomass of all microbial groups and total PLFA were negatively significantly related to percent deadwood cover. In addition, pH H2O was the only soil parameter that was correlated significantly to microbial biomass. Our results indicate that overarching ecological factors such as plant productivity and soil pH are important factors influencing the soil microbial community, both in terms of biomass and of community composition in this subtropical ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Background & Aims: Oak seedling establishment is difficult and may be partly explained by litter-mediated interactions with neighbors. Litter effects can be physical or chemical and result in positive or negative feedback effects for seedlings. Mediterranean species leaves contain high levels of secondary metabolites which suggest that negative litter effects could be important. Methods: Seedlings of Quercus ilex and Quercus pubescens were grown for two years in pots with natural soil and litter inputs from 6 Mediterranean woody species, artificial litter (only physical effect) or bare soil. Results: Litter types had highly different mass loss (41–80%), which correlated with soil organic C, total N and microbial activity. Litter of Q. pubescens increased soil humidity and oak seedlings aerial biomass. Litters of Cotinus coggygria and Rosmarinus officinalis, containing high quantities of phenolics and terpenes respectively, decomposed fast and led to specific soil microbial catabolic profiles but did not influence oak seedling growth, chemistry or mycorrhization rates. Conclusions: Physical litter effects through improved soil humidity seem to be predominant for oak seedling development. Despite high litter phenolics content, we detected no chemical effects on oak seedlings. Litter traits conferring a higher ability to retain soil moisture in dry periods deserve further attention as they may be critical to explain plant-soil feedbacks in Mediterranean ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - <p> Plant–microbial interactions in the litter layer represent one of the most relevant interactions for biogeochemical cycling as litter decomposition is a key first step in carbon and nitrogen turnover. However, our understanding of these interactions in the litter layer remains elusive. In an old-growth mixed <italic>Nothofagus</italic> forest in Patagonia, we studied the effects of single tree species identity and the mixture of three tree species on the fungal and bacterial composition in the litter layer. We also evaluated the effects of nitrogen (N) addition on these plant–microbial interactions. In addition, we compared the magnitude of stimulation of litter decomposition due to home field advantage (HFA, decomposition occurs more rapidly when litter is placed beneath the plant species from which it had been derived than beneath a different plant species) and N addition that we previously demonstrated in this same forest, and used microbial information to interpret these results. Tree species identity had a strong and significant effect on the composition of fungal communities but not on the bacterial community of the litter layer. The microbial composition of the litter layer under the tree species mixture show an averaged contribution of each single tree species. N addition did not erase the plant species footprint on the fungal community, and neither altered the bacterial community. N addition stimulated litter decomposition as much as HFA for certain tree species, but the mechanisms behind N and HFA stimulation may have differed. Our results suggest that stimulation of decomposition from N addition might have occurred due to increased microbial activity without large changes in microbial community composition, while HFA may have resulted principally from plant species' effects on the litter fungal community. Together, our results suggest that plant–microbial interactions can be an unconsidered driver of litter decomposition in temperate forests. </p>

AB  - Fungal communities are important for carbon (C) transformations in boreal forests that are one of the largest C pools in terrestrial ecosystems, warranting thus further investigation of fungal community dynamics in time and space. We investigated fungal diversity and community composition seasonally and across defined soil horizons in boreal Scots pine forest in Finland using 454 pyrosequencing. We collected a total of 120 samples from five vertical soil horizons monthly from March to October; in March, under snow. Boreal forest soil generally harbored diverse fungal communities across soil horizons. The communities shifted drastically and rapidly over time. In late winter, saprotrophs dominated the community and were replaced by ectomycorrhizal fungi during the growing season. Our studies are among the first to dissect the spatial and temporal dynamics in boreal forest ecosystems and highlights the ecological importance of vertically distinct communities and their rapid seasonal dynamics. As climate change is predicted to result in warmer and longer snow-free winter seasons, as well as increase the rooting depth of trees in boreal forest, the seasonal and vertical distribution of fungal communities may change. These changes are likely to affect the organic matter decomposition by the soil-inhabiting fungi and thus alter organic C pools.Fungal communities were diverse also in deeper soil horizons, and they varied significantly both vertically and seasonally; community structure in winter was the most different compared to the growing season.Fungal communities were diverse also in deeper soil horizons, and they varied significantly both vertically and seasonally; community structure in winter was the most different compared to the growing season.

AB  - Plant–soil interactions link ecosystem fertility and organic matter accumulation below ground. Soil microorganisms play a central role as mediators of these interactions, but mechanistic understanding is still largely lacking. Correlative data from a coniferous forest ecosystem support the hypothesis that interactions between fungal guilds play a central role in regulating organic matter accumulation in relation to fertility. With increasing ecosystem fertility, the proportion of saprotrophic basidiomycetes increased in deeper organic layers, at the expense of ectomycorrhizal fungal species. Saprotrophs correlated positively with the activity of oxidative enzymes, which in turn favoured organic matter turnover and nitrogen recycling to plants. Combined, our findings are consistent with a fungus-mediated feedback loop, which results in a negative correlation between ecosystem fertility and below-ground carbon storage. These findings call for a shift in focus from plant litter traits to fungal traits in explaining organic matter dynamics and ecosystem fertility in boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS

AB  - Habitat heterogeneity is an important driver of aboveground species diversity but few studies have investigated effects on soil communities. Trees shape their surrounding by both leaf litter and roots generating small scale heterogeneity and potentially governing community patterns of soil organisms. To assess the role of vegetation for the soil fauna, we studied whether tree species (Fagus sylvatica L., Acer pseudoplatanus L., Fraxinus excelsior L., Tilia cordata Mill.), markedly differing in leaf litter quality and root associated mycorrhizal symbionts, affect oribatid mite communities by shaping below- and aboveground resources and habitat complexity and availability. Oribatid mite abundance, species richness, community structure and the proportion of litter living and parthenogenetic individuals were analyzed and related to microbial biomass and the amount of remaining litter mass. Although leaf litter species with higher nutritional values decomposed considerably faster, microbial biomass only slightly differed between leaf litter species. Neither root species nor leaf litter species affected abundance, species richness or community structure of oribatid mites. However, root species had an effect on the proportion of parthenogenetic individuals with increased proportions in the presence of beech roots. Overall, the results suggest that identity and diversity of vegetation via leaf litter or roots are of minor importance for structuring oribatid mite communities of a temperate forest ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2019 Bluhm et al.

AB  - Forest soils store large amounts of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), yet how predicted shifts in forest composition will impact long-term C and N persistence remains poorly understood. A recent hypothesis predicts that soils under trees associated with arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) store less C than soils dominated by trees associated with ectomycorrhizas (ECM), due to slower decomposition in ECM-dominated forests. However, an incipient hypothesis predicts that systems with rapid decomposition—e.g. most AM-dominated forests—enhance soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization by accelerating the production of microbial residues. To address these contrasting predictions, we quantified soil C and N to 1 m depth across gradients of ECM-dominance in three temperate forests. By focusing on sites where AM- and ECM-plants co-occur, our analysis controls for climatic factors that covary with mycorrhizal dominance across broad scales. We found that while ECM stands contain more SOM in topsoil, AM stands contain more SOM when subsoil to 1 m depth is included. Biomarkers and soil fractionations reveal that these patterns are driven by an accumulation of microbial residues in AM-dominated soils. Collectively, our results support emerging theory on SOM formation, demonstrate the importance of subsurface soils in mediating plant effects on soil C and N, and indicate that shifts in the mycorrhizal composition of temperate forests may alter the stabilization of SOM. {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Past inability to come to a consensus about the degree of functional redundancy in ecosystems may be due, in part, to different definitions of ecosystem function and different investigative methodologies. Here I define ecosystem function, using the largely plant-based functions of aboveground productivity and decomposition of 10 common early successional trees found in Puerto Rico, and then use two different multivariate techniques to define functional groups. I found that: (1) multivariate statistical methods worked well to sort out the test species on axes defined primarily by productivity, which may have more redundancy than decomposition, and initial leaf nutrient content, (2) there were four plant functional groups defined by species (i) Psychotria berteriana, (ii) Cecropia schreberiana, (iii) Inga vera, and (iv) a group containing the other seven species, and (3) the plant traits of nitrogen-fixing capacity and mycorrhizal strategy mapped better onto these groups then those of seed size, wood density, shade tolerance or successional status. Finally, implications for key plant structures and for conservation of Neotropical areas are discussed.

AB  - We examined the number of enchytraeids and nematodes in the mor humus layer of polluted Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands, located on a sulphur gradient from 1.2 to 2.8 mg g-1 in mor humus and up to a distance of 40 km from the centre of Oulu, an industrialized city in northern Finland, in autumn 1989 and spring 1990. The number of enchytraeids, dominated by one species, Cognettia sphagnetorum, showed a clear positive correlation with the soil respiration rate and the diversity and production of mycorrhizal fungi, and all these were negatively related with S and N concentrations in the soil, as measured in 1987 and 1988. This negative correlation may have been caused by an alteration in food supply of enchytraeids, owing to changes in litter quality and the amount and species composition of fungi and mycorrhizae. Nematode numbers showed a positive correlation with the activity of dehydrogenase enzymes mineral N, and soil pH. The feeding characteristics of nematodes as a group need further study. The numbers of both enchytraeids and nematodes were higher in the autumn than in the spring and in the case of nematodes this variation was related to soil moisture. {\textcopyright} 1992 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Agaricomycetes are represented by 180 species in the birch forests of the study area. 89 species or 49.4% are symbiotrophs, 65 species of which being associated with nemoral type weeping birch forests growing on grey forest soils of watersheds. 42 species live in pubescent white birch forests of bilberry-moss group in the “near a swamp” communities. The communities under consideration differ significantly from each other in the species composition of symbiotrophs. 20 species are in common with them. Ectomycorrhiza-formers are subdivided into two groups. The first one contains the fungi of early stage of root system colonization. These are the species of Hebeloma, Inocybe, Laccaria, and Paxillus genera. The second group includes the mushrooms of the late stage. The representatives of Boletus, Lactarius, Leccinum, and Russula genera and others belong to them. In the birch forests 59 species of xylotrophs have been identified. The obligate parasites developing only on the living trees are represented by Inonotus obliquus f. sterilis and Polyporus umbellatus, facultative saprotrophs - by eight species, facultative parasites - by ten, saprotrophs - by 39 ones. In the study area only 3 from 59 species of wood-destroying fungi are solely associated with birch wood. 6 species prefer birch wood but they also may be found on other trees. The remaining species of xylotrophs also occur in other deciduous species and do not favor the species in question. In addition, 4 species with a very broad ecological valence concerning the feeding substrate are registered in the birch forests, these species occurring not only in deciduous, but also in coniferous species. Litter and humus saprotrophs are represented in birch forests by 23 species. All of them are widely distributed in other types of forests, and among them species specific for birch forests are absent. In the bogged birch forests the ground cover is formed by sphagnum mosses. Fungi belonging to the trophic group of bryotrophs which are represented in these conditions by nine species develop among them. The use of birch in protective forest planting and its active expansion on derelict agricultural land resulted in significant changes of the number of agaricomycetes individual species and the structure of edible mushrooms resources. {\textcopyright} 2019, Russian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The long-term influence of climate change on spatio-temporal dynamics of the Polar mycobiota was analyzed on the eastern macro slope of the Polar Urals (Sob River valley and Mountain Slantsevaya) over a period of 60 years. The anthropogenic impact is minimal in the study area. Effects of environmental warming were addressed as changes in treeline and forest communities (greening of the vegetation). With warming, permafrost is beginning to thaw, and as it thaws, it decomposes. Therefore, we also included depth of soil thawing and litter decomposition in our study. Particular attention was paid to the reaction of aphyllophoroid fungal communities concerning these factors. Our results provide evidence for drastic changes in the mycobiota due to global warming. Fungal community composition followed changes of the vegetation, which was transforming from forest-tundra to northern boreal type forests during the last 60 years. Key fungal groups of the ongoing borealization and important indicator species are discussed. Increased economic activity in the area may lead to deforestation, destruction of swamps, and meadows. However, this special environment provides important services such as carbon sequestration, soil formation, protecting against flood risks, and filtering of air. In this regard, we propose to include the studied territory in the Polarnouralsky Natural Park. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Fungal symbioses with plants are ubiquitous, ancient, and vital to both ecosystem function and plant health. However, benefits to fungal symbionts are not well explored, especially in non-mycorrhizal fungi. The Foraging Ascomycete hypothesis proposes that some wood-decomposing fungi may shift life-history strategies to endophytism to bridge gaps in time and space between suitable substrates. To test this hypothesis we examine spatial relationships of Xylaria endophytic fungi in the forest canopy with Xylaria decomposer fungi on the forest floor. We sampled for fungi of the genus Xylaria using a spatially explicit sampling scheme in a remote Ecuadorian cloud forest, and concurrently carried out an extensive culture-based sampling of fungal foliar endophytes. We found 36 species of Xylaria in our 0.5 ha plot, 31 of which were found to only occur as fruiting bodies. All five species of Xylaria found as endophytes were also found as fruiting bodies. We also tested the relationships of both stages of these fungi to environmental variables. Decomposer fungi were differentiated by species-specific habitat preferences, with three species being found closer to water than expected by chance. In contrast, endophytes displayed no sensitivity to environmental conditions, such as host, moisture, or canopy cover. We found evidence of spatial linkage between life stages in two species. We also demonstrate that direct transmission of endophytes from leaves to woody substrates is possible. These results indicate that endophytism may represent one way for decomposer fungi to escape moisture limitation, and that endophytic fungi may act as sources of dispersal for decomposer fungi consistent with predictions of the Foraging Ascomycete hypothesis. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.

AB  - The importance of mycorrhizas in heathland and boreal forest biomes, which together cover much of the landmass of the Northern Hemisphere and store most of the global stocks of carbon, is reviewed. The taxonomic affinities of the organisms forming these symbiotic partnerships are assessed, and the distinctive structural features of the ericoid mycorrhizas of heathland dwarf shrubs and the ectomycorrhizas of boreal forest trees are described. It is stressed that neither in terms of the geographical distribution of the plants nor in terms of the occurrence of their characteristic mycorrhizas in the soil profile should these biomes be considered to be mutually exclusive. What unites them is their apparent affinity for acidic organic soils of inherently low accessibility of the major nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). These properties relate directly to the nature of the nutrient-poor recalcitrant litter produced by their host plants and through positive-feedback mechanisms that are reinforced by selective removal of labile nutrients by the mycorrhizas. We suggest that coevolution of these plant litter traits with mycorrhizal associations that are adapted to them has been one of the defining features of these ecosystems. Ericoid and ectomycorrhizal fungi have biochemical and physiological attributes that make them highly efficient at scavenging for organic sources of N and P in surface soil horizons. In so doing, they restrict supplies of these elements to the decomposer communities. Case studies involving exploitation of N and P in defined organic substrates are described. In both biomes the dominant plants depend upon the abilities of their fungal partners to recover nutrients, so the symbioses control nutrient cycles, productivity, species composition, and functioning of these ecosystems. It is in this context that the fungal symbionts are here considered to be drivers of nutritional processes in their respective biomes. Through their influences upon the quality of carbon residues mycorrhizal fungi must also affect the sink-source balance for this key element in soil. There is an urgent need for the evaluation of the relative contributions of symbiotic and saprotrophic components of the microflora to the processes of carbon storage and cycling in these biomes, particularly in the context of global climate change and impacts of anthropogenic pollutant N deposition.

AB  - The species composition of macrofungal communities in 12 stands of planted Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karsten.) across lowland England was assessed over three consecutive years, and related to stand structure and site characteristics. Results indicate that these plantations provide a habitat for diverse communities of macrofungi: a total of 343 species were recorded, of which 171 were found to be unique to pine, and 90 unique to spruce. The composition of these communities was found to differ markedly between forest areas and between plots within individual forests, with only three species common to all assessment plots. Calculation of Jaccard similarity coefficients indicated a 22-24\% association between chronosequence stages in the two pine sites, and 20\% in the two spruce sites. Fungi were classified into four functional groups based on their mode of nutrition: wood saprotrophs, litter saprotrophs, mycorrhizal and parasitic species. This enabled patterns of diversity to be related to stand structure and a range of site factors (based on soil chemical analyses). Positive relationships were recorded between increased volume of deadwood and the number of species of wood saprotrophs, and also between the species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi and the number of tree species present in each plot. Significant correlations were also recorded between the number of parasitic fungal species and soil pH (a positive response to increasing alkalinity), and between the number of litter colonizing saprotrophs and tree species richness. These results suggest that indicators of macrofungal diversity, based on relatively simple habitat assessments, could be developed for incorporation into forest management plans. These data also highlight the importance of maintaining adequate volumes of deadwood, and variety of tree species, permitting the development of diverse communities of macrofungi in forest stands; (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Deep Woods is the site of an all taxa biodiversity inventory (ATBI) overseen by the Ohio Biological Survey. Deep Woods encompasses 114 ha comprised of a diversity of habitats including fields, lowland and upland forests, riparian forest, hemlock ravines, sandstone outcrops, and rockhouse formations. During the 2002 growing season, the property was surveyed approximately every 10 days and fungi were collected and identified. In total, 92 species were collected with 12 species of ascomycetes, 74 species of basidiomycetes and 6 unknown. The fungi identified to species were further divided into groups based upon ecological guild: 13 soil-inhabiting, 7 litter-inbabiting, 50 wood-inhabiting, 13 mycorrhizal species, and 3 ``other.{''} Our data indicate a diverse assemblage of macrofungi that is comparable to other studies in the Central Hardwood Region. Due to the ephemeral nature of fungal basidiomata, multiple years of study would certainly expand the species list.

AB  - The spores of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are shown to occur regularly within the mounds of grass-, litter- and wood-feeding termites in Australian savannah and forest environments, except in closed-forest environments lacking putative ECM host species. The spore population densities in mound materials are substantially greater and the communities more diverse at the generic level than those of soils adjacent to putative hosts. Many genera are common to both locations. Some implications of the presence of these fungi for nutrient flow and local diversity are considered. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier SAS.

AB  - We report the effects of pine and oak litter on species composition and diversity of mycorrhizal fungi colonizing 2-year-old Pinus sylvestris L. seedlings grown in a bare-root nursery in Lithuania. A layer of pine or oak litter was placed on the surface of the nursery bed soil to mimic natural litter cover. Oak litter amendment appeared to be most favorable for seedling survival, with a 73% survival rate, in contrast to the untreated mineral bed soil (44%). The concentrations of total N, P, K, Ca, and Mg were higher in oak growth medium than in pine growth medium. Relative to the control (pH 6.1), the pH was lower in pine growth medium (5.8) and higher in oak growth medium (6.3). There were also twofold and threefold increases in the C content of growth medium with the addition of pine and oak litter, respectively. Among seven mycorrhizal morphotypes, eight different mycorrhizal taxa were identified: Suillus luteus, Suillus variegatus, Wilcoxina mikolae, a Tuber sp., a Tomentella sp., Cenococcum geophilum, Amphinema byssoides, and one unidentified ectomycorrhizal symbiont. Forest litter addition affected the relative abundance of mycorrhizal symbionts more than their overall representation. This was more pronounced for pine litter than for oak litter, with 40% and 25% increases in the abundance of suilloid mycorrhizae, respectively. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that changes in the supply of organic matter through litter manipulation may have far-reaching effects on the chemistry of soil, thus influencing the growth and survival of Scots pine seedlings and their mycorrhizal communities.

AB  - Roots of most terrestrial plants form symbiotic associations with fungi. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are widespread and abundant. They are formed by bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms and are ubiquitous in most temperate and tropical ecosystems including agricultural systems. Ectomycorrhizas occur in certain families of woody gymnosperms and angiosperms and are extremely important in many temperate and boreal forests. The plant order Ericales contains a natural group of closely related families with worldwide distribution. Except for orchid and monotropoid associations, mycorrhizas involve plant exchange of photosynthates in return for a fungal exchange of mineral nutrients. The convergence of so many unrelated forms of mycorrhizas is a testament for the mutual benefits of these trading partnerships. Mycorrhizal interactions influence the species composition, diversity, and stability of biotic communities. Mycorrhizal fungi co-inhabit the rhizosphere with many saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi. One of the most important functions of mycorrhizas is their role in physically structuring soils. The total effect of roots and associated mycorrhizal fungi on soil structure is related to their turnover and decomposition rates. Aerts suggested that variation in access to different nutrient pools among various types of mycorrhizal fungi leads to positive feedback between the dominant plants in an ecosystem and litter decomposition. The average global temperature has risen since the early 1980s, and it has been predicted that the land surface temperature will increase by 3.1° C by 2085. The analytical challenge of holistic studies of complex interactions among communities of rhizosphere organisms and the environment is daunting. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi have received increasing attention as regulators of below-ground organic matter storage. They are proposed to promote organic matter accumulation by suppressing saprotrophs, but have also been suggested to play an active role in decomposition themselves. Here we show that exclusion of tree roots and associated ectomycorrhizal fungi in a boreal forest increased decomposition of surface litter by 11% by alleviating nitrogen limitation of saprotrophs–a “Gadgil effect”. At the same time, root exclusion decreased Mn-peroxidase activity in the deeper mor layer by 91%. Our results show that ectomycorrhizal fungi may hamper short-term litter decomposition, but also support a crucial role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in driving long-term organic matter oxidation. These observations stress the importance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in regulation of below-ground organic matter accumulation. By different mechanisms they may either hamper or stimulate decomposition, depending upon stage of decomposition and location in the soil profile.

AB  - The influence of forest management on fungal diversity and community composition has been the subject of a wide number of studies over the last two decades. However, the difficulty of studying the complex kingdom of fungi under real forest conditions has led to rather scattered scientific knowledge. Here, we provide the current state of knowledge suggesting future research directions regarding (i) stand structure attributes (age, tree cover, stand density, tree species composition), (ii) management history (managed vs unmanaged), (iii) silvicultural treatments (thinning, clearcutting, shelterwood methods, selective cutting) and (iv) other anthropogenic disturbances (mushroom picking, salvage logging, prescribed burning, fertilization) affecting fungal diversity and community composition. The reviewed studies reported a positive correlation between fungal diversity and stand structure variables such as canopy cover, basal area of the stand and tree species diversity, particularly for mycorrhizal species. Abundance and diversity in size, tree species and decomposition stage of deadwood are reported as positively related to richness of wood-inhabiting fungi. The main findings about the effects of silvicultural practices suggest that the higher is the management intensity the lower is the diversity of ectomycorrhizal and wood-inhabiting species, at least in the short term. We have therefore reported those silvicultural practices which may reduce trade-offs between timber harvesting and fungal diversity conservation. Indeed, fungal diversity can be conserved in managed forests if (i) low impact logging operations are performed; (ii) stand structural complexity and late-successional forest characteristics are enhanced; (iii) deadwood amount and diversity is promoted, (iv) landscape heterogeneity and connectivity is improved or maintained. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Temperate ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi show segregation whereby some species dominate in organic layers and others favor mineral soils. Weak layering in tropical soils is hypothesized to decrease niche space and therefore reduce the diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The Neotropical ECM tree Dicymbe corymbosa forms monodominant stands and has a distinct physiognomy with vertical crown development, adventitious roots and massive root mounds, leading to multi-stemmed trees with spatially segregated rooting environments: aerial litter caches, aerial decayed wood, organic root mounds and mineral soil. We hypothesized that these microhabitats host distinct fungal assemblages and therefore promote diversity. To test our hypothesis, we sampled D. corymbosa ectomycorrhizal root tips from the four microhabitats and analyzed community composition based on pyrosequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) barcode markers. Several dominant fungi were ubiquitous but analyses nonetheless suggested that communities in mineral soil samples were statistically distinct from communities in organic microhabitats. These data indicate that distinctive rooting zones of D. corymbosa contribute to spatial segregation of the fungal community and likely enhance fungal diversity. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: Pinus armandii distributes widely in the Erlang Mountain and is one of the dominant species in the community. The Erlang Mountain Forest Farm is located in Sichuan Province and it contains rich microbial resources. This article was intended to study the fungal diversity and analyze the relationship between fungal structure and their functions at the beginning of the P. armandii litter decomposition period. Method: The grinding method was used in this paper to isolate fungi on the P. armandii litter from the altitude of 2 750, 2 650, 2 510, and 2 460 m. The isolates were further indentified according to the morphology combined with PCR amplification and sequencing using the universal primers based on the ITS sequence of fungi. In addition, the Rhizosphaera was for the first time isolated from P. armandii, and the relevant research on the fungi is still insufficient. There remains controversy on the fungal role as a pathogen or weak parasitic fungus in foreign reports. The fungus was reported to cause disease on P. sylvestris var. mongolica in China in 2013. In this study, 12 strains of Rhizosphaera were isolated from the four elevations. To study the saprophytic performance, three strains of Rhizosphaera sp. with different morphological features, namely R. sp.1, R. sp.2 and R. sp.3, and one strain of Lophodermium erlangshanense were selected for decomposition test in vitro, in which the P. armandii litter is the sole substrate. Result: The isolation results showed that 23 fungi taxa were obtained. The imperfecti and ascomycetes were the major components that occupy 15 taxa and 5 taxa, respectively. All of the fungi belonged to 15 genera. Mucor, Trichoderma, Rhizosphaera, Penicillium and Talaromyces were isolated from the plots over the four different elevations, and were the abundant species. The filamentous fungi, such as Trichoderma, and Penicillium, which had the quantitative superiority and diversity, undoubtedly would play an important role in the process of litter decomposition. However, basidiomycete fungi, without abundant amount and species, might not participate in the decomposition at the early stage. The basidiomycete fungi originated from the environment may participate in the further lignin decomposition at the late stage. Through the determination of cellulose enzyme produced by the fungi, the activities of endoglucanase and $\beta$-glucosidase reach the maximum at the 13th day. The activities of Cellobiohydrolase reach the maximum at the 17th day. In general, there was no significant difference in the enzyme activities as well as the mass loss among the four strains. Those results indicated that Rhizosphaera sp. and L. erlangshanense could decompose the cellulose components, and there was a synergistic effect from the different cellulase enzymes (endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase, $\beta$-glucosidase). The mass loss decomposed by L. erlangshanense was 15.74%, while the loss caused by Rhizosphaera sp. ranged from 12.00% to 13.40%. According to the previous researches, L. erlangshanense was usually found in the litter and rarely in alive needles, suggesting that it may not cause the needle disease. Conclusion: The results indicated that filamentous fungi, such as Trichoderma, and Penicillium, played an important role at the beginning of the litter decomposition period. They were both the dominant species in the four different altitudes. Rhizosphaera sp. and L. erlangshanense were weak saprotrophic fungi in the P. armandii litter. However, it needs to be further verified that whether the capacity of cellulose decomposing enzyme is related to their pathogenicity. {\textcopyright} 2016, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

AB  - The release of carbon as CO2 from belowground processes accounts for about 70% of total ecosystem respiration. Insights about factors controlling soil CO2 efflux are constrained by the challenge of apportioning sources of CO2 between autotrophic tree roots (and mycorrhizal fungi) and heterotrophic microorganisms. In some temperate conifer forests, the reduction in soil CO2 efflux after girdling (phloem removal) has been used to separate these sources. Girdling stops the flow of carbohydrates to the belowground portion of the ecosystem, which should slow respiration by roots and mycorrhizae while heterotrophic respiration should remain constant or be enhanced by the decomposition of newly dead roots. Therefore, the reduction in CO2 efflux after girdling should be a conservative estimate of the belowground flux of C from trees. We tested this approach in two tropical Eucalyptus plantations. Tree canopies remained intact for more than 3 months after girdling, showing no reduction in light interception. The reduction in soil CO2 efflux averaged 16-24% for the 3-month period after girdling. The reduction in CO2 efflux was similar for plots with one half of the trees girdled and those with all of the trees girdled. Girdling did not reduce live fine root biomass for at least 5 months after treatment, indicating that large reserves of carbohydrates in the root systems of Eucalyptus trees maintained the roots and root respiration. Our results suggest that the girdling approach is unlikely to provide useful insights into the contribution of tree roots and heterotrophs to soil CO 2 efflux in this type of forest ecosystem. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.

AB  - The decomposition of soil organic matter in forest ecosystems is important in two ways. First, soil organic matter is the largest pool of C in terrestrial ecosystems, so understanding global carbon cycling requires an appreciation of the factors that control the size of that pool and the fluxes through it. Among these factors are those that control the rate of organic matter decomposition. Second, organic matter decomposition is the major process controlling the supply of nutrients to plants. In some ecosystems ectomycorrhizal. fungi comprise a surprisingly large fraction of soil organic matter. However, little is known of the rates of decomposition of ectomycorrhizal fungi, or of the factors that control those rates. Therefore, we set out to examine the relationship between N concentrations and decomposition rates of ectomycorrhizal fungi using a wide variety of strains isolated from a Pinus resinosa plantation. We found that substantial variation among strains existed in decomposition rate, and that decomposition rate was highly correlated with tissue N concentration. We conclude, therefore, that the structures of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities may be ecologically important in terms of ecosystem C and N dynamics.

AB  - Samanea saman(Jacq.) Merr is a tree species widely used in forest restoration plantations and its symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can promote seedling formation and establishment and growth in the field. The growth ofS. samanseedlings inoculated with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi grown on nine different substrates were evaluated in a greenhouse in this study. Seedling growth was promoted in substrates with lower bulk density and pH and higher total porosity, air-filled porosity and available Mg content. The nodulation of NFB was favored in the substrates with more available Mg, and AMF colonization and sporulation was favored in the substrates with a higher percentage of water buffering capacity. Seedlings produced on commercial substrates based on peat and pine bark showed superior growth. The peat-based ``Carolina Soil (TM) electrical conductivity (EC) 0.7{''} favored nodulation, while the sewage sludge substrates and clayey subsoil mixture plus 10\% poultry litter (V:V) promoted mycorrhizal colonization and sporulation.

AB  - Paradoxically, symbiotic dinitrogen (N<inf>2</inf>) fixers are abundant in nitrogen (N)-rich, phosphorus (P)- poor lowland tropical rain forests. One hypothesis to explain this pattern states that N<inf>2</inf> fixers have an advantage in acquiring soil P by producing more N-rich enzymes (phosphatases) that mineralise organic P than non-N<inf>2</inf> fixers. We assessed soil and root phosphatase activity between fixers and non-fixers in two lowland tropical rain forest sites, but also addressed the hypothesis that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonisation (another P acquisition strategy) is greater on fixers than non-fixers. Root phosphatase activity and AM colonisation were higher for fixers than nonfixers, and strong correlations between AM colonisation and N<inf>2</inf> fixation at both sites suggest that the N-P interactions mediated by fixers may generally apply across tropical forests. We suggest that phosphatase enzymes and AM fungi enhance the capacity of N<inf>2</inf> fixers to acquire soil P, thus contributing to their high abundance in tropical forests. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.

AB  - We investigated how habitat characteristics and in particular the level of disturbance was affecting colonisation processes and population dynamics of all ectomycorrhizal fungus. The basidiomycete Hebeloma cylindrosporum associated with Pinus pinaster trees occurs in two distinct habitats within the forest dune ecosystem along the Atlantic coast of France. The `dune habitat' (D habitat) is characterised by scattered trees growing in almost pure sand at the extreme fringe of the forest marking the transition with the bare dune. The `forest habitat' (F habitat) is within tile]nature forest in places of high human frequentation which prevents litter and humus accumulation. We studied over several years (up to ten) populations of H. cylin-drosporum present in three geographic sites. Within each Site We Studied two areas corresponding each to one of the two possible habitats. In all sampled areas fruit bodies occurred within discrete patches of ground. Although all interaction between habitat and geographic site existed, habitat had significant effects on patch sizes and patch internal densities. Compared to the F habitat, patches in the D habitat were significantly larger and presented a lower density of fruit bodies. Patches very seldom occurred at the same place from one year to the next in the F habitat when ill most cases they were perennial and increased in size in the D habitat. Fruit body size, which reflects reproductive output of the genets, differed between the two habitats (means of the cap diameters of 25.6 and 40.4 mm in respectively the F and D habitats). Almost all patches in the F habitat were made of several annual genets each producing on average 1.6 fruit bodies while most patches ill the D habitat were dominated by one perennial genet which could Simultaneously produce up to 60 fruit bodies. Under-representation of small sized genets in the D habitat suggests a low level of sexual recruitment in this habitat despite the large number of fruit bodies (and therefore of spores) produced by each of the existing genets. We therefore suggest that H. cylindrosporum could be considered as a fugitive species. Genets of this species survive in the D habitat in which few ectomycorrhizal fungal competitors occur. This habitat Could represent the optimal habitat for this species. In the F habitat frequent recruitment could Occur in `empty patches' resulting from the local and transient elimination of competitors induced by human disturbance.

AB  - The number of fruiting bodies of ectomycorrhizal species in pine forests in The Netherlands has decreased dramatically in recent decades. This decrease has been attributed to an increase in nitrogen deposition and the accumulation of litter and humus. The effects of sod cutting and the removal of litter and humus, to restore ectomycorrhizal diversity in a Scots pine forest in Dwingeloo, The Netherlands, were investigated previously from 1990 to 1993. Removal of the litter and humus resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of species and fruiting bodies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, until now all data were obtained by counting fruiting bodies and the effects on mycelial development below ground were not assessed. To investigate hyphal development, DNA was extracted from bulk soil and polymerase chain reaction products were obtained by amplification using basidiomycete-specific internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers. The differences in diversity between the control plots and the treated plots were analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. To assess the species composition and differences, ITS regions of the amplified fragments were cloned and sequenced. Sequences were compared with sequences from GenBank and from fruiting bodies collected from the same plots. Data indicated increased below-ground ectomycorrhizal diversity in the plots that had been subjected to removal of the litter and humus layers. {\textcopyright} 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB  - Phenology-induced changes in carbon assimilation by trees may affect carbon stored in fine roots and as a consequence, alter carbon allocated to ectomycorrhizal fungi. Two competing models exist to explain carbon mobilization by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Under the ‘saprotrophy model', decreased allocation of carbon may induce saprotrophic behaviour in ectomycorrhizal fungi, resulting in the decomposition of organic matter to mobilize carbon. Alternatively, under the ‘nutrient acquisition model', decomposition may instead be driven by the acquisition of nutrients locked within soil organic matter compounds, with carbon mobilization a secondary process. We tested whether phenology-induced shifts in carbon reserves of fine roots of aspen (Populus tremuloides) affect potential activity of four carbon-compound degrading enzymes, $\beta$-glucuronidase, $\beta$-glucosidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase and laccase, by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Ectomycorrhizal roots from mature aspen were collected across eight stands in north-eastern Alberta, Canada, and analysed during tree dormancy, leaf flush, full leaf expansion and leaf abscission. We predicted potential extracellular enzyme activity to be highest when root carbon reserves were lowest, should host phenology induce saprotrophism. Further, we anticipated enzyme activity to be mediated by invertase, a plant-derived enzyme which makes carbon available to fungal symbionts in the plant–fungus interface. Root carbon reserves were positively correlated with invertase, suggesting phenology may affect carbon allocation to ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, of the four enzymes, host phenology had the largest effect on $\beta$-glucuronidase, but activity of this enzyme was not correlated with root carbon reserves or invertase. Low-biomass ectomycorrhizas had greater potential laccase activity than high-biomass ectomycorrhizas, highlighting discrete functional traits in fungi for litter decomposition. Our results suggest that the decomposition of organic matter may be driven by foraging by fungi for nutrients locked within organic compounds rather than for mobilizing carbon. Furthermore, the potential ability to degrade lignin was more common in low-biomass ectomycorrhizas when compared to high-biomass ectomycorrhizas.

AB  - Are mature forests carbon limited? To explore this question, we exposed ca. 110-year-old, 40-m tall Picea abies trees to a 550-ppm CO2 concentration in a mixed lowland forest in NW Switzerland. The site receives substantial soluble nitrogen (N) via atmospheric deposition, and thus, trees are unlikely N-limited. We used a construction crane to operate the free-air CO2 release system and for canopy access. Here, we summarize the major results for growth and carbon (C) fluxes. Tissue C-13 signals confirmed the effectiveness of the CO2 enrichment system and permitted tracing the continuous flow of new C in trees. Tree responses were individually standardized by pre-treatment signals. Over the five experimental years, needles retained their photosynthetic capacity and absorbed up to 37\% more CO2 under elevated (E) compared to ambient (A) conditions. However, we did not detect an effect on stem radial growth, branch apical growth and needle litter production. Neither stem nor soil CO2 efflux was stimulated under elevated CO2. The rate at which fine roots filled soil ingrowth cores did not significantly differ between A- and E-trees. Since trees showed no stomatal responses to elevated CO2, sap flow remained unresponsive, both in the long run as well as during short-term CO2 on-off experiments. As a consequence, soil moisture remained unaffected. We trapped significantly more nitrate in the root sphere of E-trees suggesting a CO2-stimulated breakdown of soil organic matter, presumably induced by extra carbohydrate exudation (priming').Synthesis. The lack of a single enhanced C sink to match the increased C uptake meant a missing C sink. Increased C transport to below-ground sinks was indicated by C transfer to ectomycorrhiza and on to neighbouring trees and by increased C export to soil. We conclude that these tall Picea abies trees are not C limited at current CO2 concentrations and further atmospheric CO2 enrichment will have at most subtle effects on growth, despite enhanced N availability.

AB  - Increased use of anthropogenically fixed N and the release of N in combustion products have led to concerns about possible long-term impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. Previous studies demonstrating the potential of atmospheric N deposition to influence forest soil carbon have focused on decomposition processes with much less known about potential impacts on mycorrhiza-derived carbon. Glomalin is a unique glycoprotein produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi that has been implicated in the formation of soil aggregates and potentially a significant store of soil carbon. To determine the possible impact of experimental N deposition of such stores we examined the operationally defined glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) levels over two growing seasons in three forest types receiving background N deposition (control) or treated with 80 kg N ha-1 year-1 as NaNO 3. Three sites of each of three forest types, sugar maple-basswood (SMBW), sugar maple-red oak (SMRO), and black oak-white oak (BOWO), in northern Lower Michigan were studied during the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons. GRSP were extracted from air-dried soils with citric acid and measured by the Bradford method. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences related to forest type and sample date in easily extractable Bradford reactive (EE-BRSP) and Bradford-reactive soil protein (BRSP), but failed to detect significant effects of experimental N amendment. EE-BRSP and BRSP varied in a pattern that was consistent with an AM fungal origin; a pattern that reflected the mycorrhizal types of the dominant over and understory plants of each forest ecosystem. SMBW forests dominated by AM plants had the highest levels of protein. BOWO forests with low AM plant cover had the lowest protein levels and SMRO forests were intermediate. Both Bradford-reactive fractions and their ratio varied seasonally, generally being highest in fall samples. Significant correlations observed between BRSP fractions, phosphorous, and soil organic matter were likely related to covariation of soil properties across forest types. While not statistically significant, response patterns of BRSP to N deposition were ecosystem-specific and reflected mycorrhizal types of dominant species. Abundance of these proteins reflected previously observed changes in SOC in the two forest types examined with abundant AM hosts. Specifically, nitrate addition led to BRSP decreases in SMBW and increases in SMRO forests. Changes in BRSP accounted for a small fraction of the changes in SOC; appearing to increase as a fraction of residual SOC consistent with the idea that GRSP are recalcitrant. BRSP remained unchanged at BOWO sites despite a significant increase in SOC at these sites. Our results point to the potential of proteins as contributors to differential, mycorrhizal type-specific responses to changes in soil carbon following N amendment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Fine root production and turnover were studied in hardwood and coniferous taiga forests using three methods. (1) Using soil cores, fine root production ranged from 1574 ± 76 kg {\textperiodcentered} ha-1 {\textperiodcentered} year-1 in the upland white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) stand to 4386 ± 322 kg {\textperiodcentered} ha-1 {\textperiodcentered} year-1 in the floodplain balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.) stand, accounting for 49% of total production for coniferous stands anti 32% of total production for deciduous stands. Fine root turnover rates were higher in floodplain (0.90 ± 0.06 year-1) stands than in upland (0.42 ± 0.10 year-1) stands. Across all sites, the ratio of fine root turnover to litter fall averaged 2.2 for biomass and 2.8 for N. Both values were higher in floodplain stands than in upland stands, and in coniferous stands than in deciduous stands. (2) The C budget method showed that C allocation to fine roots varied from 150 to 425 g C {\textperiodcentered} m-2 {\textperiodcentered} year-1 and suggested that soil respiration was more dependent on C derived from reels than from aboveground inputs. The C allocation ratio (C to roots: C to litter fall) was inversely correlated with litter-fall C and varied from 0.3 to 69.5; there was a tendency for higher proportional belowground allocation in coniferous stands than in deciduous stands and the highest levels were at the earliest successional sites. (3) Estimates of apparent N uptake (N(u)), N allocation to fine roots, and fine root production based on N budget calculations showed that annual aboveground N increments exceeded N(u) estimates at half the sites, indicating that the method failed to account for large amounts of N acquired by plants. This suggests that plant and (or) mycorrhizal uptake of soil organic N may be more significant to ecosystem N cycling than mineral N turnover by the soil microbial biomass.

AB  - Decomposition is a key component of the global carbon (C) cycle, yet current ecosystem C models do not adequately represent the contributions of plant roots and their mycorrhizae to this process. The understanding of decomposition dynamics and their control by traits is particularly limited for the most distal first-order roots. Here we followed decomposition of first-order roots and leaf litter from 35 woody plant species differing in mycorrhizal type over 6 years in a Chinese temperate forest. First-order roots decomposed more slowly (k = 0.11 ± 0.01 years−1) than did leaf litter (0.35 ± 0.02 years−1), losing only 35% of initial mass on average after 6 years of exposure in the field. In contrast to leaf litter, nonlignin root C chemistry (nonstructural carbohydrates, polyphenols) accounted for 82% of the large interspecific variation in first-order root decomposition. Leaf litter from ectomycorrhizal (EM) species decomposed more slowly than that from arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) species, whereas first-order roots of EM species switched, after 2 years, from having slower to faster decomposition compared with those from AM species. The fundamentally different dynamics and control mechanisms of first-order root decomposition compared with those of leaf litter challenge current ecosystem C models, the recently suggested dichotomy between EM and AM plants, and the idea that common traits can predict decomposition across roots and leaves. Aspects of C chemistry unrelated to lignin or nitrogen, and not presently considered in decomposition models, controlled first-order root decomposition; thus, current paradigms of ecosystem C dynamics and model pa-rameterization require revision. {\textcopyright} 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Improved understanding of the nutritional ecology of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is important in understanding how tropical forests maintain high productivity on low-fertility soils. Relatively little is known about how AM fungi will respond to changes in nutrient inputs in tropical forests, which hampers our ability to assess how forest productivity will be influenced by anthropogenic change. Here we assessed the influence of long-term inorganic and organic nutrient additions and nutrient depletion on AM fungi, using two adjacent experiments in a lowland tropical forest in Panama. We characterised AM fungal communities in soil and roots using 454-pyrosequencing, and quantified AM fungal abundance using microscopy and a lipid biomarker. Phosphorus and nitrogen addition reduced the abundance of AM fungi to a similar extent, but affected community composition in different ways. Nutrient depletion (removal of leaf litter) had a pronounced effect on AM fungal community composition, affecting nearly as many OTUs as phosphorus addition. The addition of nutrients in organic form (leaf litter) had little effect on any AM fungal parameter. Soil AM fungal communities responded more strongly to changes in nutrient availability than communities in roots. This suggests that the ‘dual niches' of AM fungi in soil versus roots are structured to different degrees by abiotic environmental filters, and biotic filters imposed by the plant host. Our findings indicate that AM fungal communities are fine-tuned to nutrient regimes, and support future studies aiming to link AM fungal community dynamics with ecosystem function. {\textcopyright} 2018, International Society for Microbial Ecology.

AB  - Saprotrophic fungi are the dominant producers of organic matter-degrading extracellular enzymes in forest soils, but the extent to which they drive spatio-temporal variation in enzyme activities is unclear. We quantified the relationships between saprotrophic fungal biomass and enzyme activities in a mature temperate hardwood forest by placing soil-filled ingrowth bags inside trenches. Trenches were located in replicate stands (n = 7) dominated by either arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)- or ectomycorrhizal (ECM)-associated tree species, which reflect differences in soil substrate quality and nutrient availability. Additionally, we assessed the extent to which the relationships between saprotrophic fungal biomass and enzyme activities varied across seasons and were altered by experimental nitrogen (N) addition. Overall, both fungal production and enzyme activities differed between mycorrhizal types and across seasons, but were unaffected by N addition. Additionally, enzyme activities exhibited strong, positive relationships with saprotrophic fungal biomass. However, the relative production of carbon (C)-degrading enzymes was greater in stands dominated by AM-associated trees in the late growing season, and the relative production of N-degrading enzymes was greater in the late growing season across both AM- and ECM-dominated forest stands. These patterns reflected tree- and season-driven changes in microbial C and N limitation. As such, while the common assumption that microbial biomass and enzyme activities are positively correlated is robust for saprotrophic fungi, enzyme produced per unit biomass may not be consistent among stands and across seasons. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bark beetle outbreaks are widespread in western North American forests, reducing primary productivity and transpiration, leading to forest mortality across large areas and altering ecosystem carbon cycling. Here the carbon isotope composition ($\delta$13C) of soil respiration ($\delta$J) was monitored in the decade after disturbance for forests affected naturally by mountain pine beetle infestation and artificially by stem girdling. The seasonal mean $\delta$J changed along both chronosequences. We found (a) enrichment of $\delta$J relative to controls (<1 ‰) in near-surface soils in the first 2 years after disturbance; (b) depletion (1‰ or no change) during years 3–7; and (c) a second period of enrichment (1–2‰) in years 8–10. Results were consistent with isotopic patterns associated with the gradual death and decomposition of rhizosphere organisms, fine roots, conifer needles and woody roots and debris over the course of a decade after mortality. Finally, $\delta$J was progressively more 13C-depleted deeper in the soil than near the surface, while the bulk soil followed the well-established pattern of 13C-enrichment at depth. Overall, differences in $\delta$J between mortality classes (<1‰) and soil depths (<3‰) were smaller than variability within a class or depth over a season (up to 6‰). {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Microorganisms have critical roles in the functioning of soil in nutrient cycling, structural formation, and plant interactions, both positive and negative. These roles are important in reestablishing function and biodiversity in ecosystem restoration. Measurement of the community indicates the status of the system in relation to restoration targets and the effectiveness of management interventions, and manipulation of the community shows promise in the enhancement of the rate of recovery of degraded systems.

AB  - Upland oak forests in the ecotone between the eastern deciduous forest and the southern Great Plains are threatened by encroachment of eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) due to fire suppression. The rapid rate of encroachment caused concern about concomitant alterations of site characteristics including nutrient cycling and the soil microbial communities (SMC) that could lead to positive feedbacks reinforcing eastern redcedar encroachment. We studied eight upland oak forests across central and western Oklahoma with stands representing three levels of encroachment: oak-dominated, eastern redcedar-dominated, and an intermediate mixture of both species. We analyzed litter chemistry (carbon, lignin, and nitrogen), soil chemistry (soil organic matter, NH4N, NO3-N, PO4, K, and pH), and profiled soil microbial communities using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA). Eastern redcedar encroachment was accompanied by reduced litter carbon along with higher levels of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi while litter N was lower in mixed stands. However, we detected no change in soil chemistry. Our results indicate eastern redcedar encroachment in these upland oak forests reduced litter quality and altered the SMC through increases in AM fungi, a symbiont associated with eastern redcedar. These alterations may create positive soil-microbial feedbacks by reducing the fitness of the dominant oak species and facilitating rapid increase in eastern redcedar in this threatened, oak-dominated ecosystem.

AB  - Forest management practices often severely affect forest ecosystem functioning. Tree removal by clearcutting is one such practice, producing severe impacts due to the total reduction of primary productivity. Here, we assessed changes to fungal community structure and decomposition activity in the soil, roots and rhizosphere of a Picea abies stand for a 2-year period following clearcutting compared to data from before tree harvest. We found that the termination of photosynthate flow through tree roots into soil is associated with profound changes in soil, both in decomposition processes and fungal community composition. The rhizosphere, representing an active compartment of high enzyme activity and high fungal biomass in the living stand, ceases to exist and starts to resemble bulk soil. Decomposing roots appear to separate from bulk soil and develop into hotspots of decomposition and important fungal biomass pools. We found no support for the involvement of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the decomposition of roots, but we found some evidence that root endophytic fungi may have an important role in the early stages of this process. In soil, activity of extracellular enzymes also decreased in the long term following the end of rhizodeposition by tree roots. {\textcopyright} 2017 International Society for Microbial Ecology.

AB  - Meadows are natural dynamic features of forested mountain landscapes of the Pacific Northwest. Proportions of meadows and forests change with environmental conditions and disturbance history. We investigated the belowground microbial communities associated with these two vegetation types and how they change across the meadow-forest transition at two sites in Oregon. Soils were sampled along replicate transects extending from meadow into forest. We quantified total bacterial and fungal biomass using direct microscopy and described the composition of bacterial and fungal communities using a DNA-based fingerprinting technique. Bacterial biomass was similar in meadow and forest soils, but fungal biomass was significantly higher in forest soil. Meadow and forest soils had distinct communities of bacteria and fungi. Bacterial communities near the meadow-forest boundary reflected current vegetation, but fungal communities under meadow vegetation near the forest edge were intermediate in composition between those found in meadow and forest soils. The more gradual transition observed with fungal communities may reflect the influence of tree roots and their associated ectomycorrhizal fungi or possibly colonization by saprotrophic fungi associated with tree litter accumulating near the forest edge. Invasion of forest-associated fungi into the meadow soils may presage subsequent expansion of forest vegetation into meadows. {\textcopyright} 2008 NRC.

Carex heliophila, a nonmycorrhizal plant, was virtually the only species present beneath live ponderosa pines. The authors examined the extent to which vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) colonized understory plants on both live and beetle-killed pine sites; the availability of live- and killed-pine soil VAM inoculum in situ and in the laboratory; the abundance of VAM spores in field soils; and the possible inhibition of VAM formation by forest floor decomposition products in live-pine soils. -from Authors

AB  - Given the current gap in knowledge concerning the macrofungal diversity of holm-oak forests at the northern limit of their distribution range and in the Basque Country, a mycocoenological study was conducted by sampling 23 randomly selected permanent plots from 6 holm-oak forests. To obtain a better understanding of the macrofungal diversity distribution pattern on a regional scale, forests from both the temperate and Mediterranean-type climate regions of the Basque Country were selected, covering all their phytocoenological variation. After 4 years of sampling, a total of 377 macrofungal species were collected: 209 ectomycorrhizal species, 86 humicolous saprotrophs, 40 saprotrophs on litter, 36 lignicolous saprotrophs, 3 coprophilous saprotrophs and 3 parasitic species. Species considered characteristic of this kind of forest, such as Cortinarius aurilicis, Cortinarius callochrous, Cortinarius ionochlorus, Hygrophorus leucophaeo-ilicis, Hygrophorus persoonii, Hygrophorus russula, Lactarius atlanticus, Lactarius ilicis, Leccinellum lepidum, were recorded all over the territory, but Mediterranean forests were richer in species and more productive in sporocarps than temperate ones. Species assemblage was found to change gradually at local scale from temperate to Mediterranean climate zones, and was distinct to each phytocoenological association with all species, with ectomycorrhizal species and with saprotrophs. {\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Deconvoluting the relative contributions made by specific biotic and abiotic drivers to soil fungal community compositions facilitates predictions about the functional responses of ecosystems to environmental changes, such as losses of plant diversity, but it is hindered by the complex interactions involved. Experimental assembly of tree species allows separation of the respective effects of plant community composition (biotic components) and soil properties (abiotic components), enabling much greater statistical power than can be achieved in observational studies. We therefore analyzed these contributions by assessing, via pyrotag sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) rDNA region, fungal communities in young subtropical forest plots included in a large experiment on the effects of tree species richness. Spatial variables and soil properties were the main drivers of soil fungal alpha and beta-diversity, implying strong early-stage environmental filtering and dispersal limitation. Tree related variables, such as tree community composition, significantly affected arbuscular mycorrhizal and pathogen fungal community structure, while differences in tree host species and host abundance affected ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition. At this early stage of the experiment, only a limited amount of carbon inputs (rhizodeposits and leaf litter) was being provided to the ecosystem due to the size of the tree saplings, and persisting legacy effects were observed. We thus expect to find increasing tree related effects on fungal community composition as forest development proceeds. {\textcopyright} 2018 Wei{\ss}becker, Wubet, Lentendu, K{\"{u}}hn, Scholten, Bruelheide and Buscot.

AB  - Mushroom fruiting, the reproduction of fungi, has broad implications for forest health, terrestrial biomass turnover, and global carbon cycle. However, little is known about the difference in phenology and environmental drivers of mushroom fruiting between functional guilds, e.g., ectomycorrhizal (ECM) mutualists and saprotrophs (SAP). There is a remarkable difference between ECM and SAP fungi in their available carbon sources and lifecycles, and thus these fungal groups are likely to differ in fruiting phenology. We analyzed intra- and inter-annual phenological patterns of mushroom fruiting throughout the year using a long-term census dataset of mushroom-forming fungi in a Japanese oak forest in which a total of 11,923 mushroom counts (668 species) were recorded during monthly intervals from 1982 to 2011. ECM fungi showed a unimodal seasonal fruiting peak from mid-summer to early autumn; litter-decomposing fungi showed moderate fruiting peaks from early summer or early autumn, and the phenology of wood-decomposing fungi varied considerably among the genera. Each functional group was controlled by a different set of external factors; temperature and rainfall increased ECM fungal fruiting, but key factors substantially differed among the genera of litter- and wood-decomposing fungi in taxon-specific ways. Our results suggest that fungal fruiting phenology may be affected by the seasonality of carbohydrate availability. The highly scheduled reproduction of ECM fungi may reflect temperature-dependent increases and drought-induced decreases of photosynthetic activity in host plants rather than improved growth conditions for fungi during the summer. We argue that the way a fungus obtains carbohydrates may explain a substantial fraction of the fruiting phenology, which may make a differential contribution to the community structure of fungus-associated organisms and terrestrial biomass turnover based on fungal functional groups. {\textcopyright} 2012 Sato et al.

AB  - In forest ecosystems, fungal mats are functionally important in nutrient and water uptake in litter and wood decomposition processes, in carbon resource allocation, soil weathering and in cycling of soil resources. Fungal mats can occur abundantly in forests and are widely distributed globally. We sampled ponderosa pine/white fir and mountain hemlock/noble fir communities at Crater Lake National Park for mat-forming soil fungi. Fungus collections were identified by DNA sequencing. Thirty-eight mat-forming genotypes were identified; members of the five most common genera (Gautieria, Lepiota, Piloderma, Ramaria, and Rhizopogon) comprised 67% of all collections. The mycorrhizal genera Alpova and Lactarius are newly identified as ectomycorrhizal mat-forming taxa, as are the saprotrophic genera Flavoscypha, Gastropila, Lepiota and Xenasmatella. Twelve typical mat forms are illustrated, representing both ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi that were found. Abundance of fungal mats was correlated with higher soil carbon to nitrogen ratios, fine woody debris and needle litter mass in both forest ecotypes. Definitions of fungal mats are discussed, along with some of the challenges in defining what comprises a fungal "mat". {\textcopyright} 2012 by the authors.

AB  - In forest ecosystems, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are important for plant growth and soil biogeochemical processes. The biochemical composition of ECM mycelium is an important fungal effect trait with consequences for its decomposition rate, and consequently on soil carbon pools and plant nutrition. Although the link between ECM fungi and leaf litter–released nutrients is well known, the response of ECM fungal biochemical composition to different leaf litter species remains poorly understood. To determine how leaf litter quality influences ECM fungi's biochemical profiles, we planted young beech trees in an oak forest and replaced the natural leaf litter with that of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), or lime (Tilia cordata). We assessed the biochemical profiles of ECM root tips colonized by common fungal taxa in temperate forests (i.e., Cenococcum geophilum, Inocybe sp., and Lactarius subdulcis), using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). ECM fungal biochemical composition changed with leaf litter species. Changes were apparent in the infrared absorption bands assigned to functional groups of lipids, amides, and carbohydrates. C. geophilum and L. subdulcis exhibited large spectral differences corresponding to the initial pattern of leaf litter chemical composition between samples collected in the beech and ash leaf litter treatments. In contrast, Inocybe sp. was influenced by lime, but with no differences between samples from ash or beech leaf litter treatments. Although the spectral bands affected by leaf litter type differed among ECM fungi, they were mainly related to amides, indicating a dynamic response of the fungal proteome to soil nutritional changes. Overall, the results indicate that the biochemical response of ECM fungi to leaf litter species varies among ECM fungal species and suggests that the biochemical composition of ECM mycelium is a fungal response trait, sensitive to environmental changes such as shifts in leaf litter species. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Plant roots and the associated mycorrhizal fungal hyphae often selectively proliferate into patchily distributed soil nutrient hotspots, but interactions between these two components of a mycorrhizal root system are usually ignored or experimentally isolated in nutrient foraging studies. From studies in which both roots and mycorrhizal hyphae had access to nutrient hotspots, we compiled data on root foraging precision (increase in roots in nutrient hotspots relative to outside hotspots) of plant species from different ecosystems, ranging from temperate grasslands to subtropical forests. We found that root foraging precision across the wide range of plant species was strongly influenced by root morphology and mycorrhizal type. The precision of root nutrient foraging, as a plant functional trait, may coordinate with other root traits that are related to the economics of nutrient acquisition. High foraging precision is expected to associate with the strategy of fast return on the investment in roots, such as low construction cost, high metabolic rate and rapid turnover. Nutrient foraging by mycorrhizal fungi alone may be influenced by functional traits such as hyphal exploration distance, hyphal turnover, and hyphal uptake capacity and efficiency, but such data are limited to a small portion of mycorrhizal fungal species. We propose a conceptual framework in which to simulate nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition from both nutrient hotspots and outside hotspots in mixed-species plant communities. Simulation outputs suggest that plant species with varying root morphology and mycorrhizal type can be adaptive to a range of nutrient heterogeneity. Although there are still knowledge gaps related to nutrient foraging, as well as many unexplored plant and fungal species, we suggest that scaling nutrient foraging from individual plants to communities would advance understanding of plant species interactions and below-ground ecosystem function.

AB  - We used a novel digital autoradiographic technique that enabled, for the first time, simultaneous visualization and quantification of spatial and temporal changes in carbon allocation patterns in ectomycorrhizal mycelia. Mycorrhizal plants of Pinus sylvestris L. were grown in microcosms containing non-sterile peat. The time course and spatial distribution of carbon allocation by Fl sylvestris to mycelia of its mycorrhizal partners, Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr. and Suillus bovinus (L.): Kuntze, were quantified following C-14 pulse labeling of the plants. Litter patches were used to investigate the effects of nutrient resource quality on carbon allocation. The wood-decomposer fungus Phanerochaete velutina (D.C.: Pers.) Parmasto was introduced to evaluate competitive and territorial interactions between its mycelial cords and the mycelial system of S. bovinus. Growth of ectomycorrhizal mycelium was stimulated in the litter patches. Nearly 60\% of the C transferred from host plant to external mycorrhizal mycelium (> 2 mm from root surfaces) was allocated to mycelium in the patches, which comprised only 12\% of the soil area available for mycelial colonization. Mycelia in the litter patch most recently colonized by mycorrhizal mycelium received the largest investment of carbon, amounting to 27 to 50\% of the total C-14 in external mycorrhizal mycelium. The amount of C transfer to external mycelium of S. bovinus following pulse labeling was reduced from a maximum of 167 nmol in systems with no saprotroph to a maximum of 61 nmol in systems interacting with P. velutina. The C-14 content of S. bovinus mycelium reached a maximum 24-36 h after labeling in control microcosms, but allocation did not reach a peak until 56 h after labeling, when S, bovinus interacted with mycelium of fl velutina. The mycelium of S. bovinus contained 9\% of the total C-14 in the plants (including mycorrhizae) at the end of the experiment, but this was reduced to 4\% in the presence of P. velutina. The results demonstrate the dynamic manner in which mycorrhizal mycelia deploy C when foraging for nutrients. The inhibitory effect of the wood-decomposer fungus P. velutina on C allocation to external mycorrhizal mycelium has important implications for nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.

AB  - Many studies have shown the importance of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EM) in forests both for nutrient availability and for carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in the soil. Yet so far they are not incorporated in forest ecosystem growth and yield models. Recent research suggests phosphorus (P) shortage could be a major constraints to forest productivity in the future. For a realistic simulation of future forest ecosystem functioning, inclusion of detailed soil P cycling and the trees-EM interaction is necessary. We developed a full ecosystem P model that simulates P uptake by roots and EM, allocation within trees, physiological deficiency effects on C assimilation and allocation, release through litter decomposition, coupled with water, C and nitrogen (N) fluxes accounted for in the mechanistic forest stand model ANAFORE. Our results confirm the importance of incorporating EM in forest ecosystem models and suggest that the lack of incorporation of P in models may result in an under- or overestimation of forest growth. This new model has the potential of being used to assess the response of trees and/or stands to nutrient availability under different climate and management scenarios. With the current parameterization it is functional as a scientific research tool to investigate hypotheses. {\textcopyright} 2018 Michiel F. Bortier et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2018.

AB  - Aims: Tropical tree and lianas in the understory are limited by soil nutrients despite growing in extremely low light. It is not known if nomadic vines are also limited by nutrients in low light conditions. Methods: We measured differences in root architecture and mycorrhizal colonization, and leaf nutrients of a nomadic vine, Philodendron fragrantissimum (Araceae), in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization plots in a lowland tropical moist forest in central Panama to measure potential nutrient limitation. Results: Relative to plants in control plots, leaf P concentration was 54% higher and leaf N concentration was 10% higher for plants in the P- and N-addition treatments, respectively. The N:P of leaves suggested P-limitation in the N-addition treatment and the control but not in the P-addition treatment. Root branching was highest in the P-addition treatment, and P-addition reduced mycorrhizal colonization. Conclusions: The large effect of P fertilization suggests that, like many tropical plants, P. fragrantissimum has the potential to be P-limited. Although further study is needed, we suggest that nomadic vines be added to the growth forms that respond to nutrient addition in the forest understory and conclude that nutrient-limitation seems like the rule rather than the exception in the light-limited understory. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi are ubiquitous in temperate and boreal forests, comprising over 20,000 species forming root symbiotic associations with Pinaceae and woody angiosperms. As much as 100 different EM fungal species can coexist and interact with the same tree species, forming complex multispecies networks in soils. The degree of host specificity and structural properties of these interaction networks (e.g., nestedness and modularity) may influence plant and fungal community assembly and species coexistence, yet their structure has been little studied in northern coniferous forests, where trees depend on EM fungi for nutrient acquisition. We used high-throughput sequencing to characterize the composition and diversity of bulk soil and root-associated fungal communities in four co-occurring Pinaceae in a relic foredune plain located at {\^{I}}les de la Madeleine, Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. We found high EM fungal richness across the four hosts, with a total of 200 EM operational taxonomic units (OTUs), mainly belonging to the Agaricomycetes. Network analysis revealed an antinested pattern in both bulk soil and roots EM fungal communities. However, there was no detectable modularity (i.e., subgroups of interacting species) in the interaction networks, indicating a low level of specificity in these EM associations. In addition, there were no differences in EM fungal OTU richness or community structure among the four tree species. Limited shared resources and competitive exclusion typically restrict the number of taxa coexisting within the same niche. As such, our finding of high EM fungal richness and low host specificity highlights the need for further studies to determine the mechanisms enabling such a large number of EM fungal species to coexist locally on the same hosts. {\textcopyright} 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Large amounts of freshly fixed carbon in forest ecosystems are allocated belowground and fuel soil food webs. This supply is usually generalized as the `root carbon', but particular pathways by which freshly fixed carbon is assimilated by soil animals remain poorly understood. We followed the appearance of the isotopic label in springtails inhabiting different layers of soil and litter (euedaphic, hemiedaphic and epigeic life forms) after in situ pulse-labelling of spruce trees with C-13-O-2. Isotopic label was most frequently observed in euedaphic Collembola (26\% of all samples), mainly in Protaphorura armata. The label was very rare in litter-dwelling (hemiedaphic) species (4\%). Surprisingly, the label was often observed in epigeic Collembola (11\%). During the period of 44 days after labelling, the proportion of labelled samples increased with time in euedaphic, but not in epigeic species, suggesting that freshly fixed carbon is assimilated by these collembolan groups via different pathways. Most likely, euedaphic species are trophically linked to plant roots, whereas epigeic species receive freshly fixed carbon from aboveground. The exact mechanisms and potential importance of the latter pathway should be evaluated in further research. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bacterial communities and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) co-occur in the soil, however, the interaction between these two groups during litter decomposition remains largely unexplored. In order to investigate the effect of AMF on soil bacterial communities, we designed dual compartment microcosms, where AMF (Funneliformis mosseae) was allowed access (AM) to, or excluded (NM) from, a compartment containing forest soil and litterbags. Soil samples from this compartment were analyzed at 0, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days. For each sample, Illumina sequencing was used to assess any changes in the soil bacterial communities. We found that most of the obtained operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from both treatments belonged to the phylum of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria. The community composition of bacteria at phylum and class levels was slightly influenced by both time and AMF. In addition, time and AMF significantly affected bacterial genera (e.g., Candidatus Solibacter, Dyella, Phenylobacterium) involved in litter decomposition. Opposite to the bacterial community composition, we found that overall soil bacterial OTU richness and diversity are relatively stable and were not significantly influenced by either time or AMF inoculation. OTU richness at phylum and class levels also showed consistent results with overall bacterial OTU richness. Our study provides new insight into the influence of AMF on soil bacterial communities at the genus level. {\textcopyright} 2017 Gui, Purahong, Hyde, Xu and Mortimer.

AB  - Mycoheterotrophic plants (MHPs) are leafless, achlorophyllous, and completely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for their carbon supply. Mycorrhizal symbiosis is a mutualistic association with fungi that is undertaken by the majority of land plants, but mycoheterotrophy represents a breakdown of this mutualism in that plants parasitize fungi. Most MHPs are associated with fungi that are mycorrhizal with autotrophic plants, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Although these MHPs gain carbon via the common mycorrhizal network that links the surrounding autotrophic plants, some mycoheterotrophic lineages are associated with saprotrophic (SAP) fungi, which are free-living and decompose leaf litter and wood materials. Such MHPs are dependent on the forest carbon cycle, which involves the decomposition of wood debris and leaf litter, and have a unique biology and evolutionary history. MHPs associated with SAP fungi (SAP-MHPs) have to date been found only in the Orchidaceae and likely evolved independently at least nine times within that family. Phylogenetically divergent SAP Basidiomycota, mostly Agaricales but also Hymenochaetales, Polyporales, and others, are involved in mycoheterotrophy. The fungal specificity of SAP-MHPs varies from a highly specific association with a single fungal species to a broad range of interactions with multiple fungal orders. Establishment of symbiotic culture systems is indispensable for understanding the mechanisms underlying plant–fungus interactions and the conservation of MHPs. Symbiotic culture systems have been established for many SAP-MHP species as a pure culture of free-living SAP fungi is easier than that of biotrophic AM or ECM fungi. Culturable SAP-MHPs are useful research materials and will contribute to the advancement of plant science. {\textcopyright} 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - • The extramatrical mycelia (EMM) of ectomycorrhizal fungi make up a large proportion of the microbial diversity and biomass in temperate forest soils. Thus, their response to elevated CO2 can have large effects on plant nutrient acquisition and carbon movement through forests. • Here, the effects of CO2 and nitrogen (N) fertilization on EMM biomass and community structure in Pinus taeda forest plots were examined using sand-filled mesh bags buried in the field, the contents of which were analyzed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and DNA sequencing. • A total of 2138 sequences comprising 295 taxa were recovered; most (83.5%) were from ectomycorrhizal fungal taxa. No biomass increase was detected in elevated CO2 plots relative to control plots, but individual taxa responded to both CO2 and N fertilization, four of the six most abundant taxa were less frequent in N-fertilized plots. Thelephoroid and athelioid taxa were both frequent and abundant as EMM, and thelephoroid richness was extremely high. Russula and Cortinariaceae taxa were less abundant and boletoid taxa were more abundant as EMM relative to ectomycorrhizas. • The EMM community, sampled across seasons and years, was dynamic with a high degree of interspecific variation in response to CO2 enrichment and N fertilization. {\textcopyright} The Authors (2007).

AB  - In many ecosystems, browsing of large mammals can affect plant species compositions. However, much less is known about potential above- and below-ground trophic interactions of large browsing mammals. This study focused on the direct and indirect effects of browsing on trophic and abiotic interactions within forest ecosystems. To quantify above- and below-ground cascade effects, white-tailed deer have been excluded for over 18 years from three 4-ha plots, which were paired with same sized deer access plots. Our results demonstrate complex direct and indirect cascade effects on forest food webs. Deer exclusion directly altered woody species composition and significantly increased shrub and sapling density. Above-ground cascade effects include greater leaf litter accumulation and higher arthropod density and biomass within the exclosures. Below-ground indirect effects include significant decrease in soil nutrients, and higher arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculum potential in the exclosures. Because ecosystems have finite resource availability, high deer density may imbalance the system by redirecting resources toward maintaining deer biomass at the expense of multiple trophic levels throughout the forest community. Both complex bottom up and top down trophic cascade effects demonstrated largely unidirectional negative responses suggesting that high deer density has reduced the biodiversity of the forest community.

AB  - Macrofungal assemblages of Sitka spruce and Scots pine plantations in northern Britain were compared to those of semi-natural pine and oak woodlands, with a focus on threatened pinewood taxa. Fungal species-richness and species-composition were related to climate, soil, vegetation and stand variables across a range of crop stages. Altogether, 419 species were recorded (12 parasites, 76 wood saprotrophs, 174 mycorrhizal species, 157 litter saprotrophs). There were no differences in fungal species-richness between plantations and semi-natural woodlands nor any effects of crop species age or type. Significant positive correlations were recorded between fungal species-richness and ground vegetation diversity, and between wood saprotroph-richness and fallen deadwood volume. Each crop species type had a distinctive mycota related to differences in climate, tree and vegetation diversity. Over-mature stands had a higher proportion of ``late-successional{''} mycorrhizal species than the other growth stages. Nineteen Red Data list fungi species were recorded; plots nearer to semi-natural pinewood areas had a higher number of species records. These results highlight the importance of planted forests as a habitat for native fungi. Habitat value could be further enhanced through increasing the area of ``old-growth{''} non-intervention reserves, and locating these reserves near existing semi-natural woodland fragments.

AB  - This survey of the spore germination requirements in the Hymenomycetes and the Gasteromycetes shows that saprophytes as xylophiles, which decompose wood and forest litter, and coprophiles, which live on dung, usually germinate easily even on simple nutrient media. Species forming ectomycorrhiza with trees or living as parasites require as a rule more particular conditions for germination. In the mycorrhiza-formers, chiefly agarics and boleti, germination can often be induced by exudates from tree roots or certain yeasts, in species of Leccinum by exudate from self mycelium. The heartrot fungi, chiefly those species of Aphyllophorales which are parasites on trees, germinate preferably when exposed to an increased CO2 content in the air or to exudates of certain micro-organisms. In many praticolous fungi, which are supposed to parasitize roots of grasses and herbs, germination is stimulated by various yeasts. The possibility of interpreting these particular germination conditions as adaptations to a parasitic or symbiotic life is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1984 Indian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - In the context of forestry, the concept of allelopathy has recently been expanded from a plant to plant interference phenomenon to an ecosystem-level phenomenon that is influenced by ecosystem disturbance. This chapter reviews the latest development in our understanding of forest allelopathy and the ways in which this new knowledge can be used in sustainable forest management. Allelopathic effects of certain canopy trees on tree seedlings and understory plants have direct effects on forest renewal. Likewise some understory plants with allelopathic property can have controlling effects on tree regeneration and species composition. In fire adapted boreal forests, particularly natural fires, the level and distribution of fire severity plays a critical role in the manifestation of forest allelopathy. The high severity fires break down allelochemicals by thermal decomposition, create favorable seedbed by consuming forest floor humus and releasing nutrients and removing competing plants by killing underground regenerating organs. Clearcut harvesting and low-severity fires on the other hand, may promote vegetative regeneration of understory plants with competitive and allelopathic properties as their underground perennating structures remain unharmed. This may cause retrogressive succession by resisting tree colonization and inducing long-term habitat degradation. Research in the last two decades has increased our understanding on the mechanism of forest allelopathy in fire adapted boreal forests, but our knowledge in forest allelopathy in tropical forest is very limited. Control of competing and allelopathic plants after forest harvesting is a serious issue in forestry and public opinion is not favorable in using chemical herbicides. Alternative methods such as use of allelopathic straw mulch, herbicides of biological origin (bialaphose), planting tree seedling pre-inoculated with mycorrhiza, and scarification and spot fertilization at planting have produced good results. It is possible to develop alternative methods of weed control in forestry by using allelopathy principle. However, substantial infusion of research and development funds is necessary to make significant progress in this area. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media LLC.

AB  - Aims: Changes in plant net primary production due to climate change can influence aboveground and belowground litter inputs to forest soils. We aim to examine the effects of such changes on soil carbon in subtropical forest ecosystems where these effects have not been thoroughly investigated. Methods: We manipulated aboveground litter inputs and excluded roots in a factorial design, and measured the effects of each treatment and their interactions on soil carbon (C) and soil microbial community structure. Results: After only 3 years of treatment, aboveground litter addition and root exclusion respectively caused 9% and 21% reductions in soil C concentration in the 0–10 cm soil, likely through different mechanisms. The reduction of soil C with aboveground litter addition was attributed to a priming effect, while reduced root-derived C inputs were likely the cause of the C reduction associated with root exclusion. PLFA analysis showed that both aboveground and belowground litter manipulations reduced Gram-positive bacteria biomass (by 30%–58%) compare to the control, but only root exclusion significantly reduced the actinobacteria biomarkers (by 46%–58%). Fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and ratios of Gram-negative to Gram-positive bacteria and bacteria to fungi did not differ among treatments. Conclusion: Our results show that root-derived C inputs exert a stronger control on soil C concentrations and microbial community structures than aboveground litter does in subtropical natural forest soils. Our study also highlights that that both increases in aboveground litter and decreases in belowground C input to soil can lead to reduced soil C. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The hypothesis proposed by Gadgil and Gadgil (1971) that mycorrhizal tree roots suppress the decomposition of forest litter was examined in trenching experiments. The tests were conducted in two beech forest sites in southern Sweden, one with mor and one with mull. The exclusion of tree roots had no apparent influence on litter mass loss at any of the sites, which differed markedly in soil fertility and root distribution. Nor did trenching have any significant effect on total organic matter over the following 6 years, although trenched plots tended to be wetter than undisturbed soil. The present results as well as results from other similar studies suggest that the suppression of litter turnover by mycorrhizal tree roots is not an important mechanism in northern temperate and boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 1988 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are an important class of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environment and accumulate in forest soils. These soils are often dominated by ectomycorrhizal (EcM) roots, but little is known about how EcM fungi degrade PAHs, or the overall effect of field colonized EcM roots on the fate of PAHs. The ability of eight EcM fungi to degrade PAHs in liquid culture spiked with 14C labelled PAHs was investigated. Microcosms were used to determine the impact of naturally colonized mycorrhizal pine seedlings on PAH mineralization and volatilization. Only two EcM fungi (Thelephora terrestris and Laccaria laccata) degraded at least one PAH and none were able to mineralize the PAHs in pure culture. Where degradation occurred, the compounds were only mono-oxygenated. EcM pine seedlings did not alter naphthalene mineralization or volatilization but retarded fluorene mineralization by 35% compared with unplanted, ectomycorrhizosphere soil inoculated, microcosms. The EcM fungi possessed limited PAH degrading abilities, which may explain why EcM dominated microcosms retarded fluorene mineralization. This observation is considered in relation to the 'Gadgil-effect', where retarded litter decomposition has been observed in the presence of EcM roots. {\textcopyright} New Phytologist (2004).

AB  - Development of extraradical mycelia of two strains each of Paxillus involutus and Suillus bovinus in ectomycorrhizal association with Pinus sylvestris seedlings was studied in two dimensions in non-sterile soil microcosms. There were significant inter- and intra-specific differences in extraradical mycelial growth and morphology. The mycelial systems of both strains of P. involutus were diffuse and extended more rapidly than those of S. bovinus. Depending on the strain, P. involutus mycelia were either highly plane filled, with high mass fractal dimension (a measure of space filling) or sparse, low mass fractal dimension systems. Older mycelial systems persisted as linear cords interlinking ectomycorrhizal tips. S. bovinus produced either a mycelium with a mixture of mycelial cords and diffuse fans that rapidly filled explorable area, or a predominately corded mycelium of minimal area cover. In the soil microcosms, mass fractal dimension and mycelial cover tended to increase with time, mycelia encountering litter having significantly greater values. Results are discussed in terms of the ecology of these fungi, their foraging activities and functional importance in forest ecosystems.

AB  - Tropical montane forests (TMF) are associated with a widely observed suite of characteristics encompassing forest structure, plant traits and biogeochemistry. With respect to nutrient relations, montane forests are characterized by slow decomposition of organic matter, high investment in below-ground biomass and poor litter quality, relative to tropical lowland forests. However, within TMF there is considerable variation in substrate age, parent material, disturbance and species composition. Here we emphasize that many TMFs are likely to be co-limited by multiple nutrients, and that feedback among soil properties, species traits, microbial communities and environmental conditions drive forest productivity and soil carbon storage. To date, studies of the biogeochemistry of montane forests have been restricted to a few, mostly neotropical, sites and focused mainly on trees while ignoring mycorrhizas, epiphytes and microbial community structure. Incorporating the geographic, environmental and biotic variability in TMF will lead to a greater recognition of plant-soil feedbacks that are critical to understanding constraints on productivity, both under present conditions and under future climate, nitrogen-deposition and land-use scenarios. {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2015.

AB  - Tropical forests are a haven of biodiversity hosting the richest macrofungi in the World. However, the rate of forest loss greatly exceeds the rate of species documentation and this increases the risk of losing macrofungi diversity to extinction. A field study was carried out in Kereita, Kikuyu Escarpment Forest, southern part of Aberdare range forest to determine effect of indigenous forest conversion to plantation forest on diversity of macrofungi. Macrofungi diversity was assessed in a 22 year old Pinus patula (Pine) plantation and a pristine indigenous forest during dry (short rains, December, 2014) and wet (long rains, May, 2015) seasons. Field and laboratory methods included recording abundance and presence of fruiting bodies, taxonomic work and analysis of diversity in terms of density, species diversity indices and richness. A total number of 224 species were distributed across 28 families and 76 genera. Macrofungi species from families of Agaricaceae (20%), Mycenaceae (13%), Polyporaceae (10%) and Tricholomataceae (9%) were commonly represented taxa in the ecosystem. Most of the macrofungi recorded were saprophytic, mostly colonizing the litter and wood (41% and 36% respectively) based substrates, followed by soil organic matter species (15%). Ecto-mycorrhizal fungi (5%) and parasitic fungi (3%) were the least represented. Indigenous forests (natural ecosystems) recorded a wide range of mushroom assemblage (average of 6.5 species in a 400m2 plot and 3.5 individual fruiting bodies in 1m2 plot) compared to pine plantation forest. Conversion of indigenous forest to pine plantation altered species composition, but did not affect species diversity. More than 50% of the total macrofungi species were encountered during the wet season. Our results confirm diverse macrofungi community in forested ecosystems in Kenya, and need for their conservation. {\textcopyright} Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences.

AB  - We compiled quantitative estimates on symbiotic N2 fixation by trees in agroforestry systems (AFS) in order to evaluate the critical environmental and management factors that affect the benefit from N2 fixation to system N economy. The so-called "N2-fixing tree" is a tripartite symbiotic system composed of the plant, N2-fixing bacteria, and mycorrhizae-forming fungi. Almost 100 recognised rhizobial species associated with legumes do not form an evolutionary homologous clade and are functionally diverse. The global bacterial diversity is still unknown. Actinorrhizal symbioses in AFS remain almost unstudied. Dinitrogen fixation in AFS should be quantified using N isotopic methods or long-term system N balances. The general average ± standard deviation of tree dependency on N2 fixation (%Ndfa) in 38 cases using N isotopic analyses was 59 ± 16. 6 %. Under humid and sub-humid conditions, the percentage was higher in young (69 ± 10. 7 %) and periodically pruned trees (63 ± 11. 8 %) than in free-growing trees (54 ± 11. 7 %). High variability was observed in drylands (range 10-84 %) indicating need for careful species and provenance selection in these areas. Annual N2 fixation was the highest in improved fallow and protein bank systems, 300-650 kg [N] ha-1. General average for 16 very variable AFS was 246 kg [N] ha-1, which is enough for fulfilling crop N needs for sustained or increasing yield in low-input agriculture and reducing N-fertiliser use in large-scale agribusiness. Leaf litter and green mulch applications release N slowly to the soil and mostly benefit the crop through long-term soil improvement. Root and nodule turnover and N rhizodeposition from N2-fixing trees are sources of easily available N for the crop yet they have been largely ignored in agroforestry research. There is also increasing evidence on direct N transfer from N2-fixing trees to crops, e. g. via common mycelial networks of mycorrhizal fungi or absorption of tree root exudates by the crop. Research on the below-ground tree-crop-microbia interactions is needed for fully understanding and managing N2 fixation in AFS. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - As anthropogenic N deposition has been suspected to be the main reason for the decline of macromycetous sporocarp production in forest ecosystems, various N-fertilization experiments were started in the mid 1990s. The dynamics of ectomycorrhizal (root-inhabiting) and terricolous saprobic (litter-inhabiting) fungal communities were studied by exhaustive sporocarp inventories in a substitution Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest in two 256-m2 plots sampled for periods of 1 week at 1-m2 resolution between 1994 and 2007. N was added to the soil twice per year in one plot from the fourth year onwards. The effects of N input and time on aboveground fungal communities were assessed using redundancy analysis, principal response curves and non-parametric multivariate ANOVA. Results of this long-term experiment revealed that both ectomycorrhizal and saprobic fungal communities responded to an increase in soil N input. The ectomycorrhizal community reacted by a fast decrease in sporocarp production and in species richness, whereas the saprobic community was less affected. The response was highly species specific, especially for the saprobic community. The difference in species composition between control and fertilized plots was significant after 1 year of N addition for ectomycorrhizal fungi and only after 3 years for saprobic fungi. An aging effect affected sporocarp production in the whole area. For both communities, this unidirectional drift in species composition was as important as the treatment effect. This result highlights the importance of considering the respective role of treatment and year effects in long-term field experiments on fungal communities. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Fungi are major players in the carbon cycle in forest ecosystems due to the wide range of interactions they have with plants either through soil degradation processes by litter decayers or biotrophic interactions with pathogenic and ectomycorrhizal symbionts. Secretion of fungal proteins mediates these interactions by allowing the fungus to interact with its environment and/or host. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis independently appeared several times throughout evolution and involves approximately 80% of trees. Despite extensive physiological studies on ECM symbionts, little is known about the composition and specificities of their secretomes. In this study, we used a bioinformatics pipeline to predict and analyze the secretomes of 49 fungal species, including 11 ECM fungi, wood and soil decayers and pathogenic fungi to tackle the following questions: (1) Are there differences between the secretomes of saprophytic and ECM fungi? (2) Are small-secreted proteins (SSPs) more abundant in biotrophic fungi than in saprophytic fungi? and (3) Are there SSPs shared between ECM, saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi? We showed that the number of predicted secreted proteins is similar in the surveyed species, independently of their lifestyle. The secretome from ECM fungi is characterized by a restricted number of secreted CAZymes, but their repertoires of secreted proteases and lipases are similar to those of saprotrophic fungi. Focusing on SSPs, we showed that the secretome of ECM fungi is enriched in SSPs compared with other species. Most of the SSPs are coded by orphan genes with no known PFAM domain or similarities to known sequences in databases. Finally, based on the clustering analysis, we identified shared- and lifestyle-specific SSPs between saprotrophic and ECM fungi. The presence of SSPs is not limited to fungi interacting with living plants as the genome of saprotrophic fungi also code for numerous SSPs. ECM fungi shared lifestyle-specific SSPs likely involved in symbiosis that are good candidates for further functional analyses. {\textcopyright} 2015 Pellegrin, Morin, Martin and Veneault-Fourrey.

AB  - The two components of soil respiration, autotrophic respiration (from roots, mycorrhizal hyphae and associated microbes) and heterotrophic respiration (from decomposers), was separated in a root trenching experiment in a Norway spruce forest. In June 2003, cylinders (29.7 cm diameter) were inserted to 50 cm soil depth and respiration was measured both outside (control) and inside the trenched areas. The potential problems associated with the trenching treatment, increased decomposition of roots and ectomycorrhizal mycelia and changed soil moisture conditions, were handled by empirical modelling. The model was calibrated with respiration, moisture and temperature data of 2004 from the trenched plots as a training set. We estimate that over the first 5 months after the trenching, 45% of respiration from the trenched plots was an artefact of the treatment. Of this, 29% was a water difference effect and 16% resulted from root and mycelia decomposition. Autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration contributed to about 50% each of total soil respiration in the control plots averaged over the two growing seasons. We show that the potential problems with the trenching, decomposing roots and mycelia and soil moisture effects, can be handled by a modelling approach, which is an alternative to the sequential root harvesting technique. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - We investigated the response of soil microbial communities in tropical ecosystems to increased nutrient deposition, such as predicted by anthropogenic change scenarios. Moderate amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus and their combination were added along an altitudinal transect. We expected microorganisms and microbial grazers (testate amoebae) to significantly respond to nutrient additions with the effect increasing with increasing altitude and with duration of nutrient additions. Further, we expected nutrients to alter grazer-prey interrelationships. Indeed, nutrient additions strongly altered microbial biomass (MB) and community structure as well as the community structure of testate amoebae. The response of microorganisms varied with both altitude and duration of nutrient addition. The results indicate that microorganisms are generally limited by N, but saprotrophic fungi also by P. Also, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi benefited from N and/or P addition. Parallel to MB, testate amoebae benefited from the addition of N but were detrimentally affected by P, with the addition of P negating the positive effect of N. Our data suggests that testate amoeba communities are predominantly structured by abiotic factors and by antagonistic interactions with other microorganisms, in particular mycorrhizal fungi, rather than by the availability of prey. Overall, the results suggest that the decomposer system of tropical montane rainforests significantly responds to even moderate changes in nutrient inputs with the potential to cause major ramifications of the whole ecosystem including litter decomposition and plant growth. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.

AB  - sNitrogen (N) accumulation into woody debris is well documented, but the forms of N translocated, the mechanism through which this occurs (purportedly via translocation by cord-forming fungi) and the temporal pattern of N accumulation are not well studied. In soil microcosms, we incubated wood blocks (Pseudotsuga menziesii) inoculated with the cord-forming decay fungus Hypholoma fasciculare, and applied four forms of isotopically-labeled N ((NH4+)-N-15 (NO3-)-N-15, N-15-glycine and N-15 labeled litter) at the mycelial growing fronts to evaluate translocation and accumulation of diverse N sources by wood-decay fungi. Identically treated un-inoculated wood blocks were incubated. Three sampling times (6, 18 and 30 days after N addition) were used to identify trends in 15N transfer and total N accumulation. Wood blocks inoculated with H. fasciculare assimilated significantly more 15N than un-inoculated blocks for all 15N treatments on at least one sampling occasion. After a total of 73 days of incubation in microcosms, inoculated wood blocks increased in absolute N content by 211\% relative to control blocks, but 80\% of this accumulated N was lost by day 97. The small amount of 15N that was transferred into wood contrasted with the large increase in total N, suggesting that the site of N transfer was largely from soil under the wood blocks rather than at the site of 15N injection. The precipitous decline in N content was attributed to visible indications of mycelial senescence, possibly due to carbon limitation. If these findings are extrapolated to a cut-block, it follows that woody debris on the forest floor colonized by wood decay fungi would accumulate N, at least in the early stages of decay, and this process may immobilize N after harvest. If retention of N on site after harvest is a management objective, site preparation that maximizes accumulation of N in woody debris by saprotrophic fungi should be employed. This would involve homogenously distributing woody debris on site in close contact with the forest floor in order to promote fungal colonization and N accumulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - While it is well established that leaf litter decomposition is controlled by climate and substrate quality at broad spatial scales, conceptual frameworks that consider how local-scale factors affect litter decay in heterogeneous landscapes are generally lacking. A critical challenge in disentangling the relative impacts of and interactions among local-scale factors is that these factors frequently covary due to feedbacks between plant and soil communities. For example, forest plots dominated by trees that associate with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi often differ from those dominated by trees that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in terms of their litter quality, microbial community structure and inorganic nutrient availability. Here, we evaluate the extent to which such factors alter leaf litter decomposition rates. To characterize variations in decomposition rates, we compared decay rates of high-quality litter (maple; AM) and low-quality litter (oak; ECM) across forest plots representing a gradient in litter matrix quality and nitrogen (N) availability driven by the relative proportions of AM and ECM trees in each plot. In experiment two, we added litter from two AM and three ECM tree species to forest plots with either a high-quality litter matrix and high N availability (i.e. AM-dominated plots) or a low-quality litter matrix and low N availability (i.e. ECM-dominated plots). In both experiments, we found that AM litter decomposed more rapidly than ECM litter, and this effect was enhanced in AM-dominated plots. Then, to separate the contributions of litter matrix effects from N availability effects, we added N fertilizer to a subset of plots from experiment two. Nitrogen addition increased decay rates of high-quality litter across all sites, but had no effect on low-quality litter, suggesting that low N availability, not litter matrix quality, constrains decomposition of high-quality litters. Hence, N availability appears to alter litter decomposition patterns independently of litter matrix properties.Synthesis. Our results indicate that shifts in the relative abundance of ECM- and AM-associated trees in a plot or stand have the potential to affect litter decay rates through both changes in litter quality as well as through alterations of the local-scale soil environment.

AB  - In an old growth coniferous forest located in the central Cascade Mountains, Oregon, we added or removed aboveground litter and terminated live root activity by trenching to determine sources of soil respiration. Annual soil efflux from control plots ranged from 727 g C m-2 year-1 in 2002 to 841 g C m-2 year-1 in 2003. We used aboveground litter inputs (149.6 g C m-2 year-1) and differences in soil CO2 effluxes among treatment plots to calculate contributions to total soil efflux by roots and associated rhizosphere organisms and by heterotrophic decomposition of organic matter derived from aboveground and belowground litter. On average, root and rhizospheric respiration (R r) contributed 23%, aboveground litter decomposition contributed 19%, and belowground litter decomposition contributed 58% to total soil CO 2 efflux, respectively. These values fall within the range of values reported elsewhere, although our estimate of belowground litter contribution is higher than many published estimates, which we argue is a reflection of the high degree of mycorrhizal association and low nutrient status of this ecosystem. Additionally, we found that measured fluxes from plots with doubled needle litter led to an additional 186 g C m-2 year-1 beyond that expected based on the amount of additional carbon added; this represents a priming effect of 187%, or a 34% increase in the total carbon flux from the plots. This finding has strong implications for soil C storage, showing that it is inaccurate to assume that increases in net primary productivity will translate simply and directly into additional belowground storage. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.

AB  - We studied the sensitivity of soil microbial communities and ecosystem processes to variation in the vertical and horizontal structure of decomposer food web under nitrogen poor and N-enriched conditions. Microcosms with humus and litter layer of boreal forest floor, birch seedlings infected with mycorrhizal fungi, and decomposer food webs with differing trophic group and species composition of soil fauna were constructed. During the second growing period for the birch, we irrigated half of the microcosms with urea solution, and the other half with de-ionised water to create two levels of N concentration in the substrate. During the experiment night time respirations of the microcosms were measured, and the water leached through the microcosms was analysed for concentration of mineral N, and nematode numbers. The microcosms were destructively sampled after 37 weeks for plant biomass and N uptake, structure of soil animal and microbial community (indicated by PLFA profiles), and physical and chemical properties of the humus and litter materials. Predatory mites and nematodes had a negative influence on the biomass of their microbivorous and microbi-detritivorous prey, and microbi-detritivores affected the biomass and community structure of microbes (indicated by PLFA-analysis). Moreover, predatory mites and nematodes increased microbial biomass and changed the microbial community structure. The decomposer food web structure affected also N uptake and growth of plants. Microbi-detritivorous fauna had a positive effect, whereas predators of microbial and detritus feeding fauna exerted a negative influence on plant N uptake and biomass production. The impact of a trophic group on the microbes and plant was also strongly dependent on species composition within the group. Nitrogen addition magnified the influence of food web structure on microbial biomass and plant N uptake. We suggest that addition of urea-N to the soil modified the animal-microbe interaction by increasing microbial growth and altering community structure of microbes. The presence of microbi-detritivores and predators reduced loss of carbon from the microcosms, and the food web structure influenced also water holding capacity of the materials. The changes in plant growth, nutrient cycling, size of N and C pools, and in the physical properties of the soil emphasize the importance and diversity of indirect consequences of decomposer food web structure.

AB  - In the reported experiments, green and brown needles of Pinus sylvestris, both on the tree and as litter after various lengths of time, were compared to determine differences in composition of various groups of lipophilic extractives, low-molecular-weight carbohydrates, cyclitols, phenolic glycosides, polysaccharides, lignin, ash, and crude protein. Also discussed is work in progress concerned with the manner in which extracts from these sources, as well as from spruce (Picea abies) and aspen (Populus tremula), affect some litter-decomposing and mycorrhizal fungi.

AB  - Changes in temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration that are expected in the coming decades will have profound impacts on terrestrial ecosystem net primary production (NPP). Nearly all models linking forest NPP with soil carbon (C) predict that increased NPP will result in either unchanged or increased soil C storage, and that decreased NPP will result in decreased soil C storage. However, linkages between forest productivity and soil C storage may not be so simple and direct. In an old-growth coniferous forest located in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, OR, USA, we experimentally doubled needle litter inputs, and found that actual soil respiration rates exceeded those expected due to the C added by the extra needles. Here, we estimated that this 'priming effect' accounted for 11.5-21.6% of annual CO2 efflux from litter-amended plots, or an additional 137-256 g C m-2 yr-1 loss of stored C to the atmosphere. Soil priming was seasonal, with greatest amounts occurring in June-August coincident with peaks in temperature and dry summer conditions. As a result of priming, mineral soil was more resistant to further mineralization during laboratory incubations. Soil lignin-derived phenols in the Double Litter plots were more oxidized than in the control, suggesting that the soil residue was more degraded. Our hypothesis that excess dissolved organic C produced from the added litter provided the link between the forest floor and mineral soil and a substrate for soil priming was not supported. Instead, the rhizosphere, and associated mycorrhizal fungi, likely responded directly to the added aboveground litter inputs. Our results revealed that enhanced NPP may lead to accelerated processing of some stored soil C, but that the effects of increased NPP on ecosystem C storage will be based on a net balance among all ecosystem C pools and are likely to be ecosystem-dependant. Forest C models need to include these complex linkages between forest productivity and soil C storage. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heterotrophic soil microbes regulate the rate-limiting step in soil organic matter decomposition via the production of hydrolytic and oxidative extracellular enzymes. The influence of climate change on heterotrophic microbial activity remains poorly understood, not least in terms of the differential sensitivity of microbial functional groups to warming and altered precipitation regimes. Cord-forming basidiomycete fungi dominate primary decomposition in temperate woodlands. We investigate the interactive influence of elevated temperature (3 degrees C), wetting and drying (6-9\% increase and 5-6\% decrease of soil moisture, respectively) on saprotrophic basidiomycete-mediated beech (Fagus sylvatica) wood decomposition, as well as on hydrolytic (beta-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, beta-xylosidase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, acid phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase) and oxidative (peroxidase and phenoloxidase) enzyme potential activities, in woodland soil mesocosms. While drying decreased beech wood decomposition rate, warming resulted in an increased rate and compensated for the negative effect of drying. Moisture regulated the extracellular enzyme pool; all enzymes except leucine aminopeptidase had significantly greater potential activity under wetting than drying. Again, elevated temperature consistently compensated for the negative effect of drying, but did not increase extracellular enzyme potential activity, alone or in combination with wetting. This reflects microbial production (fungal biomass was not increased under these conditions) rather than in situ effects on enzyme kinetics. N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and acid phosphatase displayed differential responses to temperature and moisture in systems dominated by different fungi. Decomposer communities appear to be more functionally resilient to the combined effects of elevated temperature and altered moisture than is suggested based on the manipulation of single abiotic variables.

AB  - Present study focused on how the presence of decaying wood affects soil environment including its biota. The study was carried out in the montane spruce forest, disturbed by wind and bark beetles in Trojmezn{\'{a}} Mt. of the Bohemian Forest in the Czech Republic. According to the results, presence of decomposing wood influenced soil environment in terms of its chemical properties by increasing soil pH and total carbon content significantly in soil below the trunks compared with soil from further distance. Decomposing wood did not affect total density and species richness of Collembola, but it had a significant influence on species composition and some species were more abundant in soil right below the trunks whereas others preferred soil environment further from them. Finally, significant relations, both positive and negative, were recorded between some Collembola species and ammonium. Thus, this substance might play a role of a volatile attractant in soil environment. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Crop production in subsistence agriculture in tropical Africa is still sustained mainly by short-to medium-term fallows to recuperate natural fertility of the soils. Microbes play a pivotal role both in the process of soil fertility restoration and in nutrient acquisition by the crops. Here we ask the question how the duration of fallow affects the composition of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities and their contribution to maize nutrition and growth, in acidic, low P soils of southern Cameroon. This question has been addressed in a bioassay where soils collected from continuously cropped fields, short-term fallows dominated by Chromolaena odorata and long-term fallows (secondary forests) have been sterilized and back- and cross inoculated with living soils from the different land-use systems. Particular microbes larger than the pore size of the filter paper (mainly the fungi including the AMF) contained in the cropped and short-fallowed soils caused greater growth and P uptake stimulations to the maize as compared to the forest soil. By using molecular profiling, we demonstrated a shift in the composition of AMF communities along a gradient of fallow duration, changing from dominance by Rhizophagus in the forest fallow soil, to dominance by Claroideoglomus under cropland. Our results contradict the hypothesis that deterioration of quality of root symbiotic communities would be responsible for a rapid yield decline following deforestation, and indicate a positive feedback of cropping on mycorrhizal functioning under conditions of shifting agriculture in tropical Africa.

AB  - This was a study of vegetation and soil properties in tree-fall gaps in a coniferous forest of the Pacific Northwest. It had three objectives: (1) to determine if there are correlations between above-ground vegetation and below-ground soil properties within large 50 m diameter gaps, (2) to determine how large gaps influence forest soils compared with non-gap soils, and (3) to measure the effects of differently sized gaps on gap soils. To address these objectives, circular canopy gaps were created in old-growth Douglas-fir forests of the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Oregon Cascade Mountains. To address the first objective, within-gap soil spatial patterns were compared with above ground distributions of both vegetation and large woody debris in two large gaps. Spatial and Pearson correlation analyses showed no consistent correlations between soil characteristics and above ground vegetation and coarse woody debris. With reference to the second objective, statistically significant differences between gap and non-gap soil characteristics were observed. Soil moisture, temperature and denitrification potentials were all elevated in forest 50 m diameter gaps and litter depth, labile C, soil respiration, -gluosidase activity, and ectomytcorrhizal mat concentrations were all reduced. Comparisons between north and south gap soils, showed significant differences in soil characteristics in one but not the other 50 m gap. The third objective was addressed by documenting gap size effects on differences between gap and non gap soil characteristics in two gaps each of 10, 20, 30, and 50 m diameter. Differences between gap and nongap soil moisture, litter depth and ectomycorrhizal mat coverages were essentially the same regardless of gap size. Soil respiration rates and soil organic matter concentrations were similar in 10 m gaps but both lower in gaps 20 m and larger. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Northwest Scientific Association.

AB  - Removal of litter and humus layers by management practices or by wind had a positive effect on the ectomycorrhizal flora. Field experiments were set up in stands of Pinus sylvestris to study the effects of removing the ectorganic layer. Sod-cutting had a positive effect on the number of ectomycorrhizal species and on the number of carpophores. Adding sods had a negative effect on the number of ectomycorrhizal species and on the number of carpophores. Pine litter reduced the growth of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria proxima completely, but had a stimulatory effect on L. bicolor. Growth of Paxillus involutus was inhibited by high concentrations of the extracts, and the growth of Xerocomus badius was significantly reduced by all concentrations. -from Authors

AB  - The ectomycorrhizal fungus Hysterangium setchellii (Fisher) forms extensive hyphal mats at the soil-litter interface with the roots of its host tree Douglas fir {Pseudotsuga menziesii [(Mirb.) Franco]}. Microbial biomass, needle decomposition rates, nutrient release from needles and exchangeable soil nutrients were measured in ectomycorrhizal mat soils and adjacent non-mat soils in a second-growth Douglas fir forest periodically throughout 1 yr. Microbial biomass and needle decomposition were 4.0 and 1.1 times higher, respectively, in mat soils than in adjacent non-mat soils during the year of sampling. After 1 yr of decomposition, needle litter concentrations of K and Mg decreased in both soil types, and release of both nutrients was greater in mats than in non-mat soils. Needle litter concentrations of Ca, Mn, Cu. Zn and Al increased during the year in both soil types, but nutrient absorption by needles tended to be highest in non-mat soils. Concentrations of N, P, Fe and B in needle litter did not change during the year, yet nearly twice as much N and P were released in mat soils compared to non-mat soils, suggesting either faster decomposition or nutrient import to mat soils. Soil solution concentrations of nh4, P, K, Mg and Zn measured by absorption onto ion-exchange resins, did not differ between mat and non-mat soils. Mat soils had higher concentrations of NO3, Fe, Cu and B but lower concentrations of Ca and Mn compared to non-mat soils. Nutrients released from the decomposing needles but not absorbed by ion-exchange resins must be rapidly removed from the soil solution either by plant roots, microbial tissue, saprophytic fungi or via ectomycorrhizal translocation to host trees. Our data suggest that the ectomycorrhizal fungus H. seichelli provides an improved microcnvironment for organic matter decomposition resulting in faster release of N, P, K, and Mg and more efficient removal of the nutrients from the soil solution. {\textcopyright} 1991.

AB  - The decomposition of plant organic matter and the stability of soil aggregates are important components of soil carbon cycling, and the relationship between decomposition rate and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has recently received considerable attention. The interaction of AMF with their associated microorganisms and the consequences for litter decomposition and soil aggregation still remain fairly unclear. In a laboratory pot experiment we simultaneously tested the single and combined effects of one AMF species (Rhizophagus irregularis) and a natural non-AMF microbial community on the decomposition of small wooden sticks and on soil aggregation. To disentangle effects of hyphae and roots we placed mesh bags as root exclusion compartments in the soil. The decomposition of the wooden sticks in this compartment was significantly reduced in the presence of AMF, but not with the non-AMF microbial community only, compared to the control, while aggregation was increased in all treatments compared to the control. We suggest that AMF directly (via localized nutrient removal or altered moisture conditions) or indirectly (by providing an alternative carbon source) inhibited the activity of decomposers, leading to different levels of plant litter degradation under our experimental settings. Reduced decomposition of woody litter in presence of AMF can be important for nutrient cycling in AMF-dominated forests and in the case of woody plants and perennials that develop lignified roots in grasslands.

AB  - Fungal community composition often shifts in response to warmer temperatures, which might influence decomposition of recalcitrant carbon (C). We hypothesized that evolutionary trade-offs would enable recalcitrant C-using taxa to respond more positively to warming than would labile C-using taxa. Accordingly, we performed a warming experiment in an Alaskan boreal forest and examined changes in the prevalence of fungal taxa. In a complementary field trial, we characterized the ability of fungal taxa to use labile C (glucose), intermediate C (hemicellulose or cellulose), or recalcitrant C (lignin). We also assigned taxa to functional groups (e.g., free-living filamentous fungi, ectomycorrhizal fungi, and yeasts) based on taxonomic identity. We found that response to warming varied most among taxa at the order level, compared to other taxonomic ranks. Among orders, ability to use lignin was significantly related to increases in prevalence in response to warming. However, the relationship was weak, given that lignin use explained only 9% of the variability in warming responses. Functional groups also differed in warming responses. Specifically, free-living filamentous fungi and ectomycorrhizal fungi responded positively to warming, on average, but yeasts responded negatively. Overall, warming-induced shifts in fungal communities might be accompanied by an increased ability to break down recalcitrant C. This change in potential function may reduce soil C storage under global warming. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Aim: Trees associating with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi typically occur in infertile soils and use nutrients more conservatively than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees. We hypothesized that ECM trees would have greater nutrient resorption (i.e., proportion of nutrients resorbed during leaf senescence) than AM trees. Location: Global. Methods: We synthesized nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) resorption data from 378 species from sub/tropical, temperate and boreal forests, including 43 studies where ECM and AM trees co-occurred, and conducted a meta-analysis. Additionally, we quantified N resorption in 45 plots varying in ECM-AM tree abundances in the temperate deciduous forests of southern Indiana, USA. Results: Overall, resorption patterns were driven primarily by mycorrhizal type, climate zone, and to a lesser degree, leaf habit. In the boreal forest, P resorption was 76% greater for ECM than AM trees (p <.05). In the sub/tropics, AM trees resorbed 30% more N than ECM trees. At the sites where AM and ECM trees co-occurred, ECM trees resorbed more N in temperate forests (15% greater; p <.001) whereas AM trees tended to resorb more N in sub/tropical forests (by 29%; p =.08). Besides, deciduous ECM trees resorbed more N (10%) and P (15%) than deciduous AM trees, while evergreen ECM and AM trees did not differ. In the deciduous forests of Indiana, where ECM and AM trees co-occurred, the relative abundance of ECM trees in a plot was positively correlated to plot-scale N resorption (R2 =.25, p =.001), indicating greater nutrient conservatism with increasing ECM-dominance. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that mycorrhizal association – in addition to other factors – is correlated with the degree to which trees recycle nutrients, with the strongest effects occurring for N resorption by temperate deciduous trees. {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - We compared the delta C-13 and delta N-15  of forest material with an extensive sporocarp collection to elucidate the role of litter, wood and soil as fungal carbon and nitrogen sources in Finnish boreal Picea abies-dominated forests. Ectomycorrhizal Hydnum and Cortinarius had higher delta N-15 than other ectomycorrhizal fungi, suggesting use of N-15-enriched, deeper nitrogen. Russula had lower delta N-15  than other ectomycorrhizal fungi and resembled some litter decay genera, suggesting use of litter-derived nitrogen. There was little variation in delta N-15 among other genera of ectomycorrhizal fungi, indicating limited functional diversity in nitrogen use. Saprotrophic Leotia, Gymnopus, Hypholoma, Pholiota, Rhodocollybia and Calocera had delta N-15 values similar to ectomycorrhizal fungi, indicating overlap in use of older nitrogen from soil or roots or use of newly fixed nitrogen. Genera of litter and wood decay fungi varied up to 6 parts per thousand in delta C-13 and 10 parts per thousand in delta N-15, suggesting large differences in carbon and nitrogen sources and processing. Similar delta C-13 between white and brown rot wood decay fungi also suggest that white rot fungi do not use lignin-derived carbon. Together, these delta C-13 and delta N-15  patterns of fungi from Finnish boreal forests enhance our knowledge of fungal functional diversity and indicate broad use of litter, wood and soil resources.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Quercus rubra L. (Red Oak, Northern Red Oak; syn. Q. borealis, Q. maxima) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution; habitat; communities; responses to biotic factors; responses to environment; structure and physiology; phenology; floral and seed characters; herbivores and disease; history; and conservation. Quercus rubra is a large deciduous tree native to eastern North America. In its native range this species is one of the most important mid-successional tree species. Since the 18th century Q. rubra has been introduced into forest management in Europe and elsewhere. Currently, Q. rubra is a naturalized species in 23 countries. It is an important source of wood, and this was one of the most important reasons for its introduction in forests. In forest management this species is valued for its high growth rate and drought resistance. Red Oak is also widely cultivated in Europe for its ornamental value—red leaves in autumn and smooth, grey bark. Red Oak is a threat to native species within its introduced range as it can alter environmental conditions beneath its canopy, especially by decreasing light availability and litter decomposition rate. Such conditions also contribute to biotic homogenization of the understorey vegetation. Q. rubra is widely dispersed by small mammals and birds, up to 1,500 m from seed sources, thereby increasing its potential invasiveness. In Europe Q. rubra seems to be less prone to herbivores and fungi, in contrast to its native range, where it is grazed by ungulates and insects, and infected by Phytophthora and oak wilt. Due to its higher tolerance to drought than native European oaks, Q. rubra is claimed to be one of the species replacing native trees which are decreasing due to climate warming. However, consideration of all possible consequences is needed in wide-scale introduction of alien species, such as Q. rubra, due to negative impacts on native ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2020 British Ecological Society

AB  - A central tenet of biological science is that living organisms modify their environments. Metabiosis is a form of ecological dependence in which one organism or a functional group of organisms must modify the environment before another organism or functional group of organisms can live or thrive in it. Soil ecosystems are modified by metabionts to create habitats or supply resources for which dependent organisms may adapt, evolve and hence diversify. Thus, the diversity of the soil biota and its functional capabilities may to a large extent be the result of and dependent upon metabiotic activity and influences. Examples of metabiotic activity in soil ecosystems are: plants are the main source of O-2 for the soil biota; decomposers deplete soil O-2 thus enabling the growth of microaerophiles or anaerobes; ammonium released by bacterial deamination supports the growth of autotrophic ammonium-oxidisers; burrowing earthworms improve soil drainage and create aeration channels for aerobic biota; detoxification of plant residues by biodegraders permits proliferation of toxin-sensitive organisms; wood decay by microbes creates habitats for arthropods associated with rotting wood; arthropod comminution of litter liberates nutrients that facilitate microbial activity. Some metabionts, the panmetabionts, had a global influence by modifying the biosphere, its evolving biota and by maintaining its biogeochemistry. For example, during the development of the biosphere the cyanobacteria began the transformation of the atmosphere through the production of O-2 The accumulation of atmospheric O-2 had an overwhelming influence on the formation of soils, their physico-chemistry and biology, in particular the evolution of diverse major groups of aerobic terrestrial organisms (plants, fungi and animals). Many practices to improve soil fertility, e.g. agro-forestry, mulching, legume inoculation, minimum tillage are applications of metabiotic techniques, which maintain or improve soil biodiversity and its functional potentiality. Conversely, where ecosystems are degraded through human activity, e.g. forest destruction, irrigation with saline water, strip-mining, deep tillage, there is an inevitable reduction of species of animals and plants. It can also result in the loss of some components of the soil community, e.g. mycorrhizal fungi, macrobiota such as invertebrates, with a consequent reduction in or a loss of I:he metabiotic activities of functional groups of the soil biota. Types of metabiotic action include facilitation, ecological engineering, commensalism and keystone predation. Metabiosis must rank with biotic interrelationships and interactions, such as competition, predation or mutualism, in its effects upon soil communities and ecosystems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Introduction Mycorrhizal fungi play a central role in biogeochemical cycles since they obtain carbon from their photosynthetic plant hosts and allocate this via their mycelia to the soil ecosystem. The mycelia interact with a range of organic and inorganic substrates, as well as with different organisms such as bacteria, fungi, soil micro-and meso-fauna and the roots of secondary hosts or non-host plants. Some of the carbon allocated to the mycelium is used to make compounds such as enzymes, organic acids, siderophores or antibiotics, which influence biotic or abiotic substrates through processes such as decomposition, weathering or antibiosis. Organic and inorganic nutrients mobilized from these substrates can be taken up by the mycorrhizal mycelia and translocated to their plant hosts, influencing plant growth, community structure and vegetation dynamics. Ultimately these changes have further impacts on biogeochemical cycles. Different types of mycorrhizal symbiosis have evolved as adaptations to different suites of edaphic parameters, resulting in the characteristic vegetation types that dominate different terrestrial biomes. Other chapters in this book consider specific contributions of ectomycorrhizal fungi to mineral dissolution (see Wallander, Chapter 14, this volume), carbon and nitrogen cycling (see Hobbie & Wallander, Chapter 5, this volume) and mineral tunnelling (see Smits, Chapter 13, this volume). In this chapter we concentrate on how these activities are integrated and on ways in which ectomycorrhizal hyphae may interact with other microorganisms to influence biogeochemical cycles. {\textcopyright} British Mycological Society 2006.

AB  - In the southern part of Korup National Park, Cameroon, nine replicate plots (40 x 80 m) in forest with low abundances (5-15% of the basal area of all trees ≤30 cm gbh [girth at breast height]; LEM) and nine with high abundances (45-68%; HEM) of ectomycorrhizal caesalpiniaceous legumes were selected from an earlier enumeration along an east-west 5-km transect. The codominant caesalps in HEM plots were Microberlinia bisulcata, Tetraberlinia bifoliolata, and T. moreliana, and ordination showed the LEM and HEM plots to be floristically distinct. The HEM plots lay in a large well-defined patch of these caesalps, set within surrounding LEM forest. A further contrast to HEM forest was achieved by selecting six LEM and six VLEM plots (very low, ≃0% ectomycorrhizal trees) on a second transect 12 km to the north. Korup has an annual rainfall of 5180 mm with one very distinct 3-mo dry season (December-February). The soils are sandy, acidic, and very phosphorus poor. The aim was to determine whether LEM and HEM plots differed in their litter and soil phosphorus status and the characteristics of their phosphorus cycles. On 13 occasions between August 1988 and September 1990, litter and soils in the surface root layer and the mineral layer 5 cm below were sampled on the main transect and analyzed for phosphorus fractions. This analysis distinguished between inorganic and organic forms and provided various measures of lability. Nitrogen and carbon contents, pH, and moisture contents of each layer, depth of the root layer, and amounts of litter (i.e., litter mass) and soil were the other main variables. In a subset of plots, leaf litterfall was collected over the period and analyzed for phosphorus and nitrogen, and two litter-bag experiments in early wet seasons estimated rates of litter disappearance. Root biomass and change with depth were estimated from pit samples within the plots. HEM plots had slightly higher mean basal area of trees than LEM plots (32.3 and 27.1 m2/ha, respectively) and higher fine root (≤5 mm diameter) biomasses (519 and 364 g/m2, 0-5 cm), but the same mean litter mass (155 g/m2) and annual leaf litterfall (720 g/m2) and very similar disappearance rates (1.82 g{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}d-1 on litterfall/mass basis; t 1/4 of 53 d from litter bags). Litter mass (and litterfall) reached a clear peak in the mid-dry season in both HEM and LEM plots (slightly earlier in HEM), almost completely disappearing by mid-wet season. The phosphorus concentrations in HEM falling leaf litter was much greater than in LEM (801 and 676 $\mu$g/g) leading to greater inputs (1.79 and 1.35 mg{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}d-1), while for nitrogen the concentrations and inputs were very similar (means 17.8 mg/g, 35.3 mg{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}d-1). An important feature was the marked peak in phosphorus (but not nitrogen) concentration in litter in the HEM plots only in those years that did not follow a mast fruiting. Depth of the root layer was greater in the HEM than LEM plots (8.1 and 4.2 mm), as was carbon content (5.5 and 4.0%), but bulk density was less (0.85 and 1.30 g/cm3). Moisture contents, which tracked the seasons in all three layers, were slightly higher in HEM than LEM, as were clay and silt contents, but pH values were lower (4.19 and 4.59, root layer). The relative differences in the eight soil phosphorus fractions (resin-, bicarbonate- and NaOH-extractable, and chloroform-labile, inorganic, and organic) plus residual and total phosphorus were remarkably consistent between HEM and LEM plots. In the root layer total phosphorus was much higher in HEM than LEM plots (309 and 186 $\mu$g/g, respectively) and likewise in the mineral layer (192 and 119 $\mu$g/g, respectively): HEM/LEM ratios of ≃1.6 were maintained across nearly all fractions. Covariance analysis indicated that the basal areas of LEM and HEM plots could not account for the differences in phosphorus concentrations. Different fractions followed different trends with time, but these did not match seasons and showed, for the more labile inorganic phosphorus fractions especially, a linear decline over the study period. Interactions between forest type and date (split-plot repeated-measures analysis of variance) were rarely significant even though date itself invariably was. In marked contrast, nitrogen fractions did not decline, and lablie organic nitrogen showed clear seasonal peaks. Differences between the LEM forest on the two transects (two occasions in common) were small and inconsistent, supporting the wider contrast with HEM plots. Principal components analysis of the phosphorus and nitrogen fractions showed a strong discrimination between LEM and HEM plots. Calculation with amounts of phosphorus in the top 6 cm of the soil showed very similar patterns to the concentrations. Large ectomycorrhizal trees appeared to have increased the depth of the surface root layer, its phosphorus content, the labile phosphorus fraction (notably its organic component), and to have enhanced phosphorus cycling. The role of ectomycorrhizas in this process is discussed. The decline in labile phosphorus is explained by a phenological and climatic ectomycorrhizal response (PACER) hypothesis that highlights the relationship between phosphorus demand in mast fruiting years and soil phosphorus concentrations. The importance of this in adaptations by ectomycorrhizal caesalps to this strongly seasonal and phosphorus-poor site is considered.

AB  - Fine roots and mycorrhizae have recently been shown to produce a major portion of the organic matter entering decomposition. Roots and mycorrhizae constitute 63 to 70% of total net primary production in Douglas-fir and Pacific silver fir stands. The importance of roots in primary production makes the method of root extraction from the soil important. Wet-sieving with small mesh screens is more effective than hand-sorting for fine roots and mycorrhizae. Screen size, the efficiency of recovery, the physiological status of the roots and coversion factors to derive biomass from the numbers of root tips should be stated. Published data is enhanced if the phenological status of the stand, its age, tree density, and soil texture are quoted. Given the large fluxes in fine root and mycorrhiza populations, single biomass estimates are not useful in studies of ecosystem structure and function. A better understanding needs accurate methods to distinguish live and dead roots, data on the production and turnover of large roots, and data on the transfer of nutrients accompanying the large input of roots to decomposition. {\textcopyright} 1983 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W.

AB  - In south-central Chile, basal area and wood volume development of Nothofagus spp. in some forests has been shown to be independent of that of associated tree species. Although this has been attributed to the emergent habit of Nothofagus, here we explore the possible role of belowground resource partitioning. We measured fine root biomass and vertical distribution of emergent Nothofagus dombeyi and its canopy associates in an old-growth rain forest, to test for evidence of vertical partitioning of belowground resources. Fine roots were sampled to a depth of 80 cm in three plots. Total fine root biomass averaged 4685 g m-1, N. dombeyi contributing about 22% of this figure. Roots were concentrated mainly in the upper horizons, with 69% of the total occurring at <30 cm. However, fine root biomass of N. dombeyi declined significantly more steeply with depth than that of its associates did, the average contribution of N. dombeyi to total fine root biomass decreasing from 29% in the uppermost 10 cm, to little more than 1% at 70-80 cm. The observed differences in rooting depth could be linked to differences in mycorrhizal syndromes: ectomycorrhizal Nothofagus might be expected to be more shallow-rooted than the VAM and non-mycorrhizal canopy species, because of the reportedly greater ability of ectomycorrhizal species to assimilate organic nitrogen from the litter layer. A degree of belowground resource use complementarity may therefore minimize competition between N. dombeyi and its associates, and could thus contribute to the additive basal area and productivity observed in these forests. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Isotopes of nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) in ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi contain important information about ecological functioning, but the complexity of physiological and ecosystem processes contributing to fungal carbon and nitrogen dynamics has limited our ability to explain differences across taxa. Here, we measured delta N-15 and delta C-13 in needles, litter, soil, wood, fungal caps, and fungal stipes at numerous forested sites in Oregon, USA to determine how functional attributes and biochemical processes may influence isotopic values. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were classified by hydrophobicity of ectomycorrhizae and by patterns of hyphal exploration: saprotrophic fungi were classified into wood decay and litter decay fungi. For delta N-15, caps of hydrophobic taxa averaged 8.6 parts per thousand, hydrophilic taxa 3.2 parts per thousand and saprotrophic taxa 0.5 parts per thousand, whereas needles averaged 3 parts per thousand and soil at 5-12 cm averaged 2 parts per thousand. Caps were higher in delta N-15, delta C-13, \%N, and \%C than stipes by 1.7 parts per thousand, 0.6 parts per thousand 1.75\%, and 2.61\%, respectively, presumably because of greater protein content in caps than stipes. Isotopic enrichment of caps relative to stipes was greater in hydrophobic taxa (3.1 parts per thousand for N-15 and 0.8 parts per thousand, for C-13) than in hydrophilic taxa (1.1 parts per thousand for N-15 and 0.5 parts per thousand for C-13). In multiple regressions, 45\% of variance in delta N-15(cap-stipe) and 30\% of variance in delta C-13(cap-stipe) was accounted for by various elemental, isotopic, and categorical variables. We estimated that fungal protein was enriched in N-15 relative to fungal chitin by 15 parts per thousand in hydrophobic taxa and by 7 parts per thousand in hydrophilic taxa. Fungal protein was enriched in C-13 by 4.2 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand relative to carbohydrates. Isotopic signatures of sources and isotopic fractionation during metabolic processing influence both isotopic patterns of sporocarps and the isotopic partitioning between caps and stipes; functional groups differed in processing of both nitrogen isotopes and carbon isotopes.

AB  - • Soil microorganisms are considered C-limited, while plant productivity is frequently N-limited. Large stores of organic C in boreal forest soils are attributed to negative effects of low temperature, soil acidity and plant residue recalcitrance upon microbial activity. • We examined microbial activity, biomass and community composition along a natural 90-m-long soil N supply gradient, where plant species composition varies profoundly, forest productivity three-fold and soil pH by three units. • There was, however, no significant variation in soil respiration in the field across the gradient. Neither did microbial biomass C determined by fumigation-extraction vary, while other estimates of activity and biomass showed a weak increase with increasing N supply and soil pH. Simultaneously, a phospholipid fatty acid attributed mainly to mycorrhizal fungi declined drastically, while bacterial biomass increased. • We hypothesize that low N supply and plant productivity, and hence low litter C supply to saprotrophs is associated with a high plant C supply to mycorrhizal fungi, while the reverse occurs under high N supply. This should mean that effects of N availability on C supply to these functional groups of microbes acts in opposing directions. {\textcopyright} New Phytologist (2003).

AB  - Storage of C in forest soils is dependent on plant production rates, allocation of C, decomposition rate of products entering the soil, and stabilization within the soil by aggregation, absorption, and humification. The largest contributions to soil C pools are roots and litter. Estimates of litter are available for many ecosystems, but values for roots and fine-root production are difficult to obtain (Nadelhoffer and Raich, 1992) and pose an obstacle for understanding physiological activities of soil organisms (Zak and Pregitzer, 1998). Litter contributes cellulose, hemicellulose, lignins, pigments, water-soluble sugars, amino acids, aliphatic acids, and alcohol- and ether-soluble constituents including fats, oils, waxes, and resins. While roots contain a number of the same components, they also contribute to the soil C pool by providing, to depth, a diet with rapid turnover of dead tissue, mucilage, and cells sloughed off the growing root tip as it moves through soil (Ulrich et al., 1981). Before roots enter the detrital pool they also contribute root-derived substrates that fuel rhizosphere communities and stimulate the initiation of symbiotic relationships such as mycorrhizae. Regardless of the source, plant materials and the biomass produced from consumption of live plant materials contribute to detrital pools that support the complex food webs that in part regulate C sequestration in soils. {\textcopyright} 2003 by CRC Press LLC.

AB  - Specialized ectomycorrhizal fungi form dense mats in forest soils that have different enzyme levels, higher respiration rates, more biomass, different soil fauna, and different soil chemistry compared with adjacent soils not obviously colonized by these mats. In this study, mats formed by two genera of fungi collected in three locations were compared with a wide range of measurements. Per cent moisture, pH, chloroform fumigation-flush C, anaerobic N mineralization, exchangeable ammonium, and respiration, N2 fixation, and denitrification rates were compared between soils or litter colonized by ectomycorrhizal mat-forming fungi and adjacent non-mat material. Significant differences were observed between the two genera of mat-forming fungi and also between mats formed primarily in mineral soil and those formed in litter. These differences suggest that different mat-forming fungi perform different functions in forest soils and that these fungi function differently in mineral soil compared with litter. {\textcopyright} 1991 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Tree species associated with different mycorrhizal fungi play a crucial role in the carbon (C) cycling of forest ecosystems, while their effects on soil respiration (RS) and the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. In this study, we used a common garden experiment that included five monocultures (two arbuscular mycorrhizal – (AM) and three ectomycorrhizal-associated (ECM) temperate tree species) to explore the effects of mycorrhizal associations on the RS and the driving factors. Our specific objectives were to (1) compare the RS between the AM and ECM stands, and (2) explore the driving factors of the RS. We found that the RS in the AM stands was significantly greater (34.3%) than that in the ECM stands. The RS was significantly and positively correlated with microbial biomass C (Cmic), fine roots biomass (Broot), or soil water content (W5), but negatively with forest floor mass (Fmass) or soil dissolved organic C content (Cdis). The best-fitted models of RS explained 46.3%, 38.3%, and 45.4% of the variations in the RS for the AM stands, the ECM stands, and the combined dataset, respectively. However, the factors contributing to the RS varied with mycorrhizal groups. The RS of the AM stands was mainly influenced by Cmic, Broot, root C/N ratio, Fmass, and Cdis, whereas the RS of the ECM stands was mainly affected by litter C/N ratio, Cdis, soil dissolved nitrogen content, soil temperature and W5. These findings highlight the significance of shifts in AM or ECM tree abundance due to forest management and global change in forest C cycling. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study presents results of macrofungal inventory in the Western Ghat forest of Karnataka (reserve forest, shola forest, sacred grove and coffee agroforest) during wet season (June—November). A total of 157 species belonging to 87 genera was recovered. A maximum of 53 species was found in the coffee agroforest with highest diversity, exclusive (confined to a specific forest: 42 sp.) and core-group (frequency of occurrence, ≥10%: 17 sp.) species. Irrespective of forest, the species richness attained peaks during June and September. Rarefaction indices of species against sporocarps also showed the highest expected number of species in coffee agroforest. Of a total of 9256 sporocarps, the coffee agroforest consists of highest sporocarps than other forests (3715 vs. 1676—2999). Two-way ANOVA revealed significant spatial difference in richness of species (P < 0.01) as well as sporocarps (P < 0.05) without significant difference temporally. Low species similarity among forests surveyed (2.4—8.5%) depicts uniqueness of macrofungi in these forests. This survey yielded 45 new records to the Western Ghats and 47 economically valuable core-group fungi (edible, medicinal and ectomycorrhizal). Maintenance of suitable edaphic conditions along with enrichment organic matter (woody and leaf litter) in coffee agroforests seems to maximize economically viable macrofungi. {\textcopyright} 2016, AL{\"{O}}KI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Forest soils represent important terrestrial carbon (C) pools where C is primarily fixed in the plant-derived biomass but it flows further through the biomass of fungi and bacteria before it is lost from the ecosystem as CO2 or immobilized in recalcitrant organic matter. Microorganisms are the main drivers of C flow in forests and play critical roles in the C balance through the decomposition of dead biomass of different origins. Here, we track the path of C that enters forest soil by following respiration, microbial biomass production, and C accumulation by individual microbial taxa in soil microcosms upon the addition of 13C-labeled biomass of plant, fungal, and bacterial origin. We demonstrate that both fungi and bacteria are involved in the assimilation and mineralization of C from the major complex sources existing in soil. Decomposer fungi are, however, better suited to utilize plant biomass compounds, whereas the ability to utilize fungal and bacterial biomass is more frequent among bacteria. Due to the ability of microorganisms to recycle microbial biomass, we suggest that the decomposer food web in forest soil displays a network structure with loops between and within individual pools. These results question the present paradigms describing food webs as hierarchical structures with unidirectional flow of C and assumptions about the dominance of fungi in the decomposition of complex organic matter. {\textcopyright} 2018 International Society for Microbial Ecology.

AB  - In the strongly seasonal, but annually very wet, parts of the tropics, low-water at availability in the short dry season leads to a semi-deciduous forest, one which is also highly susceptible tu nutrient loss from leaching in the long wet season. Patterns in litterfall were compared between forest with low (LEM) and high (HEM) abundances of ectomycorrhizal trees in Korup National Park, Cameroon, over 26 months in 1990 92. Leaf litter was sorted into 26 abundant species which included six ectomycorrhizal species, and of these three were the large grove-forming trees Microberlinia bisulcata, Tetraberlinia bifoliolata and Tetraberlinia moreliana . Larger-tree species shed their leaves with pronounced peaks in the dry season, whereas other species had either weaker dependence, showed several peaks per year, or were wet-season shedders. Although total annual litterfall differed little between forest types, in the HEM forest (dominated by M. bisulcata) the dry-season peak was more pronounced and earlier than that in the LEM forest. Species differed greatly in their mean leaf litterfall nutrient concentrations, with an approx. twofold range for nitrogen and phosphorus, and 2.5-3.5-fold for potassium, magnesium and calcium. In the dry season, LEM and HEM litter showed similar declines in P and N concentration, and increases in K and Mg; some species, especially M. bisculcata, showed strong dry-wet season differences. The concentration of P (but not N) was higher in the leaf litter of ectomycorrhizal than nonectomycorrhizal species. Retranslocation of N and P was lower among the ectomycorrhizal than nonectomycorrhizal species by approx. twofold. It is suggested that, within ectomycorrhizal groves on this soil low in P, a fast decomposition rate with minimal loss of mineralized P is possible due to the relatively high litter P not limiting the cycle at this stage, combined with an efficient recapture of released P by the surface organic layer of ectomycorrhizas and fine roots. This points to a feedback between two essential controlling steps (retranslocation and mineralization) in a tropical rain forest ecosystem dominated bq ectomycorrhizal trees.

AB  - The dominance of ectomycorrhizae in most coniferous forest ecosystems profoundly alters the classical concept of the role of exudation and rhizodeposition of cell fragments in the formation of the rhizosphere. In the unaltered, non-ectomycorrhizal rhizosphere the soluble exudates and sloughed cells supporting higher populations of bacteria and other soil biota in the rhizosphere result from the root. The loss of root hairs and the presence of a sheath of fungal hyphae around roots in ectomycorrhizae, suggests that the exudates and sloughed cells will be mainly fungal in origin, creating a mycorrhizosphere. Unfortunately, very little quantitative data exist to test this hypothesis. Recent work has shown that much of the rhizodeposition is in fact whole roots and mycorrhizae; soluble exudates and root cap plus mucigel account for only 3-15% of the organic matter produced in pot experiments. In forests, 3-5 times more organic matter in the form of roots and mycorrhizae is returned to the soil than is returned by decomposition of litter. Data on biomass of bacteria, fungi and other mycorrhizosphere biota obtained by direct measurement or observation are very limited. Much of the research on interactions among biota has focused on host-pathogen interactions rather than quantification of the impact of biota on ecosystem processes. {\textcopyright} 1988.

AB  - The interactions of fungal guilds have recently been proposed as drivers of organic matter transformation in forest soils. We conducted a pot experiment with Norway spruce seedlings planted in spruce needle litter inoculated with several fungal strains belonging to different ecological guilds (saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, and root endophytic) to assess how the fungi and their interactions affect the transformation of humic substances (HS) and phosphorus (P) in the litter. Several methods for the characterization of P forms and HS were employed, including 31P NMR, UV–Vis and FTIR spectroscopy. Our results show that fungal interactions influence not only the flow of P in decaying (plant) litter but also the transformation of the soil organic matter itself. Pots with saprotrophic Gymnopus androsaceus generally retained more P and prevented the accumulation of phosphonates caused by mycorrhizal Hyaloscypha finlandica, highlighting the strong competitive ability of the former species. The increased mineralization of P caused by G. androsaceus was not observed in the combined treatments, suggesting that other present fungi took up part of the inorganic P. The tested fungi did not affect the amount of HS produced but changed the characteristics of the HS. Mycorrhizal H. finlandica and root endophytic Phialocephala fortinii increased the relative proportion of carboxylic moieties in the HS regardless of the presence or absence of G. androsaceus, probably via the production and incorporation of melanins. The UV–Vis absorbance characteristics of the HS were significantly influenced by fungal interactions. Mycorrhizal H. finlandica and Hebeloma bryogenes retarded humification, as determined by the A4/6 ratio. We attribute the similar shift observed in Serpula himantoides to the partial oxidative degradation of HS. Our study shows that fungal root endophytes can significantly contribute to litter transformation along with mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi. The extent and patterns of the transformation seem to be species-dependent in all studied fungal groups. {\textcopyright} 2020

AB  - In many forest ecosystems, fine root litter comprises a large pool of organic carbon and nutrients. In temperate climates ectomycorrhizal fungi colonize the roots of many forest plant species. If ectomycorrhizal colonization influenced root decomposition, it could significantly influence carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. Fungal tissues and fine roots may decompose at different rates and, therefore, ectomycorrhizal colonization may either hasten or retard root decomposition. Unfortunately, no comparisons of the decomposition of roots and ectomycorrhizal fungi have yet been made. Therefore, we compared decomposition of Pinus resinosa fine roots and ectomycorrhizal fungi from a Pinus resinosa plantation. We also compared the decomposition rates of nonmycorrhizal Pinus resinosa fine roots with roots colonized by nine species of ectomycorrhizal fungi. We found that the several tested isolates of ectomycorrhizal fungi decomposed far more rapidly than the fine roots and that ectomycorrhizal colonization either had no significant effect on root decomposition or significantly increased root decomposition depending on the isolate of fungus. We conclude that the composition of an ectomycorrhizal fungal community may affect carbon and nutrient cycling through its influence on root decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Traits are critical in predicting decomposition that fuels carbon and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. However, our understanding of root trait-decomposition linkage, and especially its dependence on mycorrhizal type and environmental context, remains limited. We explored the control of morphological and chemical (carbon- and nutrient-related) traits over decomposition of absorptive roots in 30 tree species associated with either arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi in temperate and subtropical forests in China. Carbon-related traits (acid-unhydrolysable residue (AUR) and cellulose concentrations) had predominant control of root decomposition in AM species while nutrient-related traits (magnesium concentration) predominately controlled that in ECM species. Thicker absorptive roots decomposed faster in AM species as a result of their lower AUR concentrations, but more slowly in ECM angiosperm species potentially as a result of their higher magnesium concentrations. Root decomposition was linked to root nutrient economy in both forests while root diameter-decomposition coordination emerged only in the subtropical forest where root diameter and decomposition presented similar cross-species variations. Our findings suggest that root trait-decomposition linkages differ strongly with mycorrhizal type and environment, and that root diameter can predict decomposition but in opposing directions and with contrasting mechanisms for AM and ECM species.

AB  - Patterns in the natural abundance of nitrogen (N) isotopes (15N and 14N) can help in the understanding of ecosystem processes along environmental gradients, because some processes fractionate against the heavier isotope. We measured $\delta$15N in many components of the Franz Josef soil chronosequence in New Zealand to see how each component varied along the sequence and within sites, and to see what this variation can tell us about how ecosystem processes such as N losses change with soil age. We analyzed $\delta$15N in foliage from 18 woody species, abscised leaves from seven woody species, three soil horizons, bryophytes, lichens, bulk deposition, and nodules from the N-fixing tree Coriaria arborea (Coriariaceae). Foliar $\delta$15N varied significantly across plant species. Foliage and bulk litter became 15N-depleted as soil age increased. Soil N from organic and mineral horizons was significantly more 15N-enriched than bulk litter N at each site. Increasing precipitation also decreased foliar and soil $\delta$15N. Comparing input and whole ecosystem $\delta$15N revealed limited evidence for net fractionation during N losses. These trends are consistent with some combination of increasing fractionation during plant N uptake, mycorrhizal transfer, within-plant processing, and soil decomposition as soils age. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

AB  - The ectomycorrhizal fungus Cenococcum geophilum (Ascomycota, Dothideomycetes) forms black, round to irregular sclerotia in forest soils. Fungi that colonize the sclerotia appear to affect sclerotia viability and may play an important role in the life history of Cenococcum. Some of the fungi could also affect nutrient cycling by decomposing Cenococcum sclerotia, which are melanized and recalcitrant to decay. We used a culture-based method to document the fungal communities growing inside surface-sterilized sclerotia that were collected from forest soils. Cenococcum was successfully isolated from 297 of 971 sclerotia whereas 427 sclerotia hosted fungi other than Cenococcum. DNA barcoding of the internal transcribed spacer rDNA followed by grouping at 97% sequence similarity yielded 85 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that consisted primarily of Ascomycota (e.g. Chaetothyriales, Eurotiales, Helotiales, Pleosporales) and a few Basidiomycota and Mucoromycotina. Although most fungal OTUs were infrequently cultured, several OTUs such as members of Asterostroma, Cladophialophora, Oidiodendron, and Pleosporales were common and found across many sites. Our results suggest that Cenococcum sclerotia act as a substrate for diverse fungi. The occurrence of several OTUs in sclerotia across many sites suggests that these fungi may be active parasites of Cenococcum sclerotia or may preferentially use sclerotia as a nutrient source. {\textcopyright} 2014 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB  - Soil extracellular enzymes catalyze the rate limiting steps of organic matter decomposition, and enzyme stoichiometry has been used to reflect microbial resource acquisition strategies. However, the patterns and key driving factors of soil enzyme activities and stoichiometry in subalpine forests, which are areas sensitive to global changes, remain unclear. In this study, rhizosphere and bulk soils along two environmental gradients in the subalpine forests of Gongga Mountain, in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, including (1) a horizontal chronosequence with different vegetation types but a similar climate and (2) a vertical elevation gradient with the same vegetation type but different climates, were sampled during the growing and nongrowing seasons. The activities and stoichiometry of soil enzymes related to the microbial acquisition of carbon (C) ($\beta$-1,4-glucosidase, BG), nitrogen (N) ($\beta$-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, NAG) and phosphorus (P) (acid phosphomonoesterase, AP) were analyzed to reveal their responses to environmental gradients. The results showed that enzyme activities and stoichiometry varied significantly among vegetation types, but were less affected by climate and root proximity. BG activity and ratios of BG to nutrient-acquiring enzymes were significantly higher in broadleaf forests than in coniferous forests. The differences in enzyme stoichiometry between vegetation types were weakly related to the microbial nutrient status (represented by the ratio of soil to microbial element stoichiometry) but might be explained by the higher proportion of ectomycorrhizal fungi in coniferous forests compared to broadleaf forests. The results of this study indicate that vegetation type was a major factor regulating soil enzyme activities and stoichiometry in the subalpine forests, possibly via its influences on plant-associated microbial communities. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the ecology of coniferous forests is very important because these environments represent globally largest carbon sinks. Metatranscriptomics, microbial community and enzyme analyses were combined to describe the detailed role of microbial taxa in the functioning of the Picea abies-dominated coniferous forest soil in two contrasting seasons. These seasons were the summer, representing the peak of plant photosynthetic activity, and late winter, after an extended period with no photosynthate input. The results show that microbial communities were characterized by a high activity of fungi especially in litter where their contribution to microbial transcription was over 50%. Differences in abundance between summer and winter were recorded for 26-33% of bacterial genera and <15% of fungal genera, but the transcript profiles of fungi, archaea and most bacterial phyla were significantly different among seasons. Further, the seasonal differences were larger in soil than in litter. Most importantly, fungal contribution to total microbial transcription in soil decreased from 33% in summer to 16% in winter. In particular, the activity of the abundant ectomycorrhizal fungi was reduced in winter, which indicates that plant photosynthetic production was likely one of the major drivers of changes in the functioning of microbial communities in this coniferous forest. {\textcopyright} 2016 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Tree growth in boreal forests is limited by nitrogen (N) availability. Most boreal forest trees form symbiotic associations with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which improve the uptake of inorganic N and also have the capacity to decompose soil organic matter (SOM) and to mobilize organic N (‘ECM decomposition'). To study the effects of ‘ECM decomposition' on ecosystem carbon (C) and N balances, we performed a sensitivity analysis on a model of C and N flows between plants, SOM, saprotrophs, ECM fungi, and inorganic N stores. The analysis indicates that C and N balances were sensitive to model parameters regulating ECM biomass and decomposition. Under low N availability, the optimal C allocation to ECM fungi, above which the symbiosis switches from mutualism to parasitism, increases with increasing relative involvement of ECM fungi in SOM decomposition. Under low N conditions, increased ECM organic N mining promotes tree growth but decreases soil C storage, leading to a negative correlation between C stores above- and below-ground. The interplay between plant production and soil C storage is sensitive to the partitioning of decomposition between ECM fungi and saprotrophs. Better understanding of interactions between functional guilds of soil fungi may significantly improve predictions of ecosystem responses to environmental change. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The symbiosis between plants and Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) is shown to considerably influence the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes between the soil, rhizosphere, and plants in boreal forest ecosystems. However, ECM are either neglected or presented as an implicit, undynamic term in most ecosystem models, which can potentially reduce the predictive power of models.</p><p classCombining double low line"p">In order to investigate the necessity of an explicit consideration of ECM in ecosystem models, we implement the previously developed MYCOFON model into a detailed process-based, soil-plant-atmosphere model, Coup-MYCOFON, which explicitly describes the C and N fluxes between ECM and roots. This new Coup-MYCOFON model approach (ECM explicit) is compared with two simpler model approaches: one containing ECM implicitly as a dynamic uptake of organic N considering the plant roots to represent the ECM (ECM implicit), and the other a static N approach in which plant growth is limited to a fixed N level (nonlim). Parameter uncertainties are quantified using Bayesian calibration in which the model outputs are constrained to current forest growth and soil Cg•N ratio for four forest sites along a climate and N deposition gradient in Sweden and simulated over a 100-year period.</p><p classCombining double low line"p">The nonlim approach could not describe the soil Cg•N ratio due to large overestimation of soil N sequestration but simulate the forest growth reasonably well. The ECM implicit and explicit approaches both describe the soil Cg•N ratio well but slightly underestimate the forest growth. The implicit approach simulated lower litter production and soil respiration than the explicit approach. The ECM explicit Coup-MYCOFON model provides a more detailed description of internal ecosystem fluxes and feedbacks of C and N between plants, soil, and ECM. Our modeling highlights the need to incorporate ECM and organic N uptake into ecosystem models, and the nonlim approach is not recommended for future long-term soil C and N predictions. We also provide a key set of posterior fungal parameters that can be further investigated and evaluated in future ECM studies. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) is the chief coniferous species used in forest plantations in northern China. However, high tree density and slow rates of decomposition in needle litter have resulted in decreased quality in many plantations. Thinning provides an effective method which can be used to solve this problem. The mechanisms by which thinning promotes litter decomposition have been studied by studying properties of litter, characteristics of understory vegetation, forest microclimate and physicochemical properties of soil, but rarely by studying the important role fungi play in forest litter decomposition. Thus, discovering the relationships between thinning, fungi, and litter decomposition in plantations is very important. It has been hypothesized that forest microclimates improve after thinning, since thinning promotes growth of understory vegetation; this changes stand composition and properties of litter, which in turn affects the macrofungi community. This study analyzes a series of 34-year-old Chinese pine plantations thinned to four different intensities (control-I, light-II, medium-III, and heavy thinning intensity-IV). All macrofungi were identified morphologically and measurements of each species such as quantity, cap diameter and fungal height were made in 12 sample plots. Importance values were calculated using relative density, relative frequency, relative cap diameter and relative height of fungi. The ecological indices (species richness, diversity and evenness) of macrofungi were calculated based on the important values and compared between August and September, 2011. A total of 35 and 25 species belonging to 13 and 10 families of macrofungi were found in August and September, respectively. During the two months of studies, stands with medium thinning intensity supported the highest number of species, but the control stand supported the fewest. The number of species found in September was lower than those found in August possibly because the temperature decreased in September. In the control-I stands, the dominant species changed from ectomycorrhizal fungi (Chroogomphis rutilus (Schaeff.: Fr.) O. K. Miller and Suillus bovinus (Pers.) Kuntze) in August to rot fungi (Marasmius maximus Hongo and Marasmius chordalis Fr.) in September. This change may have occurred because ectomycorrhizal fungi reproduce during August, but they rarely grew in September. However, in treatments II, III and IV, the dominant species were rot fungi during the entire study. Rot fungi are generally known to feed on litter as a nutrient source. Thus, the change of dominant species from ectomycorrhizal fungi-rot fungi (control) to rot fungi (treatment II, III and IV) may be explained by the fact thinning improves litter decomposition from the aspect of causing increased fungal populations. Thinning influenced the ecological indices of macrofungi; the stands with medium thinning intensity (III) had the highest species richness and diversity. This indicates moderate thinning had a significant role in protecting macrofungi resources in plantation soils. The measure of species evenness was not significantly different among the four different thinning intensities. The abundant quantity of saprophytic fungi might cause the trend for the evenness indices to be uniform. In conclusion, a medium thinning intensity improves species richness and diversity of macrofungi in Chinese pine plantations, changes the macrofungi community structure, and may promote litter decomposition. Thus, we recommend moderate thinning should be used in plantations of Chinese pine.

AB  - Roots of forest trees are associated with various ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal species that are involved in nutrient exchange between host plant and the soil compartment. The identification of ECM fungi in small environmental samples is difficult. The present study tested the feasibility of attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy followed by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) to discriminate in situ collected ECM fungal species. Root tips colonized by distinct ECM fungal species, i.e., Amanita rubescens, Cenococcum geophilum, Lactarius subdulcis, Russula ochroleuca, and Xerocomus pruinatus were collected in mono-specific beech (Fagus sylvatica) and mixed deciduous forests in different geographic areas to investigate the environmental variability of the ECM FTIR signatures. A clear HCA discrimination was obtained for ECM fungal species independent of individual provenance. Environmental variability neither limited the discrimination between fungal species nor provided sufficient resolution to discern species sub-clusters for different sites. However, the de-convoluted FTIR spectra contained site-related spectral information for fungi with wide nutrient ranges, but not for Lactarius subdulcis, a fungus residing only in the litter layer. Specific markers for distinct ECM were identified in spectral regions associated with carbohydrates (i.e., mannans), lipids, and secondary protein structures. The present results support that FTIR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate analysis is a reliable and fast method to identify ECM fungal species in minute environmental samples. Moreover, our data suggest that the FTIR spectral signatures contain information on physiological and functional traits of ECM fungi. {\textcopyright} 2014 Pena, Lang, Naumann and Polle.

AB  - Plants and soil microbes produce extracellular enzymes (EE) that catalyze the hydrolysis of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) containing compounds in soil and other enzymes involved in degradation of lignin and cellulose. We explored whether soil enzyme activity involved in carbon (C), N and P cycling were correlated with plant distribution, soil chemical conditions and the identity of fungi colonizing tree roots in an old growth forest remnant. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) was used to determine the presence of root fungi and standard fluorometric analysis was used to determine soil enzyme activities. Soil enzymes were consistently positively correlated with soil C and N, but not CN ratio. Soil P was also correlated with enzyme activity during both June and September sampling. We saw no significant relationships between herbaceous plant cover and enzyme activity in June, but there were significant positive correlations between $\alpha$-glucosidase and herbaceous plant coverage in September. We also found that some enzymes were significantly correlated with the identity of fungi colonizing tree roots separated from the soil cores. Chitinase and $\beta$-glucosidase were positively correlated with the genera Russula and Piloderma while chitinase was negatively correlated with Amanita and Entoloma. In addition, phosphatase was positively correlated with Russula, Meliniomyces and Solenopezia. Our results suggest that enzyme activity in old growth forest soils are affected by a variety of environmental factors, and that herbaceous plants and some root fungi may be associated with sites of elevated or decreased decomposition potential and nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Survival and productivity of Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] depend on close association between host trees and ectomycorrhizal fungi. Two of these fungi, Hysterangium setchellii (Fischer) and Gautieria monticola (Harkness), form extensive hyphal mats with the roots of Douglas-fir and other conifers in the surface of the 'A' horizon, often at the interface between mineral oil and litter. The fungal mat alters the chemistry and mineral nutrition of the soil microenvironment within the rhizosphere, producing conditions that favor increased tree growth by increasing nutrient availability. Forest soils with or without obvious ectomycorrhizal mats were sampled at two locations in the Pacific Northwest. Cation and anion chemistry, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and oxalate anions were analyzed. Mean concentrations of DOC, oxalate, PO4, SO4, H, Al, Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn were significantly higher in mat than in non-mat soil solutions in both mat types and locations and on both sampling dates. Significant statistical correlations between DOC or oxalate and PO4 indicate that organic acids influence weathering and solubility of PO4 in the mat soils. Mean oxalate concentrations were significantly lower in soil solutions from Hysterangium mat soils than in those from Gautieria mat soils. Organic acids released to the rhizosphere by G. monilcola and H. setchellii may provide a local weathering environment that increases availability of PO4, SO4 and trace nutrients. {\textcopyright} 1994.

AB  - The ectomycorrhizal community of an oak forest has been monitored monthly throughout fifteen months. Eight enzymatic activities secreted by the ectomycorrhizal root tips and involved in the mobilization of nutrients from soil organic matter have been measured using microplate assays, resulting in potential activity patterns of individual fungal species. Both the species structure of the community and the specific activity level of each individual species changed with the season and soil horizon. This versatility may be an adaptative response of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community to a highly variable environment. The results also suggest that some ectomycorrhizal fungi behave as occasional saprobes and contribute to the decomposition of soil organic matter and nutrient cycling together with true saprotrophic fungi.

AB  - Clearcut logging results in major changes in ectomycorrhizal fungal communities, but whether this results in the loss of key functional traits, such as those associated with nutrient acquisition from soil organic matter, is unknown. Furthermore, little is known about the importance of resource partitioning in structuring ectomycorrhizal fungal communities following disturbance because most research on these communities has focussed on life history strategies. By studying functional traits, such as activities of enzymes involved in the catabolism of organic macromolecules in soil, we can determine whether a physiological potential for resource partitioning exists in pioneer ectomycorrhizal communities and whether severe disturbance affects these important ecosystem services. We used activities of key hydrolytic enzymes in the ectomycorrhizospheres of Douglas-fir seedlings regenerating at clearcut sites as a functional trait to test whether these differed from those at recent wildfire sites or control forests. We sampled the most abundant types of ectomycorrhizas from 16-month-old seedlings from sites exposed to (i) low or (ii) high severity wildfire, (iii) sites that had been clearcut logged in the same year as the fire and (iv) sites that contained control stands of mature Douglas-fir. We expected differences in activities among ectomycorrhizas sampled from different disturbance treatments and among those formed by different fungal species. In spite of large differences in soil chemistry, activities of acid phosphomonoesterase, N-acetylglucosaminidase and $\beta$-glucosidase, when averaged among the ectomycorrhizas sampled per site, were not affected by disturbance agent. However, activities varied up to sixfold among mycorrhizospheres of different fungal species on the same seedling. Multivariate analysis also indicated some consistent differences in enzyme profiles among ectomycorrhizas formed by specific fungal species, independent of treatment. The finding that ectomycorrhizal fungal communities exposed to different disturbance agents are functionally similar with respect to the activities of three mycorrhizosphere enzymes supports the conclusion that complementarity exists among ectomycorrhizal fungi. The substantial physiological diversity among ectomycorrhizal fungi at the scale of an individual seedling's root tips, especially at control mature forests, indicates the potential for resource partitioning within the ectomycorrhizal community and access to a wider range of nutrient sources by each seedling. Functional similarity among ectomycorrhizal fungal communities across a disturbance severity gradient suggests that dry interior Douglas-fir forests are resilient to severe disturbances such as high severity wildfire and clearcutting with forest floor removal. Moreover, our results suggest that current harvesting practices emulate natural disturbances with respect to site-level mycorrhizosphere enzyme activity. The large variation in activity among fungal species, however, indicates that a substantial simplification of the fungal community through other perturbations, as expected with climate change, has the potential to affect ecosystem function. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Soil respiration, i.e. respiration by mycorrhizal roots and by heterotrophic organisms decomposing above- and below-ground litters, is a major component in ecosystem carbon (C) balances. For decades, the paradigm has been that the biomass of fine roots of trees turns over several times a year, which together with large inputs of above-ground litter leaves little room for the contribution from root respiration. Here, we combine the results of a recent tree girdling experiment with the C budget of the classic Swedish Coniferous Forest (SWECON) project, in which root growth and turnover were estimated to be high. We observe that such a high rate of root turnover requires an unlikely high C use efficiency for root growth, and is not consistent with the 1:1 relation between root: heterotrophic respiration obtained in the girdling experiment. Our analysis suggests that 75\% of the C allocated to roots is respired, while 25\% is used for growth, and hence that root growth and turnover were grossly overestimated in the SWECON study.

AB  - Understanding the factors that structure soil microbial communities and their relative importance in determining local community assemblages is fundamental to understanding how human activities, such as forest management, may impact soil ecosystems. We studied fungal communities in soil and litter under multiple sites dominated by spruce, beech and oak in a central European forest ecosystem to further understand the relative importance of vegetation and abiotic variables within a temperate forest. We sampled four times over a one-year period to determine if fungal community composition varied over time and whether the determination of driving factors was temporally dependent. We found that fungal community composition differed between litter and soil and among stand types but that community structure (richness, functional-guilds) was similar. In litter communities, composition was strongly coupled to dominant tree species; while in soil communities, both dominant tree and abiotic variables such as pH were important - with each variable explaining a separable portion of the variation in the fungal community composition. Further analyses showed that the relative importance of dominant tree species and abiotic drivers differed among functional groups subsets of the community. Across our sampled sites, both the litter and soil communities of a given stand type were well-characterized by a set of low-abundance indicator species with consistent presence, regardless of location, suggesting stand type is an important local filter on the occurrence of these taxa within the spatial context of our study (100 km2). The marked difference in annual leaf break and leaf fall between coniferous and deciduous stands were not found to correlate with temporal changes in fungal community composition; however, a time-dependent trend was found across all soil communities and among all soil functional-group subsets regardless of the dominant tree type. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although soil microorganisms play a critical role in soil organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling and ecosystem productivity, we still know very little about how microbial communities are affected by environmental factors and how the structure and function of soil microbial communities influence key soil processes, especially for the arid and semi-arid river valley district. Studies focusing on soil microbial communities under this region are still under-represented when compared to moist forest and grassland ecosystems. Thus, the objectives of this work were to quantify the effects of shrubs on soil physicochemical properties and microbial composition (Phospholipid fatty acid, PLFA), and to find out soil factors that significantly affect soil microbial composition. To achieve this, we investigated the variations of soil properties between dominant shrubs and shrub-interspaces at a set of sites along the mountainous semi-arid valley of the upper Minjiang River, Sichuan Province. The dominant shrubs had significant effects on soil physicochemical properties and microbial composition, while the effects of shrub species seem to be trivial. The soil under shrub canopies had more organic carbon and nutrient resources, higher water content and lower bulk density than those of the shrub-interspaces. The bacterial communities' abundance did not vary significantly between the two types of soil, while fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) tended to dominate under shrubs. Furthermore, the correlation based Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated a clear dissimilarity of microbial community composition and physicochemical properties between shrub and shrub-interspace soils. Besides, the PCA revealed that the microbial community composition was a more sensitive and effective indicator than soil physiochemical properties in this study. Backward selection procedure and the combined redundancy analysis (RDA) were used to select the most important soil physiochemical variables affecting soil microbial communities. Though the main factors varied among the four sites, the nitrogen (N) associated factors (Total N, Available N and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio) always played a pivotal role in structuring the microbial groups, especially total microbial biomass (total PLFA) and the bacterial groups (Gran-positive (G+), Gran-negative (G−), general bacteria (B), and cyclo bacteria (cyclo)). The correlation between fungi groups (fungi, AMF) and N associated factors was relatively weak. Total phosphorus and carbon-to-phosphorus ratio strongly affected the fungi and AMF groups in Feihong and Mutuo. This may indicate the importance of phosphorus in shaping fungi and AMF communities, as well as the indispensable role that fungi and AMF communities may play in influencing phosphorus availability and cycling. In addition, soil water content exerted effects on the microbial composition in the two relative humid sites, Cuoji and Mutuo. Moreover, pH did not significantly affect microbial communities, though previous studies have pointed out its important role in affecting microbial composition. This may be due to the small variation of pH in this semi-arid river valley. Collectively, the enrichment of soil nutrients and better physical condition under shrub canopies were the main reasons for the difference of microbial community composition between shrubs and shrub-interspaces. Our work demonstrated the important role of shrubs in the semi-arid valley of upper Minjiang River, and provided insights into the nutrient cycling of semi-arid valley. It also revealed the importance of nitrogen and phosphorus for bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. Future studies on the plant-soil relationship in dryland ecosystems should pay more attention to fungi and AMF communities. {\textcopyright} 2015, Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.

AB  - Boreal forests are distributed in a circumpolar belt between the temperate broadleaf forests to the south and the arctic tundra to the north. Ultimately, boreal forests were shaped by the recent glaciation, with young soils on magmatic bedrock, in combination with short growing seasons and a cold climate. Low temperatures, combined with generally acidic soils, leads to slow decomposition of organic matter and low rates of nitrogen input via fixation. The resulting accumulation of nutrients in organic soil pools restricts recirculation to plants, and ecosystem production is generally constrained by low nitrogen availability. A complete dependency of boreal forest on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associates is supported by the observation that, in habitats where harsh conditions constrain the proliferation of cord-forming ECM fungi, forests gradually retrogress into low-productive ecosystems that more resemble heathlands than forests. The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis expands the boundaries for boreal forest by facilitating establishment in habitats that otherwise would be heathland or tundra. {\textcopyright} 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Introduction Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) form symbioses with forest trees. These fungi are mainly basidiomycetes and ascomycetes and they probably evolved from saprotrophic fungi when organic matter began to accumulate in certain soils 200 million years ago (Cairney, 2000). The tree host benefits from the symbiosis through improved nutrient acquisition since the fungus explores the soil efficiently for nutrients (especially N and P) in return for host carbon (Smith & Read, 1997). Forest trees with ectomycorrhiza usually dominate in acidic soils with thick litter layers, with the associated EMF forming extensive external mycelia with a high capacity to take up nutrients from the soil. The fungi form mantles around the root tips with large storage capacities (Read, 1991). The trees invest large amounts of carbon in the ectomycorrhizal (EM) symbionts, especially under nutrient-poor conditions, with up to 20%of photosynthetic assimilates allocated to the mycorrhizal symbionts (Finlay & S{\"{o}}derstr{\"{o}}m, 1992). This large carbon source for EMF gives them an advantage over nonsymbiotic microorganisms in the soil ecosystem since these are usually carbon-limited (Ald{\'{e}}n et al., 2001). The importance of current photosynthate for soil processes was recently demonstrated by H{\"{o}}gberg et al. (2001), who girdled trees in northern Sweden and found a rapid reduction in soil respiration of more than 50% within 1-2 months. More precise calculations the second year after girdling demonstrated that 65% of total respiration was contributed by EM roots, their associated EMF and other rhizosphere microorganisms (Bhupinderpal-Singh et al., 2003).

AB  - Plant growth in boreal forests is commonly limited by a low supply of nitrogen, a condition that may be aggravated by high tree below-ground allocation of carbon to ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi and associated microorganisms. These in turn immobilise N and reduce its availability to plants as boreal ecosystems develop. Here, we studied a boreal forest ecosystem chronosequence created by new land rising out of the sea due to iso-static rebound along the coast of northern Sweden. We used height over the ocean to estimate ecosystem age and examined its relationship to soil microbial community structure and the gross turnover of N. The youngest soils develop with meadows by the coast, followed by a zone of N2-fixing alder trees, and primary boreal conifer forest on ground up to 560 years old. The young soils in meadows contained little organic matter and microbial biomass per unit area. Nitrogen was turned over at low rates when expressed per area (m(-2)), but specific rates (per gram soil carbon (C)) were the highest found along the transect. In the zone with alder, the amounts of soil C and microbial biomass were much higher (bacterial biomass had doubled and fungal biomass quadrupled). Rates of gross N mineralisation (expressed on an area basis) were highest, but the retention of added labelled NH4+ was lowest in this soil as compared to other ages. The alder zone also had the largest extractable pools of inorganic N in soil and highest N \% in plant foliage. In the older conifer forest ecosystems the amounts of soil C and N, as well as biomass of both bacteria and fungi increased. Data on organic matter C-14 suggested that the largest input of recently fixed plant C occurred in the younger coniferous forest ecosystems. With increasing ecosystem age, the ratio of microbial C to total soil C was constant, whereas the ratio of microbial N to total soil N increased and gross N mineralization declined. Simultaneously, plant foliar N \% decreased and the natural abundance of N-15 in the soil increased. More specifically, the difference in delta N-15 between plant foliage and soil increased, which is related to relatively greater retention of N-15 relative to N-14 by ECM fungi as N is taken up from the soil and some N is transferred to the plant host. In the conifer forest, where these changes were greatest, we found increased fungal biomass in the F- and H-horizons of the mor-layer, in which ECM fungi are known to dominate (the uppermost horizon with litter and moss is dominated by saprotrophic fungi). Hence, we propose that the decreasing availability of N to the plants and the subsequent decline in plant production in ageing boreal forests is linked to high tree belowground C allocation to ECM fungi, a strong microbial sink for available soil N.

AB  - Quantifying pathways and temporal dynamics of carbon (C) flux between plants and soil is critical to our understanding of the long-term fate of C stored in soils. The potential priming of old organic matter decomposition by fresh C input from plants means that the impact of environmental changes on the interactions between plant C allocation and soil C storage need to be better understood. We used forest girdling to investigate the partitioning of total soil CO2 efflux (RS) into autotrophic (RA) and heterotrophic (RH) flux components and their interaction with litter decomposition. The reduction in RS in girdled plots stabilized within two weeks at 65% of control plot values, indicating that RS is dominated by RH, and that only a small pool of available non-structural C remains in roots in late summer to sustain rhizosphere metabolic processes. RA contributions declined from 35% late in the growing season to about 25% in winter. Our results indicate that actual root respiration (RR) and respiration by ectyomycorrhizas and other rhizospheric organisms (RM) contribute c. 50% each to RA between September and early November. During winter, RA remained significantly greater than zero despite frequent sub-zero air temperatures, with RM being a dominant component of RA during this period. Forest girdling significantly increased the age of C in soil-respired CO2, consistent with the removal of contemporary C derived from RA. Partitioning of soil CO2 efflux on the basis of 14C results shows good agreement with the flux reduction observed between girdled and control plots. Litter bag incubations indicate a promoting influence of an intact C supply to the rhizosphere on decomposition, indicating a positive rhizosphere priming effect. Synthesis: Our results demonstrate significant contribution of mycorrhizas and other rhizosphere organisms to RS, and suggest a direct link between an intact rhizosphere and litter decomposition dynamics. These results highlight the tight coupling between autotroph activity and soil decomposition processes in forest soils, and add to the growing body of evidence that plant and soil processes cannot be treated separately. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Three different approaches were used to calculate heterotrophic soil respiration (Rh) and soil carbon dynamics in an old-growth deciduous forest in central Germany. A root and mycorrhiza exclosure experiment in the field separated auto- and heterotrophic soil respiration. It was compared to modeled heterotrophic respiration resulting from two different approaches: a modular component model of soil respiration calculated autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration with litter, climate and canopy photosynthesis as input variables. It was calibrated by independent soil respiration measurements in the field. A second model was calibrated by incubation of soil samples from different soil layers in the laboratory. In this case, the annual sum of Rh was calculated by an empirical model including response curves to temperature and a soil moisture. The three approaches showed good accordance during spring and summer and when the annual sums of Rh calculated by the two models were compared. Average Rh for the years 2002-2006 were 436 g C m-2 year-1 (field model) and 417 g C m-2 year-1 (lab-model), respectively. Differences between the approaches revealed specific limitations of each method. The average carbon balance of the Hainich forest soil was estimated to be between 1 and 35 g C m-2 year-1 depending on the model used and the averaging period. A comparison with nighttime data from eddy covariance (EC) showed that EC data were lower than modelled soil respiration in many situations. We conclude that better filter methods for EC nighttime data have to be developed. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).

AB  - Basidiomycete fungi subsist on various types of plant material in diverse environments, from living and dead trees and forest litter to crops and grasses and to decaying plant matter in soils. Due to the variation in their natural carbon sources, basidiomycetes have highly varied plant-polysaccharide-degrading capabilities. This topic is not as well studied for basidiomycetes as for ascomycete fungi, which are the main sources of knowledge on fungal plant polysaccharide degradation. Research on plant-biomass-decaying fungi has focused on isolating enzymes for current and future applications, such as for the production of fuels, the food industry, and waste treatment. More recently, genomic studies of basidiomycete fungi have provided a profound view of the plant-bio-mass-degrading potential of wood-rotting, litter-decomposing, plant-pathogenic, and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) basidiomycetes. This review summarizes the current knowledge on plant polysaccharide depolymerization by basidiomycete species from diverse habitats. In addition, these data are compared to those for the most broadly studied ascomycete genus, Aspergillus, to provide insight into specific features of basidiomycetes with respect to plant polysaccharide degradation.

AB  - Reviews the major biogeochemical inputs and pathways in Australian rain forest ecosystems, indicating the significance of rainfall and dust decomposition, nitrogen fixation and rock weathering. Major biogeochemical losses occur as a result of surface runoff which transports topsoil and leaf litter into streams, and through denitrification. Major nutrient exchanges occur as a result of throughfall and stemflow, litterfall, litter decomposition and nutrient incorporation into plant biomass. Nutrient conserving mechanisms include translocation of nutrients, foliar uptake, uptake by tree and leaf epiphytes, development of aerial roots, large root masses and the presence of mycorrhizal hyphae close to or amongst decomposing litter. Logging, storms, forest clearing and burning can also affect nutrient cycling. The introduction of an entirely new community of species which can tolerate impoverished soil may be necessary to re-establish the biomass nutrient pools and nutrient cycles. -S.J.Yates

AB  - Interactions between symbiotic ectomycorrhizal (EM) and free-living saprotrophs can result in significant deceleration of leaf litter decomposition. While this phenomenon is widely cited, its generality remains unclear, as both the direction and magnitude of EM fungal effects on leaf litter decomposition have been shown to vary among studies. Here we explicitly examine how contrasting leaf litter types and EM fungal communities may lead to differential effects on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Specifically, we measured the response of soil nutrient cycling, litter decay rates, litter chemistry and fungal community structure to the reduction of EM fungi (via trenching) with a reciprocal litter transplant experiment in adjacent Pinus- or Quercus-dominated sites. We found clear evidence of EM fungal suppression of C and N cycling in the Pinus-dominated site, but no suppression in the Quercus-dominated site. Additionally, in the Pinus-dominated site, only the Pinus litter decay rates were decelerated by EM fungi and were associated with decoupling of litter C and N cycling. Our results support the hypothesis that EM fungi can decelerate C cycling via N competition, but strongly suggest that the ‘Gadgil effect' is dependent on both substrate quality and EM fungal community composition. We argue that understanding tree host traits as well as EM fungal functional diversity is critical to a more mechanistic understanding of how EM fungi mediate forest soil biogeochemical cycling. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Current theory expects that fungi, on the one hand, are spatially ubiquitous but, on the other, are more susceptible than bacteria to disturbance such as land use change due to dispersal limitations. This study examined the relative importance of location and land use effects in determining soil fungal community composition in south-eastern Australia. We use terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP; primer pair ITS1-F-ITS4) and multivariate statistical methods (NMDS ordinations, ANOSIM tests) to compare relative similarities of soil fungal communities from nine sites encompassing three locations (ca 50-200 km apart) and four land uses (native eucalypt forest, Pinus radiata plantation, Eucalyptus globulus plantation, and unimproved pasture). Location effects were generally weak (e.g. ANOSIM test statistic R <= 0.49) and were, in part, attributed to minor differences in soil texture. By contrast, we found clear and consistent evidence of land use effects on soil fungal community composition (R <= 0.95). That is, soils from sites of the same land use grouped together in NMDS ordinations of fungal composition despite geographic separations of up to ca 175 km (native eucalypt forests) and 215 km (P. radiata plantations). In addition, different land. uses from the same location were clearly separate in NMDS ordinations, despite, in one case, being just 180 m apart and having similar land use histories (i.e. P. radiata versus E. globulus plantation both established on pasture in the previous decade). Given negligible management of all sites beyond the early establishment phase, we attribute much of the land use effects to changes in dominant plant species based on consistent evidence elsewhere of strong specificity in pine and eucalypt mycorrhizal associations. In addition, weak to moderate correlations between soil fungal community composition and soil chemical variables (e.g. Spearman rank correlation coefficients for individual variables of 0.08-0.32), indicated a minor contributing role of vegetation-mediated changes in litter and soil chemistry. Our data provide evidence of considerable plasticity in soil fungal community composition over time spans as short as 6-11 years. This suggests that - at least within geographic zones characterised by more-or-less contiguous forest cover - soil fungal community composition depends most on availability of suitable habitat because dispersal propagules are readily available for colonisation after land use change.

AB  - • Constraints on plant growth imposed by low availability of nitrogen are a characteristic feature of ecosystems dominated by ectomycorrhizal plants. Ectomycorrhizal fungi play a key role in the N nutrition of plants, allowing their host plants to access decomposition products of dead plant and animal materials. Ectomycorrhizal plants are thus able to compensate for the low availability of inorganic N in forest ecosystems. • The capacity to take up peptides, as well as the transport mechanisms involved, were analysed in the ectomycorrhizal fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum. • The present study demonstrated that H. cylindrosporum mycelium was able to take up di- and tripeptides and use them as sole N source. Two peptide transporters (HcPTR2A and B) were isolated by yeast functional complementation using an H. cylindrosporum cDNA library, and were shown to mediate dipeptide uptake. • Uptake capacities and expression regulation of both genes were analysed, indicating that HcPTR2A was involved in the high-efficiency peptide uptake under conditions of limited N availability, whereas HcPTR2B was expressed constitutively. {\textcopyright} New Phytologist (2006).

AB  - As mycorrhizal fungi, endophytic fungi are ubiquitous in natural forest ecosystems. A great number of foliar endophytic fungi (FEFs) have been isolated from leaves of forest trees, and some metabolites are also isolated and characterized from the FEFs. These metabolites show strong potential to inhibit or kill insects and pathogenic fungi, especially those causing decline or damage of forest trees. In addition, FEFs can inhabit in leaf litter for a short or long period depending on endophytic species, thus they affect decomposition rate of leaf litter. Some FEFs can colonize in plant roots and promote plant growth. In the review, we provide an overview of the ecological roles of FEFs and hope the resources of FEFs can be developed and be used in forestry and agriculture to reduce use of insectcides and fungicides and in pharmacology to maintain human health. {\textcopyright} 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Activities of extracellular enzymes were determined in beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) leaf litter colonized by the litter decomposer Lepista nuda (Bull. : Fr.) Cooke or by vegetative mycelium from the mycorrhizal fungi Thelephora terrestris Ehrh.: Fr. or Suillus bovinus (L.: Fr.) O. Kuntze. Organic matter (OM) was buried for up to 6 months in plant containers in which mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal Pinus sylvestris L. seedlings were cultivated at a low rate of nutrient addition. After different periods of colonization the activities of phosphomonoesterase and protease, two enzymes involved in nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization, were determined in colonized and uncolonized litter. The activities of cellulase, $\beta$-xylosidase, $\beta$-glucosidase and polyphenol oxidase were investigated as indicators of the decomposition capacity of the fungi in the litter. Low activities of all enzymes tested were found in the uncolonized beech leaves. Phosphomonoesterase activity was high in litter colonized with L. nuda or S. bovinus, and was intermediate in the T. terrestris treatment. For all other enzymes the activities in the OM inoculated with the white-rot litter decomposer were considerably larger than those detected in litter colonized by ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes. Cellulase activity was low in the control as well as in the mycorrhizal treatments. $\beta$-Xylosidase and $\beta$-glucosidase were detected in the litter with mycorrhizal mycelium, whereas polyphenol oxidase activity was only clearly increased in the S. bovinus treatment. These results demonstrate the low lignocellulase activity of both mycorrhizal fungi. This feature reduces the capacity of the mycorrhizal fungi to exploit fresh beech leaf litter, whose endogenous nitrogen is associated with or shielded by refractory compounds. The results are discussed in relation to the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in nutrient cycling processes in temperate forest ecosystems.

AB  - Ectomycorrhiza (EM) formation improves tree growth and nutrient acquisition, particularly that of nitrogen (N). Few studies have coupled the effects of naturally occurring EM morphotypes to the nutrition of host trees. To investigate this, pine seedlings were grown on raw humus substrates collected at two forest sites, R2 and R3. Ectomycorrhiza morphotypes were identified, and their respective N uptake rates from organic (2- 13C, 15N-glycine) and inorganic ( 15NH 4Cl, Na 15NO 3, 15NH 4NO 3, NH4 15NO3) sources as well as their phosphate uptake rates were determined. Subsequently, the growth and nutritional status of the seedlings were analyzed. Two dominant EM morphotypes displayed significantly different mycorrhization rates in the two substrates. Rhizopogon luteolus Fr. (RL) was dominant in R2 and Suillus bovinus (Pers.) Kuntze (SB) was dominant in R3. 15N uptake of RL EM was at all times higher than that of SB EM. Phosphate uptake rates by the EM morphotypes did not differ significantly. The number of RL EM correlated negatively and the number of SB EM correlated positively with pine growth rate. Increased arginine concentrations and critical P/N ratios in needles indicated nutrient imbalances of pine seedlings from humus R2, predominantly mycorrhizal with RL. We conclude that different N supply in raw humus under Scots pine stands can induce shifts in the EM frequency of pine seedlings, and this may lead to EM formation by fungal strains with different ability to support tree growth. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author.

AB  - There is growing evidence of the importance of extramatrical mycelium (EMM) of mycorrhizal fungi in carbon (C) cycling in ecosystems. However, our understanding has until recently been mainly based on laboratory experiments, and knowledge of such basic parameters as variations in mycelial production, standing biomass and turnover as well as the regulatory mechanisms behind such variations in forest soils is limited. Presently, the production of EMM by ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi has been estimated at $\sim$140 different forest sites to be up to several hundreds of kg per ha per year, but the published data are biased towards Picea abies in Scandinavia. Little is known about the standing biomass and turnover of EMM in other systems, and its influence on the C stored or lost from soils. Here, focussing on ectomycorrhizas, we discuss the factors that regulate the production and turnover of EMM and its role in soil C dynamics, identifying important gaps in this knowledge. C availability seems to be the key factor determining EMM production and possibly its standing biomass in forests but direct effects of mineral nutrient availability on the EMM can be important. There is great uncertainty about the rate of turnover of EMM. There is increasing evidence that residues of EM fungi play a major role in the formation of stable N and C in SOM, which highlights the need to include mycorrhizal effects in models of global soil C stores. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).

Biodiversitas 17: 592-603. Roots of orchids have important role for survival, adaptation, water and nutrient absorption, and as a place of symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi. The present study aimed to investigate the morphology, anatomy, and mycorrhizal status in roots of orchids of Sempu Island, Indonesia (Ascochilus emarginatus, Taeniophyllum biocellatum, and Thrixspermum subulatum), in relation to their adaptation to their habitat of coastal forests of Sempu Island. These orchids have different morphological characters; Ascochilus emarginatus and Thrixspermum subulatum are leafy orchids, while Taeniophyllum biocellatum is a leafless orchid. The results showed that all orchids have small number of velamen layers (1-2 layers) as an adaptation to the relatively humid condition. Cell wall thickenings of velamen, exodermis, and endodermis are structural adaptation of all orchids to the relatively high intensity of illumination, to reduce water loss because of transpiration. Mycorrhizal fungi colonization which is important for nutrient acquisition occurs in cortical cells. All orchids have differences in their cell shape, size, and specific characters, such as chloroplasts. The leafless Taeniophyllum biocellatum has many chloroplasts in the cortical root cells that support the photosynthesis process, while A. emarginatus and T. subulatum are lack of chloroplasts in their cortical root cells. {\textcopyright} 2016 Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition affects many natural processes, including forest litter decomposition. Saprotrophic fungi are the only organisms capable of completely decomposing lignocellulosic (woody) litter in temperate ecosystems, and therefore the responses of fungi to N deposition are critical in understanding the effects of global change on the forest carbon cycle. Plant litter decomposition under elevated N has been intensively studied, with varying results. The complexity of forest floor biota and variability in litter quality have obscured N-elevation effects on decomposers. Field experiments often utilize standardized substrates and N-levels, but few studies have controlled the decay organisms. Decomposition of beech (Fagus sylvatica) blocks inoculated with two cord-forming basidiomycete fungi, Hypholoma fasciculare and Phanerochaete velutina, was compared experimentally under realistic levels of simulated N deposition at Wytham Wood, Oxfordshire, UK. Mass loss was greater with P. velutina than with H. fasciculare, and with N treatment than in the control. Decomposition was accompanied by growth of the fungal mycelium and increasing N concentration in the remaining wood. We attribute the N effect on wood decay to the response of cord-forming wood decay fungi to N availability. Previous studies demonstrated the capacity of these fungi to scavenge and import N to decaying wood via a translocating network of mycelium. This study shows that small increases in N availability can increase wood decomposition by these organisms. Dead wood is an important carbon store and habitat. The responses of wood decomposers to anthropogenic N deposition should be considered in models of forest carbon dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Relatively little is known about the factors controlling ectomycorrhizal fungal communities. One possible factor is forest litter chemistry. In a series of experiments we demonstrated that the growth of ectomycorrhizal fungi able to colonize red pine (Pinus resinosa Air.) are differentially affected by red pine needles and needle chemical components. For example, water extracts of pine needles stimulated the growth of Suillus intermedius (Smith and Thiers) Smith and Thiers and inhibited the growth of Amanita rubescens Pers. Catechin and epicatechin gallate, components of the water extract, acted similarly to the extract. The volatile compounds $\alpha$- and $\beta$-pinene also had differential effects on the growth of the various species of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Our results suggest that forest litter chemistry has the potential differentially to affect the growth of ectomycorrhizal fungal species and so could affect the structure of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities.

AB  - Increasing soil nutrients through litter manipulation, pollution, or fertilization can adversely affect ectomycorrhizal (EM) communities by inhibiting fungal growth. In this study, we used molecular genetic methods to determine the effects of litter addition on the EM community of a Pinus contorta stand in Yellowstone National Park that regenerated after a stand-replacing fire. Two controls were used; in unmodified control plots nothing was added to the soil, and in perlite plots perlite, a chemically neutral substance, was added to maintain soil moisture and temperature at levels similar to those under litter. We found that (i) species richness did not change significantly following perlite addition (2.6 +/- 0.3 species/core in control plots, compared with 2.3 +/- 0.3 species/core in perlite plots) but decreased significantly (P < 0.05) following litter addition (1.8 +/- 0.3 species/core); (ii) EM infection was not affected by the addition of perlite but increased significantly (P < 0.001) in response to litter addition, and the increase occurred only in the upper soil layer, directly adjacent to the added litter; and (iii) Suillus granulatus, Wilcoxina mikolae, and agaricoid DD were the dominant organisms in controls, but the levels of W. mikolde and agaricoid DD decreased significantly in response to both perlite and litter addition. The relative levels of S. granulatus and a fourth fungus, Cortinariaceae species 2, increased significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) following litter addition. Thus, litter addition resulted in some negative effects that may be attributable to moisture-temperature relationships rather than to the increased nutrients associated with litter. Some species respond positively to litter addition, indicating that there are differences in their physiologies. Hence, changes in the EM community induced by litter accumulation also may affect ecosystem function.

AB  - In boreal forest, ground vegetation of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) and feather mosses strongly suppress seed regeneration of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). We investigated a site preparation technique by steam treatment to control bilberry and moss vegetation after clear cutting. Sowing experiments were performed between 1993 and 1995 with Scots pine in four treatments: (1) untreated vegetation, (2) activated carbon added to the soil surface of otherwise intact ground vegetation, (3) steam treated vegetation, and (4) activated carbon added to the soil surface of steam treated vegetation. Activated carbon was added to adsorb possible phenolic compounds released from bilberry leaves and litter. Steam killed ground vegetation effectively and recolonisation of vascular plants and mosses was slow. Scots pine seedling establishment was improved by steam treatment especially when activated carbon was added to the soil surface. We interpret that activated carbon adsorbed and reduced the levels of phenolics from bilberry litter and humus, which otherwise may inhibit seed germination. Dry weight of four year old seedlings was three times higher in steam treated plots than in untreated plots. Seedling nutrient content was also strongly improved by steam treatment. We interpret the increased growth of seedlings in steam treated plots mainly as an effect of reduced resource competition from ground vegetation. Irrespective of treatment, almost all fine roots were colonised by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Using PCR-based molecular methods we were able to identify 28 taxa forming mycorrhiza on the seedlings. Steam treatment did not affect species richness and abundance of ectomycorrhizal inocculum. We conclude that steam treatment has the potential to be an efficient and environmentally acceptable method to reduce negative influence of bilberry vegetation on Scots pine seedling establishment and early growth.

AB  - Wildfire shapes the structure, dynamic and functioning of boreal forests. With predicted warmer and drier summers, increased incidence and intensity of crown-fires may affect plant–soil interactions with consequences for post-fire fertility and forest productivity. We assessed how severity of crown- and ground-fire in boreal pine forests affected post-fire responses of soil fungal communities and their associated enzyme activities, and how variation in fire severity interacts with salvage (post-fire) logging in impacting soil fungi. Crown fire-induced tree mortality had a stronger impact on fungal biomass and community composition than did ground-fire-induced loss of soil organic matter. Severe crown-fire led to replacement of ectomycorrhizal- and litter-associated fungi by stress-tolerant ascomycetes. Elevated activities of hydrolytic enzymes in burned areas were correlated with root-associated ascomycetes and moulds, suggesting opportunistic exploitation of labile organic substrates. Fire did not, however, increase the abundance of more potent basidiomycete decomposers in the organic layer, nor did it enhance organic matter oxidation by fungal peroxidases, indicating that the potential for major post-fire losses of carbon due to stimulated decomposition is limited. Rather, peroxidase activity was low in burned areas, likely reflecting the absence of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Post-fire salvage logging induced larger shifts in fungal communities in areas with low crown-fire severity. Synthesis. Historically, boreal pine forests have been shaped by low-severity ground-fires. Our study highlights a risk that increasing occurrence of high-severity crown-fire as climate warms will have detrimental effects on mycorrhizal-mediated functions that are pivotal for maintaining organic matter turnover, soil fertility and forest resilience. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungal tissues comprise a significant forest-litter pool. Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi may also influence the decomposition of other forest-litter components via competitive interactions with decomposer fungi and by ensheathing fine roots. Because of these direct and indirect effects of ectomycorrhizal fungi, the factors that control the decomposition of EM fungi will strongly control forest-litter decomposition as a whole and, thus, ecosystem nutrient and carbon cycling. Some have suggested that chitin, a component of fungal cell walls, reduces fungal tissue decomposition because it is relatively recalcitrant. We therefore examined the change in chitin concentrations of EM fungal tissues during decomposition. Our results show that chitin is not recalcitrant relative to other compounds in fungal tissues and that its concentration is positively related to the decomposition of fungal tissues. Variation existing among EM fungal isolates in chitin concentration suggests that EM fungal community structure influences C and nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Poa nemoralis L. (Wood Meadow-grass) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. The grass Poa nemoralis is widespread and frequent to locally common across the British Isles, except for western and central Ireland, and northern Scotland. In both its native Eurasian range and introduced ranges in, for example, the Americas, its main habitat comprises temperate (mixed) deciduous woodland. The species finds important secondary habitats in hedgerows, as well as in non-woodland vegetation such as on cliffs, screes and walls or sporadically in grassland and heathland. Although not always taxonomically or morphologically distinct units, the species is suspected to comprise many cytological races and hybrid polyploid populations with variable morphology. Morphological variation among P. nemoralis populations may also be a sign of local environmental adaptation or a result of introgressive hybridization with other, morphologically variable members of Poa section Stenopoa such as P. glauca, P. compressa or P. pratensis. Poa nemoralis is a small-statured, loosely caespitose grass, with populations ranging from a few individual tufts to those visually defining the aspect of the herbaceous understorey. The species tolerates moderate to deep shade on the forest floor, yet it tends to forage for available light, occurring more and growing taller in canopy gaps, forest edges and hedgerows. The amount of light is central to its survival and reproductive ecology, being important for flower induction, seed production and seed germination. The species produces large quantities of small, light seeds which facilitate spatial and temporal dispersal. The species occupies a wide range of soil pH (3–7) and nutrient conditions (C/N ratio ranges between 10 and 25), though it clearly prefers moderately acid and somewhat drier soils with limited litter thickness, avoiding soils with mor humus types. Poa nemoralis displays distinct small-scale acidifuge responses, being absent in areas of low soil pH (<3). Poa nemoralis is a moderately strong indicator of ancient woodland: it can quickly colonize recently established wooded areas adjacent to ancient woodland when it is not hindered by dispersal limitation and elevated nutrient levels. Nonetheless, dispersal limitation impedes rapid colonization of isolated, recently established woodlands, in spite of ample records of zoochorous seed dispersal. While currently frequent to locally common, the species is at risk if ancient woodlands continue to decline in its native Eurasian range. Across N.W. Europe, it is already in moderate decline in temperate deciduous ancient woodlands because of acidification, eutrophication and darkening of the forest understorey. In its introduced ranges, it is considered invasive. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors. Journal of Ecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological Society

AB  - Long-term fire exclusion may weaken ecosystem resistance to the return of fire. We investigated how a surface wildfire that occurred after several decades of fire exclusion affected a southern Appalachian forest transitioning from a fire-adapted to a fire-intolerant state. Tree traits associated with fire adaptation often co-occur with traits for nutrient conservation, including the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) association. In the absence of fire, the ECM association may facilitate the accumulation of organic matter, which becomes colonized by fine roots that then become vulnerable to consumption or damage by fire. Therefore, a deeper organic horizon might make stands of fire-adapted, ECM trees less resistant to a surface wildfire than stands of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM), fire-intolerant trees. To test this hypothesis, we established plots in stands that fall along a gradient of mycorrhizal tree relative abundance both inside and outside the perimeter of the 2016 Rock Mountain wildfire. With increasing relative abundance of ECM trees, we found increasing organic horizon depth and mass and slower rates of decay, even for litter of ECM tree species. We calculated a major (73–83%) reduction in fine root biomass and length in the organic horizon following the wildfire. Over three years post-fire, we observed a higher probability of crown decline, basal sprouting and aboveground biomass mortality with increasing abundance of ECM trees. We propose that the biogeochemistry of mycorrhizal associations can help explain why fire exclusion makes stands of fire-adapted trees less resistant to a surface wildfire than those with fire-intolerant trees. {\textcopyright} 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - High concentrations of metals in organic matter can inhibit decomposition and limit nutrient availability in ecosystems, but the long-term fate of metals bound to forest litter is poorly understood. Controlled experiments indicate that during the first few years of litter decay, Al, Fe, Pb, and other metals that form stable complexes with organic matter are naturally enriched by several hundred percent as carbon is oxidized. The transformation of fresh litter to humus takes decades, however, such that current datasets describing the accumulation and release of metals in decomposing organic matter are time-scale limited. Here we use atmospheric Pb-210 to quantify the fate of metals in canopy-derived litter during burial and decay in coniferous forests in New England and Norway where decomposition rates are slow and physical soil mixing is minimal. We measure Pb-210 inventories in the O horizon and mineral soil and calculate a 60-630 year timescale for the production of mobile organo-metallic colloids from the decomposition of fresh forest detritus. This production rate is slowest at our highest elevation (similar to 1000 m) and highest latitude sites (>63 degrees N) where decomposition rates are expected to be low. We calculate soil layer ages by assuming a constant supply of atmospheric Pb-210 and find that they are consistent with the distribution of geochemical tracers from weapons fallout, air pollution, and a direct Pb-207 application at one site. By quantifying a gradient of organic matter ages with depth in the O horizon, we describe the accumulation and loss of metals in the soil profile as organic matter transforms from fresh litter to humus. While decomposition experiments predict that Al and Fe concentrations increase during the initial few years of decay, we show here that these metals continue to accumulate in humus for decades, and that enrichment occurs at a rate higher than can be explained by quantitative retention during decomposition alone. Acid extractable Al and Fe concentrations are higher in the humus layer of the O horizon than in the mineral soil immediately beneath this layer: it is therefore unlikely that physical soil mixing introduces significant Al and Fe to humus. This continuous enrichment of Al and Fe over time may best be explained by the recent suggestion that metals are mined from deeper horizons and brought into the O horizon via mycorrhizal plants. In sharp contrast to Al and Fe, we find that Mn concentrations in decomposing litter layers decrease exponentially with age, presumably because of leaching or rapid uptake, which may explain the low levels of acid extractable Mn in the mineral soil. This study quantifies how metals are enriched and lost in decomposing organic matter over a longer timescale than previous studies have been able to characterize. We also put new limits on the rate at which metals in litter become mobile organo-metallic complexes that can migrate to deeper soil horizons or surface waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Plants compete for nutrients using a range of strategies. We investigated nutrient foraging within nutrient hot-spots simultaneously available to plant species with diverse root traits. We hypothesized that there would be more root proliferation by thin-root species than by thick-root species, and that root proliferation by thin-root species would limit root proliferation by thick-root species. We conducted a root ingrowth experiment in a temperate forest in eastern USA where root systems of different tree species could interact. Tree species varied in the thickness of their absorptive roots, and were associated with either ectomycorrhizal (EM) or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Thus, there were thin- and thick-root AM and thin- and thick-root EM plant functional groups. Half the ingrowth cores were amended with organic nutrients (dried green leaves). Relative root length abundance, the proportion of total root length in a given soil volume occupied by a particular plant functional group, was calculated for the original root population and ingrowth roots after 6 months. The shift in relative root length abundance from original to ingrowth roots was positive in thin-root species but negative in thick-root species (p <.001), especially in unamended patches (AM: +6% vs. −7%; EM: +8% vs. −9%). Being thin-rooted may thus allow a species to more rapidly recolonize soil after a disturbance, which may influence competition for nutrients. Moreover, we observed that nutrient additions amplified the shift in root length abundance of thin over thick roots in AM trees (+13% vs. −14%), but not in EM trees (+1% vs −3%). In contrast, phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers suggested that EM fungal hyphae strongly proliferated in nutrient hot-spots whereas AM fungal hyphae exhibited only modest proliferation. We found no evidence that when growing in the shared patch, the proliferation of thin roots inhibited the growth of thick roots. Synthesis. Knowledge of root morphology and mycorrhizal type of co-existing tree species may improve prediction of patch exploitation and nutrient acquisition in heterogeneous soils. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Documenting succession in forest canopy gaps provides insights into the ecological processes governing the temporal dynamics of species within communities. We analyzed the fruiting patterns of a rare but widely distributed saproxylic macromycete, Xylobolus subpileatus, during the ageing of natural canopy gaps in oak forests. In one of the last remaining Quercus ilex L. old-growth forests (on the island of Corsica, western Mediterranean basin), we systematically recorded and conducted molecular analyses of X. subpileatus basidiomes in 80 dated natural canopy gaps representing a 45-year long sequence of residence time of tree logs on the forest floor. Xylobolus subpileatus fruited exclusively on Q. ilex logs. The probability of fruiting of X. subpileatus significantly increases during the process of wood decomposition to reach its maximum in the oldest gaps, approximately 40 years after treefall. In contrast, the abundance and the richness of saprobic and ectomycorrhizal fruitbodies decrease as canopy gaps age. Our results emphasize the high ecological specialization of X. subpileatus. They also highlight the imperative need to conserve the last patches of old-growth Mediterranean forests to secure the persistence of this endangered and functionally unique macromycete whose presence is highly dependent on old wood in advanced stages of decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2017, Canadian Science Publishing.

AB  - Decaying wood plays an important role in forest biodiversity, nutrient cycling and carbon balance. Community structure of wood-inhabiting fungi changes with mass loss of wood, but the relationship between substrate quality and decomposers is poorly understood. This limits the extent to which these ecosystem services can be effectively managed. We studied the fungal community and physico-chemical quality (stage of decay, dimensions, density, moisture, C: N ratio, lignin and water or ethanol extractives) of 543 Norway spruce logs in five unmanaged boreal forest sites of southern Finland. Fungi were identified using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing of DNA extracted directly from wood samples. Macroscopic fruiting bodies were also recorded. Results showed a fungal community succession with decreasing wood density and C: N ratio, and increasing moisture and lignin content. Fungal diversity peaked in the most decayed substrates. Ascomycetes typically colonized recently fallen wood. Brown-rot fungi preferred the intermediate decay stages. White-rot fungi represented approximately one-fifth of sequenced species in all decay phases excluding the final phase, where ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi became dominant. Lignin content of logs with white-rot fungi was low, and ECM fungi were associated with substrates containing abundant nitrogen. Macroscopic fruiting bodies were observed for only a small number of species detected with molecular techniques. {\textcopyright} 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB  - Rhododendron maximum L., a spreading understory shrub, inhibits overstory regeneration and alters forest community structure in southern Appalachian hardwood forests. Using paired plots and reciprocal litter transplants in forests with and without R. maximum cover, we examined the influence of R. maximum on litter mass and quality, N cycling and soil extracellular enzymes. Standing stocks of soil organic matter, soil N, leaf litter mass and fine root biomass were greater in forests with R. maximum than those without. Tannin extracts from R. maximum foliage, and leaf litter and fine roots collected under R. maximum had a relatively high capacity to precipitate protein compared to extracts from trees. Across the growing season, soil inorganic N availability was generally lower under R. maximum, mostly due to reduced NO<inf>3</inf>- availability. Our data suggest that R. maximum litter alters N cycling through the formation of recalcitrant polyphenol-organic N complexes. Soil extracellular enzymes indicate the potential processing rates of organic substrates. Between forest types, polyphenol oxidase activity was greatest in R. maximum O horizons, regardless of litter type, suggesting that the local microbial community can better degrade and access protein-tannin-complexed N. Protease activity did not differ between forest types, but was greater on R. maximum leaf litter than hardwood leaf litter. The alteration of the N cycle via the formation of polyphenol-organic N complexes may contribute to hardwood seedling suppression, while the enzymatic release of these complexes by ericoid mycorrhizal fungi may increase N acquisition for R. maximum and contribute to its expansion in southern Appalachian forests. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - We investigated consequences of plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) in a tropical montane forest on Mt. Kinabalu in Borneo by measurements of light and soil conditions, ecophysiological analyses of tree seedlings, a long-term adult and seedling census, and a simple simulation model. The study plot (2.74 ha) is in a mixed conifer-broadleaf forest with 24% relative basal area of conifers. First, we investigated light and soil conditions beneath two dominant species, a conifer Dacrydium gracilis (Podocarpaceae, arbuscular mycorrhizal tree) and a broadleaf Lithocaprus clementianus (Fagaceae, ectomycorrhizal tree). The relative light intensity was marginally higher beneath Dacrydium tree crown than beneath Lithocarpus tree crown. The concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and labile phosphorus, and the nitrogen mineralization rate, were lower beneath Dacrydium than beneath Lithocarpus, suggesting that soils beneath Dacrydium were more nutrient deficient. Microscopic observations confirmed that conifer seedlings (including Dacrydium) harbored arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In addition, a molecular analysis showed that root-associated mycorrhizal fungal communities were clearly different between conifer and broadleaf seedlings, and consequently, nutrient acquisition capacity of seedlings may be different between them. Indeed, stable isotopic evidence suggested that Dacrydium seedlings are more efficient in inorganic nitrogen acquisition than Lithocarpus seedlings. These results predicted that the conifer seedlings would out-compete broadleaf seedlings and have a greater advantage beneath the conifer canopy. To test the possible advantage of conifer seedlings in performance, we developed hierarchical Bayesian models and estimated growth and mortality rates using the seedling census data during 2006-2012. We found that conifer seedlings performed better than broadleaf seedlings beneath Dacrydium canopy. On the other hand, broadleaf seedlings performed better than conifer seedlings beneath Lithocarpus canopy. The consequences of the PSFs for the tree community composition were investigated by developing a simple simulation model, and were compared with the results of a model without PSFs. After a 10 000-year simulation, the relative abundance of conifers with PSFs converged to 22%, which was consistent with the actual abundance; the model without effects of PSFs predicted a relative abundance of only $\sim$10%. The results suggested that PSFs contributed to the maintenance of the conifer dominance in the tropical montane forest. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Carbon (C) fluxes among different components of plant growth are important to forest ecosystem C cycling and are strongly influenced by species composition and resource availability. Although mycorrhizal fungi are crucial for nutrient acquisition and can receive a large fraction of annual net primary production, most studies do not explicitly include carbon flux to mycorrhizal fungi in ecosystem C budgets. We measured annual production of plant components (foliage, wood, fine roots) and mycorrhizal fungi across temperate forest stands varying in species composition. Production of mycorrhizal fungi was estimated using both mass balance and isotopic techniques. Total plant production varied from about 600 g C m−2 y−1 in nearly pure deciduous broadleaf stands down to about 300 g C m−2 y−1 in conifer-dominated stands. In contrast, the production of mycorrhizal fungi was highest in conifer-dominated stands, varying from less than 25 g C m−2 y−1 in deciduous broadleaf stands to more than 175 g C m−2 y−1 in nearly pure conifer stands. Isotopic data indicated that both tree species composition and ecosystem nitrogen (N) availability influenced rates of fungal production. The large investment in mycorrhizal fungi in low-N, conifer-dominated stands demonstrated that a full accounting of ecosystem carbon fluxes to plant and fungal components may help resolve current discrepancies observed in broadscale forest carbon budgets, especially across forest types. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We investigated microbial biomass, fungal biomass and microbial community structure at three altitudes (1000, 2000 and 3000 m) and in two soil layers [L/F layer (Layer I) and underlying H/Ah layer (Layer II)] of tropical mountain rain forests in southern Ecuador. Basal respiration, microbial biomass and concentration of ergosterol generally declined from Layer I to Layer II and peaked at 2000 m. Compared to temperate forest ecosystems microbial biomass and ergosterol concentrations were generally low. Patterns in phospholipid fatty acids indicated that the composition of microbial communities markedly changed from Layer I to Layer II. These differences between layers decreased with increasing altitude. The concentration of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal marker PLFA 16:1$\omega$5c decreased with altitude in Layer I but increased in Layer II. The fungal-to-bacterial ratio increased with altitude and was higher in Layer I than in Layer II. Presumably, low microbial biomass in soils of tropical forest ecosystems is due to high temperature associated with high respiration but also low litter quality, with the latter declining with altitude. These conclusions are supported by the fact that at higher altitude the microbial community changed from a bacterial-dominated to a fungal-dominated system. CCA showed that microbial biomass correlated closely with density of a number of putatively bacterial feeding testate amoeba species including Corythion dubium Taranek, 1871, Euglypha cristata Leidy, 1879, Trigonopyxis arcula Penard, 1912, Tracheleuglypha dentata Deflandre, 1928 and Trinema lineare Penard, 1890. Ergosterol concentrations, but not the PLFA 18:2$\omega$6c, strongly correlated with the putatively fungal feeding species Phryganella acropodia (Hertwig, Lesser, 1874) Hopkinson, 1909. Generally, parallel to microbial biomass and ergosterol concentrations the density of testate amoebae peaked at 2000 m. However, compared to microbial parameters changes in testate amoebae communities between two layers were less pronounced. The data suggest that density and community structure of testate amoebae are driven by the availability of food resources (bacteria and fungi) which at high altitude decrease with increasing moisture and decreasing pH. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soil microbes in temperate forest ecosystems are able to cycle several hundreds of kilograms of N per hectare per year and are therefore of paramount importance for N retention. Belowground C allocation by trees is an important driver of seasonal microbial dynamics and may thus directly affect N transformation processes over the course of the year. Our study aimed at unraveling plant controls on soil N cycling in a temperate beech forest at a high temporal resolution over a time period of two years, by investigating the effects of tree girdling on microbial N turnover. In both years of the experiment, we discovered (1) a summer N mineralization phase (between July and August) and (2) a winter N immobilization phase (November-February). The summer mineralization phase was characterized by a high N mineralization activity, low microbial N uptake, and a subsequent high N availability in the soil. During the autumn/winter N immobilization phase, gross N mineralization rates were low, and microbial N uptake exceeded microbial N mineralization, which led to high levels of N in the microbial biomass and low N availability in the soil. The observed immobilization phase during the winter may play a crucial role for ecosystem functioning, since it could protect dissolved N that is produced by autumn litter degradation from being lost from the ecosystem during the phase when plants are mostly inactive. The difference between microbial biomass N levels in winter and spring equals 38 kg N/ha and may thus account for almost one- third of the annual plant N demand. Tree girdling strongly affected annual N cycling: the winter N immobilization phase disappeared in girdled plots (microbial N uptake and microbial biomass N were significantly reduced, while the amount of available N in the soil solution was enhanced). This was correlated to a reduced fungal abundance in autumn in girdled plots. By releasing recently fixed photosynthates to the soil, plants may thus actively control the annual microbial N cycle. Tree belowground C allocation increases N accumulation in microorganisms during the winter which may ultimately feed back on plant N availability in the following growing season. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - With the rapid industrial development and modern agricultural practices, increasing nitrogen (N) deposition can cause nutrient imbalance in immature volcanic ash soil commonly found in Japan. Larch species, widely distributed in northeast Eurasia, are associated with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi which play a critical role in nutrient acquisition for their hosts. In this study, we investigated species richness and diversity of ECM fungi associated with a hybrid larch (F1) and its parents, Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii var. japonica) and Japanese larch (L. kaempferi), under simulated N deposition (0 and 100 kg ha− 1 yr− 1) with/without phosphorous (P) (0 and 50 kg ha− 1 yr− 1). Seedlings planted in immature volcanic ash with low nutrient availability were subjected to the N and P treatments for fifteen months. We found that response of ECM community structure to the increased nutrient availability depended on host genotypes. Nutrient addition significantly affected ECM structure in Japanese larch, but no such significant effect was found for Dahurian larch. Effects of the nutrient addition to ECM fungal community in F1 were intermediate. F1 was tolerant to high N loading, which was due to consistent, relatively high association with Suillus sp. and Hebeloma sp. F1 showed heterosis in relative biomass, which was most apparent under high N treatments. This co-variation of ECM fungal community structure and F1 biomass in response to N loading suggest that ECM community structure might play an important role in host growth. The present findings indicate effects of N deposition on ECM fungal community structure can depend on larch species, thus it is challenging to predict general trends. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many northern forests are limited by nitrogen (N) availability, slight changes in which can have profound effects on ecosystem function and the activity of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi. Increasing N and phosphorus (P) availability, an analog to accelerated soil organic matter decomposition in a warming climate, could decrease plant dependency on EcM fungi and increase plant productivity as a result of greater carbon use efficiency. However, the impact of altered N and P availability on the growth and activity of EcM fungi in boreal forests remains poorly understood despite recognition of their importance to host plant nutrition and soil carbon sequestration. To address such uncertainty we examined above and belowground ecosystem properties in a boreal black spruce forest following five years of factorial N and P additions. By combining detailed soil, fungal, and plant delta N-15 measurements with in situ metrics of fungal biomass, growth, and activity, we found both expected and unexpected patterns. Soil nitrate isotope values became N-15 enriched in response to both N and P additions; fungal biomass was repressed by N yet both biomass and growth were stimulated by P; and, black spruce dependency on EcM derived N increased slightly when N and P were added alone yet significantly declined when added in combination. These findings contradict predictions that N fertilization would increase plant P demands and P fertilization would further exacerbate plant N demands. As a result, the prediction that EcM fungi predictably respond to plant N limitation was not supported. These findings highlight P as an under appreciated mediator of the activity of denitrifying bacteria, EcM fungi, and the dynamics of N cycles in boreal forests. Further, use of delta N-15 values from bulk soils, plants, and fungi to understand how EcM systems respond to changing nutrient availabilities will often require additional ecological information.

AB  - The early post-fire development of mycobiota following a crown fire in mountain pine plantations and a surface fire in Scots pine plantations, and in the corresponding unburnt stands in the coastal sand dunes of the Curonian Spit in western Lithuania was investigated. Species numbers in unburnt Pinus mugo and Pinus sylvestris stands showed annual fluctuation, but in the burnt sites, the numbers of fungi increased yearly, especially in the crown fire plots. Both burnt stand types-P. mugo and P. sylvestris-showed strongly significant (two-way ANOSIM; R = 1, p < 0.05) differences in species composition; the differences between unburnt sites were clearly expressed but less significant (R = 0.86, p < 0.05). Fungal species composition of burnt P. mugo and P. sylvestris sites was qualitatively different from that of corresponding unburnt sites (two-way ANOSIM; R ≥ 0.75, p < 0.05). The chronosequence of mycobiota in surface fire burns was less clearly defined than in crown fire sites, reflecting the greater patchiness of impacts of the surface fire. Although both fire types were detrimental or at least damaging to all functional groups of fungi (saprobic on soil and forest litter, wood-inhabiting, biotrophic, and mycorrhizal and lichenized fungi), their recovery and appearance (fructification) patterns varied between the groups and among the burn types. The end of the early post-fire fungal succession (cessation of sporocarp production of pyrophilous fungi) was recorded 3 years after the fire for both crown and surface fire types, which is earlier than reported by other authors. Rare or threatened fungal species that are dependent on fire regime were not recorded during the study. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Declining biodiversity (BD) is affecting food security, agricultural sustainability, and environmental quality. Agroforestry (AF) is recognized as a possible partial solution for BD conservation and improvement. This manuscript uses published peer-reviewed manuscripts, reviews, meta-analysis, and federal and state agency documents to evaluate relationships between AF and BD and how AF can be used to conserve BD. The review revealed that floral, faunal, and soil microbial diversity were significantly greater in AF as compared to monocropping, adjacent crop lands, and within crop alleys and some forests. Among the soil organisms, arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi (AMF), bacteria, and enzyme activities were significantly greater in AF than crop and livestock practices. Agroforestry also creates spatially concentrated high-density BD near trees due to favorable soil-plant-water-microclimate conditions. The greater BD was attributed to heterogeneous vegetation, organic carbon, microclimate, soil conditions, and spatial distribution of trees. Differences in BD between AF and other management types diminished with time. Evenly distributed leaves, litter, roots, dead/live biological material, and microclimate improve soil and microclimate in adjacent crop and pasture areas as the system matures. Results of the study prove that integration of AF can improve BD in agricultural lands. Selection of site suitable tree/shrub/grass-crop combinations can be used to help address soil nutrient deficiencies or environmental conditions. Future studies with standardized management protocols may be needed for all regions to further strengthen these findings and to develop AF establishment criteria for BD conservation and agricultural sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Thickets of Rhododendron maximum(Ericaceae) (Rm) in the southern Appalachians severely limit regeneration of hardwood and coniferous seedlings. Experimental blocks were established in and out of Rm thickets in a mature, mixed hardwood/conifer forest in Macon County, N.C. Litter and organic layer substrates were removed, composited and redistributed among plots within the blocks (except for control plots). Seedlings of northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) were planted in the plots and harvested at the end of the first and second growing seasons. Litter manipulation had no effect on total mycorrhizal colonization, but the distribution of Cenococcum geophilum mycorrhizae was altered. After the first year, percent mycorrhizal colonization of hemlocks not in Rm thickets (62\%) was at least three times higher than in Rm thickets (19\%), and the ramification index (no. of mycorrhizae cm(-1)) had increased by more than a factor of four (2.83 versus 0.61). In addition, colonization of 1-year-old hemlocks by C. geophilum was significantly higher within blocks with (10.4\%) than without (4.6\%) Rm. Differences in mycorrhizal colonization, ramification indices and colonization by C. geophilum were absent or less pronounced on 2-year-old hemlocks and 1- and 2-year-old oak seedlings. The biomasses of first year oak roots and shoots and second year shoots were 50\% less in Rm thickets. Biomasses of first year hemlock roots and second year shoots were also reduced. Mycorrhizal parameters were correlated with some growth parameters only for hemlock seedlings, but did not explain most of the variation observed.

AB  - We have identified the importance of ground layer ericaceous shrub density as a determinant of leaf litter patch size in upland oak/pine communities of the New Jersey pine barrens. Litter patch area is directly proportional to the number of ericaceous stems. This observation has been confirmed by experimentation where leaf litter patches accumulated under artificial stems for a period of 2 years. Leaf litter patches of different sizes contain differing proportions of leaf species. Large patches contain a significantly higher proportion of oak leaves than small patches. Difference in physical structure of large and small patches, due to leaf species composition and due to differential leaf chemistries, result in differences in soil characteristics and soil biota under the patches. Soil moisture and organic matter content of upper soil layers are greater under large litter patches than under small ones. We have preliminary evidence that these changes influence the community structure of ectomycorrhizae developing under patches of different sizes.

AB  - Fungi are the main agents of coarse woody debris decomposition in forest ecosystems. We examined the associations of environmental variables with fungal community structures in dead pine logs at 12 geographically distant sites using amplicon pyrosequencing of fungal ITS rDNA. A total of 575 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified based on clustering at 97\% similarity. Among the known fungal ecological groups, saprotrophic fungi generally showed highest frequency of occurrence and were positively associated with mean annual temperature (MAT) and log diameter. Wood decay fungi with unknown decay type were positively associated with pine wilt disease and negatively associated with log diameter. Ordination analysis of the 42 most prevalent OTUs showed that MAT and annual precipitation significantly explained the observed fungal community structure. These results suggested that climate conditions and site history differentially effect structure fungal communities in pine logs among different ecological groups.

AB  - Establishing diverse mycorrhizal fungal communities is considered important for forest recovery, yet mycorrhizae may have complex effects on tree growth depending on the composition of fungal species present. In an effort to understand the role of mycorrhizal fungi community in forest restoration in southern Costa Rica, we sampled the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community across eight sites that were planted with the same species (Inga edulis, Erythrina poeppigiana, Terminalia amazonia, and Vochysia guatemalensis) but varied twofold to fourfold in overall tree growth rates. The AMF community was measured in multiple ways: as percent colonization of host tree roots, by DNA isolation of the fungal species associated with the roots, and through spore density, volume, and identity in both the wet and dry seasons. Consistent with prior tropical restoration research, the majority of fungal species belonged to the genus Glomus and genus Acaulospora, accounting for more than half of the species and relative abundance found on trees roots and over 95% of spore density across all sites. Greater AMF diversity correlated with lower soil organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen concentrations and longer durations of prior pasture use across sites. Contrary to previous literature findings, AMF species diversity and spore densities were inversely related to tree growth, which may have arisen from trees facultatively increasing their associations with AMF in lower soil fertility sites. Changes to AMF community composition also may have led to variation in disturbance susceptibility, host tree nutrient acquisition, and tree growth. These results highlight the potential importance of fungal–tree–soil interactions in forest recovery and suggest that fungal community dynamics could have important implications for tree growth in disturbed soils. {\"{i}}¿½ 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The spatio-temporal distribution of basidiomycetes colonising coniferous litter, and their impact on carbon and nitrogen cycling is reviewed. Afteria brief phase of colonisation by phyllosphere ascomycetes and ephemeral basidiomycetes, litter is colonised by fungi with higher capacity for litter decomposition, such as Mycena species. This change in fungal community composition involves a shift in substrate utilisation from relatively readly available sugars to cellulose. The fungi overcome the nitrogen deficiency experienced during litter colonisation by translocating nitrogen from older parts of the mycelium. To retrieve nitrogen from well-decomposed litter, the fungi presumably use carbohydrates translocated from fresh litter as a co-substrate to attack polyphenol-nitrogen complexes. After a few years of decomposition, the saprotrophic fungal community is out-competed by mycorrhizal fungi. Their direct access to photo-assimilates is likely to be a major competitive advantage in highly recalcitrant and cellulose-depleted resources. Decomposition is continued by the mycorrhizal fungi, although at a very slow rate. It is not until this phase that net losses of nitrogen from the litter occur, as the mycorrhizal fungi forage for nitrogen to support themselves and their host plants. In low-productivity coniferous forests, saprotrophic fungi, thus, re-cycle litter carbon to the atmosphere, whereas re-cycling of litter nitrogen to growing plants is performed largely by my-corrhizal fungi. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background. Soil microbial communities and their associated enzyme activities play key roles in carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Soil microbial communities are sensitive to resource availability, but the mechanisms of microbial regulation have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we tested the mechanistic relationships between microbial responses and multiple interacting resources. Methods. We examined soil carbon properties, soil microbial community structure and carbon-related functions under nitrogen addition and plant inputs removal (litter removal (NL), root trench and litter removal (NRL)) in a pure Larix principis-rupprechtii plantation in northern China. Results. We found that nitrogen addition affected the soil microbial community structure, and that microbial biomass increased significantly once 100 kg ha a of nitrogen was added. The interactions between nitrogen addition and plant inputs removal significantly affected soil bacteria and their enzymatic activities (oxidases). The NL treatment enhanced soil microbial biomass under nitrogen addition. We also found that the biomass of gram-negative bacteria and saprotrophic fungi directly affected the soil microbial functions related to carbon turnover. The biomass of gram-negative bacteria and peroxidase activity were key factors controlling soil carbon dynamics. The interactions between nitrogen addition and plant inputs removal strengthened the correlation between the hydrolases and soil carbon. Conclusions. This study showed that nitrogen addition and plant inputs removal could alter soil enzyme activities and further affect soil carbon turnover via microbial regulation. The increase in soil microbial biomass and the microbial regulation of soil carbon both need to be considered when developing effective sustainable forest management practices for northern China. Moreover, further studies are also needed to exactly understand how the complex interaction between the plant and below-ground processes affects the soil microbial community structure.

AB  - The impact of an acidifying fertilizer on litter decomposition, root mycorrhizae, and soil and tree chemistry was assessed in two hardwood forests in central Ontario, Canada. Soil beneath mature sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) trees was treated with. (NH4)(2)SO4 granules at application rates of 0, 250, 500, and 1000 kg/ha in May of each year between 1993 and 1994 at Dorset and between 1993 and 1995 at Loring. The fertilizer treatments did not cause visual symptoms of forest decline. At Dorset, SO4 and cation concentrations in soil leachate increased, but no difference in soil pH between treatments was found. An increase in foliar N was recorded at Dorset in treated plots, although there were no other differences in foliar or tree ring chemistry between treatments. At Loring, a decrease in soil pH and an increase in SO4 in soil leachate were found in treated plots. Mycorrhizal infection and litter decomposition were also reduced in plots treated with (NH4)(2)SO4. Fertilizer application at Loring led to increases in foliar concentrations of N, Mg, Mn, and Cd, along with increases in concentrations of trace metals (As, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Zn) in tree rings formed during fertilizer application. Significant positive correlations (p < 0.05) were found between wood (rings formed between 1993 and 1995) and foliage (mean of 1993-1995 values) for Mg, Mn, and Al. Deliberate acidification of surface soil resulted in changes in wood and foliar chemistry, although it remains to be established whether acidification of surface soil is responsible for the reported decline in sugar maple.

AB  - The contribution of the mycorrhizospheric microbes in a stand of ectomycorrhizal Norway spruce (Picea abies) featuring mycorrhiza with the basidiomycete Tricholoma vaccinum was addressed by microbiome analysis and in vitro reconstruction of microbial as well as plant-microbe interactions. The protective role of the mycorrhizal fungus with respect to pathogen attack could be validated against Botrytis cinerea and Heterobasidion annosum in co-cultures revealing reduced pathogen growth, higher survival rate of the spruce trees and reduced symptoms on needles upon symbiosis with T. vaccinum. The community structure was shown to yield a high diversity in ECM forming basidiomycetes of Thelephorales and Agaricales associated with a rich bacterial diversity dominated by Rhizobiales with the most abundant Nitrobacter winogradski (3.9%). Isolated bacteria were then used to address plant growth promoting abilities, which included production of the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (performed by 74% of the bacterial isolates), siderophores (22%), and phosphate mobilization (23%). Among the isolates, mycorrhiza helper bacteria (MHB) were identified, with Bacillus cereus MRZ-1 inducing hyperbranching in T. vaccinum, supporting tree germination, shoot elongation, and root formation as well as higher mycorrhization rates. Thus, a huge pool of potential MHB and fungal community with widely distributed auxin-production potential extended the ability of T. vaccinum to form ectomycorrhiza. The forest community profited from the mycorrhizal fungus T. vaccinum, with spruce survival enhanced by 33% in microcosms using soil from the native habitat. A higher fungal abundance and diversity in cases where the tree had died during the experiment, showing that decomposition of plant litter from a dead tree supported a different community. T. vaccinum thus actively structured the community of microorganisms in its habitat. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2019 Wagner, Krause, Gallegos-Monterrosa, Sammer, Kov{\'{a}}cs and Kothe.

AB  - Tree mortality from insect infestations can significantly reduce carbon storage in forest soils. In subarctic birch forests (Betula pubescens), ecosystem C cycling is largely affected by recurrent outbreaks of defoliating geometrid moths (Epirrita autumnata, Operophtera brumata). Here, we show that soil C stocks in birch forests across Fennoscandia did not change up to 8 years after moth outbreaks. We found that a decrease in woody fine roots was accompanied by a lower soil CO2 efflux rate and a higher soil N availability following moth outbreaks. We suggest that a high N availability and less ectomycorrhiza likely contributed to lowered heterotrophic respiration and soil enzymatic activity. Based on proxies for decomposition (heterotrophic respiration, phenol oxidase potential activity), we conclude that a decrease in decomposition is a prime cause why soil C stocks of mountain birch forest ecosystems have not changed after moth outbreaks. Compared to disturbed temperate and boreal forests, a CO2-related positive feedback of forest disturbance on climate change might therefore be smaller in subarctic regions. {\textcopyright} 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - In tropical rain forests the rate of litterfall is high, and is the most important nutrient cycling pathway in these ecosystems. We tested two hypotheses using seedlings of dipterocarp species: (1) addition of leaf litter improves growth; (2) and litter addition affects both ectomycorrhizal (ECM) colonization and community structure. Three dipterocarp species with contrasting ecologies (Parashorea tomentella, Hopea nervosa and Dryobalanops lanceolata) were grown in a nursery in forest soil with or without the addition of litter. Litter addition improved the growth of all three species. There was no effect of litter addition on total percentage ECM colonization but ECM diversity and percentage colonization by Cenococcum geophilum were lower with litter addition. Foliar delta(15)N was lower in two of the three species grown in the presence of litter, reflecting the lower delta(15)N of the litter compared with the soil. There was a negative correlation between delta(15)N and percentage ECM, suggesting a role for ECMs in accessing litter-derived N sources. This study shows that litter addition improved the growth of dipterocarp seedlings and that the ECM associations of dipterocarps facilitated access to this organic nutrient source. This has implications for the successful regeneration of seedlings in the rain forest understorey.

AB  - Reindeer grazing in northern boreal zone affects forest floor vegetation heavily and alters the vegetation structure. However, the effect of grazing on soil fungal communities, which are intimately linked to plants, is not currently known. Therefore, our objectives were to investigate changes caused by reindeer grazing on soil fungal communities, litter decomposition rate and litter degrading extracellular enzyme activities. The study was conducted in four areas divided into grazed and non-grazed sites (all together 38 sample plots) in northern boreal forests in Finnish Lapland. Fungal communities were analyzed from humus with high-throughput sequencing technology (454-pyrosequencing), and litter mass loss and extracellular enzyme activities were analyzed after a one-year litterbag experiment. The results showed that grazing significantly affected the fungal community structure and the abundance of certain fungal genera and species. Grazing also decreased laccase and enhanced cellobiohydrolase I activities from the litterbags. Our study is one of the first to describe detailed fungal community composition in sites with long-term history of reindeer grazing and exclusion. Our results indicate that reindeer grazing alter fungal community structure and litter degradation related enzyme activities in the northern boreal forest soils. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors

AB  - Tropical forests are renowned for their high diversity, yet in many sites a single tree species accounts for the majority of the individuals in a stand. An explanation for these monodominant forests remains elusive, but may be linked to mycorrhizal symbioses. We tested three hypotheses by which ectomycorrhizas might facilitate the dominance of the tree, Oreomunnea mexicana, in montane tropical forest in Panama. We tested whether access to ectomycorrhizal networks improved growth and survival of seedlings, evaluated whether ectomycorrhizal fungi promote seedling growth via positive plant-soil feedback, and measured whether Oreomunnea reduced inorganic nitrogen availability. We found no evidence that Oreomunnea benefits from ectomycorrhizal networks or plant-soil feedback. However, we found three-fold higher soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations outside than inside Oreomunnea-dominated forest and a correlation between soil nitrate and Oreomunnea abundance in plots. Ectomycorrhizal effects on nitrogen cycling might therefore provide an explanation for the monodominance of ectomycorrhizal tree species worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.

AB  - Mycorrhizal fungi have evolved with their plant partners and enabled them with better growth in stressed and disturbed environments by better nutrient acquisition and protection against pathogens. Any stress or disturbance belowground is reflected first in changes in mycorrhizal community structure. The complex mycorrhizal networks and interactions among mycorrhizosphere organisms regulate the carbon dynamics and stability of forest ecosystems by 'beneficial interactions' or 'collaboration' rather than by competition-especially under stress and disturbance. This chapter provides an overview of mycorrhizal forms, structure and functions, their vulnerability and their central role in complex mycorrhizosphere interactions. Their disruption may lead to the loss of essential functions of forest ecosystems. The conservation of belowground interactions should be among priority areas of future research and monitoring programmes and strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The fungi-to-bacteria ratio in soil ecological concepts and its application to explain the effects of land use changes have gained increasing attention over the past decade. Four different main approaches for quantifying the fungal and bacterial contribution to microbial tissue can be distinguished: (1) microscopic methods, (2) selective inhibition, (3) specific cell membrane components and (4) specific cell wall components. In this review, the different methods were compared and we hypothesized that all these approaches result in similar values for the fungal and bacterial contribution to total microbial biomass, activity, and residues (dead microbial tissue) if these methods are evenly reliable for the estimation of fungal biomass. The fungal contribution to the microbial biomass or respiration varied widely between 2 and 95% in different data sets published over the past three decades. However, the majority of the literature data indicated that fungi dominated microbial biomass, respiration or non-biomass microbial residues, with mean percentages obtained by the different methodological approaches varying between 35 and 76% in different soil groups, i.e. arable, grassland, and forest soils and litter layers. Microscopic methods generally gave the lowest average values, especially in arable and grasslands soils. Very low ratios in fungal biomass C-to-ergosterol obtained by microscopic methods suggest a severe underestimation of fungal biomass by certain stains. Relatively consistent ratios of ergosterol to linoleic acid (18:2$\omega$6,9) indicate that both cell membrane components are useful indicators for saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi. More quantitative information on the PLFA content of soil bacteria and the 16:1$\omega$5 content of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is urgently required to fully exploit the great potential of PLFA measurements. The most consistent results have been obtained from the analysis of fungal glucosamine and bacterial muramic acid in microbial residues. Component-specific $\delta$13C analyses of PLFA and amino sugars are a promising prospect for the near future. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined whether ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi produce extracellular enzymes in culture and whether leaf litter addition affected production. We found little consistency in enzyme production among ECM fungi. Most fungi produced substantial levels of acid phosphatase and levels for many ECM fungi were equivalent to saprotrophic fungi. However, saprotrophic fungi had higher chitinase levels than ECM fungi. Some ECM fungi (e.g. Russula) produced levels of oxidative enzymes that were equivalent to saprotrophic fungi. Our results suggest enzyme activity varies greatly among ECM fungi with some species producing enzymes at levels equivalent to saprotrophic fungi. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rates of asymbiotic nitrogen fixation in woody debris, forest floor and mineral soils were investigated in stem-only harvested and wildfire-killed lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta sap. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Wats.) stands in the central interior of British Columbia using an acetylene reduction assay. The long-term contribution of those nitrogen fixation processes to site nitrogen economy was estimated by mass loadings, associated nitrogen fixation rates and decomposition models. Asymbiotic nitrogen fixation activity was detected in all the woody and litter substrates examined. There were significant differences in nitrogenase activities between substrates. The highest activity (16.10+/-4.75 nm C2H4 g(-1) day(-1)) occurred in the below-ground woody debris (dead roots), followed in order by stumps, advanced or medium decay stems, litter, humus, early decay stems and, the lowest (0.07+/-0.03 nm C2H4 g(-1) day(-1)), mineral soil. Because of its relatively high rate of nitrogen fixation, below-ground woody debris is thought to have an important, but largely unrecognized, ecological role in the long-term site productivity of lodgepole pine forests. Moisture was the most important factor affecting the asymbiotic nitrogen fixation activity in woody debris in the study area. Asymbiotic nitrogen fixation in the above-ground woody debris was greater on the wildfire-killed sites than on the harvested sites due to much higher woody debris loadings and longer persistence on the former sites. The dynamics and role of asymbiotic nitrogen fixation over pine stand development were presented and discussed. Replacement of nitrogen removals from disturbance by asymbiotic nitrogen fixation would take 180 years for both stem-only and wildfire-killed sites. However, this could be shortened while considering other sources of nitrogen fixation in the study area such as nitrogen-fixing shrub, Sheperdia canadensis (L) Nutt and mycorrhizae. Management implications of asymbiotic nitrogen fixation were also discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Litter decomposition is an enzymatically-complex process that is mediated by a diverse assemblage of saprophytic microorganisms. It is a globally important biogeochemical process that can be suppressed by anthropogenic N deposition. In a northern hardwood forest ecosystem located in Michigan, USA, 20 years of experimentally increased atmospheric N deposition has reduced forest floor decay and increased soil C storage. Here, we paired extracellular enzyme assays with shotgun metagenomics to assess if anthropogenic N deposition has altered the functional potential of microbial communities inhabiting decaying forest floor. Experimental N deposition significantly reduced the activity of extracellular enzymes mediating plant cell wall decay, which occurred concurrently with changes in the relative abundance of metagenomic functional gene pathways mediating the metabolism of carbohydrates, aromatic compounds, as well as microbial respiration. Moreover, experimental N deposition increased the relative abundance of 50 of the 60 gene pathways, the majority of which were associated with saprotrophic bacteria. Conversely, the relative abundance and composition of fungal genes mediating the metabolism of plant litter was not affected by experimental N deposition. Future rates of atmospheric N deposition have favored saprotrophic soil bacteria, whereas the metabolic potential of saprotrophic fungi appears resilient to this agent of environmental change. Results presented here provide evidence that changes in the functional capacity of saprotrophic soil microorganisms mediate how anthropogenic N deposition increases C storage in soil. {\textcopyright} 2016 Freedman, Upchurch, Zak and Cline.

AB  - New knowledge on soil structure highlights its importance for hydrology and soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization, which however remains neglected in many wide used models. We present here a new model, KEYLINK, in which soil structure is integrated with the existing concepts on SOM pools, and elements from food web models, that is, those from direct trophic interactions among soil organisms. KEYLINK is, therefore, an attempt to integrate soil functional diversity and food webs in predictions of soil carbon (C) and soil water balances. We present a selection of equations that can be used for most models as well as basic parameter intervals, for example, key pools, functional groups' biomasses and growth rates. Parameter distributions can be determined with Bayesian calibration, and here an example is presented for food web growth rate parameters for a pine forest in Belgium. We show how these added equations can improve the functioning of the model in describing known phenomena. For this, five test cases are given as simulation examples: changing the input litter quality (recalcitrance and carbon to nitrogen ratio), excluding predators, increasing pH and changing initial soil porosity. These results overall show how KEYLINK is able to simulate the known effects of these parameters and can simulate the linked effects of biopore formation, hydrology and aggregation on soil functioning. Furthermore, the results show an important trophic cascade effect of predation on the complete C cycle with repercussions on the soil structure as ecosystem engineers are predated, and on SOM turnover when predation on fungivore and bacterivore populations are reduced. In summary, KEYLINK shows how soil functional diversity and trophic organization and their role in C and water cycling in soils should be considered in order to improve our predictions on C sequestration and C emissions from soils. {\textcopyright} 2021 PeerJ Inc..

AB  - The linkage between tree diversity and the soil food web in temperate deciduous forest ecosystems remains uncertain. Using microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), we analyzed the effect of tree species composition on microbial communities from topsoil collected in Hainich National Park, Germany. Previous results had shown minimal direct effects of tree species on the microbial community in autumn, most likely due to low plant activity and high nutrient and energy input from litterfall. However, microbial composition was affected indirectly through an influence of tree species on soil pH. In this study, we analyzed PLFA profiles in early summer and compared them with the results from autumn sampling. We hypothesized that plant-based traits would have stronger direct effects on the abundance and structure of the microbial community during the photosynthetically active period. The results showed that the soil microbial community differed more markedly between the tree diversity levels in early summer than in autumn. The acidifying character of the decaying beech litter strongly influenced the soil pH values and structured the soil microbial community indirectly in early summer as it had in autumn. However, the measured differences in the microbial composition in early summer could be attributed primarily to litter quality. This direct influence of plant traits appeared to be eclipsed in autumn because of the high nutrient supply from fresh litter input. Following litter decomposition in the topsoil, however, litter-based plant traits emerged as a factor structuring the soil microbial community in early summer. Our results suggest that the PLFAs i14:0 and i15:0, indicative of Gram-positive bacteria, are strongly involved in decomposition processes and may be promoted by readily available nutrients. Furthermore, our results indicate that a dense root network in association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi strongly supported microbial growth in the more diverse forest stands. High proportions of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (PLFA 16:1 omega 5), root-associated microorganisms PLFAs 16:1 omega 9, 16:1 omega 7, 17:1 omega 8 and 18:1 omega 7) and bacterial grazers (PLFA 20:5) characterized the microbial community in early summer on these study plots. We conclude that microbial communities are strongly influenced by abiotic controls. However, seasonal differences in litter decomposition rates and root activity should be considered in the analysis of the effects of tree diversity or species on soil microbial communities.

AB  - Buttressing is a trait special to tropical trees but explanations for its occurrence remain inconclusive. The two main hypotheses are that they provide structural support and/or promote nutrient acquisition. Studies of the first are common but the second has received much less attention. Architectural measurements were made on adult and juvenile trees of the ectomycorrhizal species Microberlinia bisulcata, in Korup (Cameroon). Buttressing on this species is highly distinctive with strong lateral extension of surface roots of the juveniles leading to a mature buttress system of a shallow spreading form on adults. This contrasts with more vertical buttresses, closer to the stem, found on many other tropical tree species. No clear relationship between main buttress and large branch distribution was found. Whilst this does not argue against the essential structural role of buttresses for these very large tropical trees, the form on M. bisulcata does suggest a likely second role, that of aiding nutrient acquisition. At the Korup site, with its deep sandy soils of very low phosphorus status, and where most nutrient cycling takes place in a thin surface layer of fine roots and mycorrhizas, it appears that buttress form could develop from soil-surface root exploration for nutrients by juvenile trees. It may accordingly allow M. bisulcata to attain the higher greater competitive ability, faster growth rate, and maximum tree size that it does compared with other co-occurring tree species. For sites across the tropics in general, the degree of shallowness and spatial extension of buttresses of the dominant species is hypothesized to increase with decreasing nutrient availability. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Stable isotope ratios of terrestrial ecosystem nitrogen (N) pools reflect internal processes and input-output balances. Disturbance generally increases N cycling and loss, yet few studies have examined ecosystem $\delta$15N over a disturbance-recovery sequence. We used a chronosequence approach to examine N distribution and $\delta$15N during forest regrowth after agricultural abandonment. Site ages ranged from 10 to 115 years, with similar soils, climate, land-use history, and overstory vegetation (white pine Pinus strobus). Foliar N and $\delta$15N decreased as stands aged, consistent with a progressive tightening of the N cycle during forest regrowth on agricultural lands. Over time, foliar $\delta$15N became more negative, indicating increased fractionation along the mineralization- mycorrhizal-plant uptake pathway. Total ecosystem N was constant across the chronosequence, but substantial internal N redistribution occurred from the mineral soil to plants and litter over 115 years (>25% of ecosystem N or 1,610 kg ha-1). Temporal trends in soil $\delta$15N generally reflected a redistribution of depleted N from the mineral soil to the developing O horizon. Although plants and soil $\delta$15N are coupled over millennial time scales of ecosystem development, our observed divergence between plants and soil suggests that they can be uncoupled during the disturbance-regrowth sequence. The approximate 2‰ decrease in ecosystem $\delta$15N over the century scale suggests significant incorporation of atmospheric N, which was not detected by traditional ecosystem N accounting. Consideration of temporal trends and disturbance legacies can improve our understanding of the influence of broader factors such as climate or N deposition on ecosystem N balances and $\delta$15N. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Wekerom forest shows a high nitrogen (N) load, and the first signs of N saturation. This characterization is based on the high N content of the needles, the high nitrate-N (NO3-N) mobilization and low cation mobilization from the organic horizon. The N cycle in this forest has been transformed into an ``open flow{''} system, in which the ammonium-N, deposited in large quantities from the atmosphere, is transformed into NO3-N, which is leached into the groundwater. Decomposition of deeper organic layers, such as the fragmented litter and humus layers, is thought to provide additional NH4-N, which explains the high NO3-N output. Together with a reduction in the number and vitality of the pine trees, there is an increase in the number of nitrophilous plants, such as Deschampsia flexuosa and Rumex acetosella. The ectomycorrhizal and litter-decaying fungi are specific, N-resistant species. Soil fauna are classified as common inhabitants of dry, acid, nutrient poor forests.

AB  - Seedlings of Eucalyptus regnans (mountain ash) grow poorly in undried forest soil, where they develop purple coloration in the foliage, but their growth is markedly improved when forest soil has been air dried. Whether this growth promotion is purely due to improved nutrient status of the soil, as a result of air drying, was investigated. In several pot experiments, E. regnans seedlings were grown (i) in air-dried and undried forest soil with addition of different levels of complete fertiliser, (ii) in air-dried or undried soil diluted to different extents with sand, or (iii) in undried soil mixed with different amounts of air-dried soil. Seedling dry weight, P content and incidence of ectomycorrhizal root tips were determined. In all experiments, the dry weights of seedlings were 3-6 times greater in 100% air-dried soil than in 100% undried soil. Fertiliser application resulted in a significant increase in dry weight of seedlings in both air-dried and undried soil, but the dry weights in air-dried soil were always significantly greater than those in undried soil at the same level of fertiliser application. Even at the highest level of fertiliser application, the growth difference between seedlings in air-dried and undried soil remained. When air-dried soil was diluted with sand, there was a significant reduction in seedling dry weight only when soil was diluted to 20% or less (air-dried soil:total mix). Conversly, when air-dried soil was mixed with undried soil, there was a proportional decrease in seedling dry weight with increasing amounts of undried soil. In all experiments, the dominant ectomycorrhizal morphotypes in 100% air-dried soil were different from those in undried soil. Fertilisation and dilution of air-dried and undried soil did not result in a reduction in the overall incidence of ectomycorrhizal root tips, although the frequency of occurrence of different ectomycorrhizal morphotypes was affected. It is concluded that the growth difference between seedlings in air-dried and undried forest soils is not due solely to differences in the direct availability of nutrients in the soils, and different ectomycorrhizae may indirectly affect nutrient availability to the plant. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.

AB  - Fine roots are a dominant, but often overlooked source of carbon (C) in forest soils, and decomposition of this material may have important consequences for C storage and turnover in forest ecosystems. Forest harvesting modifies soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities, which may lead to faster decomposition rates, but the effect of harvesting on fine-root decomposition is rarely investigated. Variable-retention harvesting, where some trees are left on site after harvest, often results in lower soil moisture and temperature, and increased ectomycorrhizal diversity relative to clearcut harvesting. As such, this harvesting practice may influence fine-root decomposition rates. In Douglas-fir forests in coastal British Columbia, we measured fine-root (<2 mm diameter) decomposition rates in variable-retention (aggregate and dispersed arrangements), clearcut, and uncut treatments, and determined if any effects persisted as stands aged. Within the variable-retention treatments, we also examined if fine-root decomposition rates varied with distance from retention trees or retention patches. Further, we determined which soil physicochemical variables best explained variation in fine-root carbon loss after two years of decomposition. Increased tree coverage slowed fine-root decomposition; fine roots decomposed as slowly under variable-retention treatments as in uncut stands, and 15–19% more carbon was retained in these treatments relative to the clearcut treatment. Fine roots also decomposed faster with increasing distance from retention patches or retention trees as decomposition was twofold slower in the aggregate centre relative to open areas, with similar patterns observed in the dispersed retention treatment. However, fine roots decomposed at similar rates in forests and stands with more advanced regeneration, suggesting the effects of harvesting on decomposition rates was not persistent. Across all sampling locations, 37% of the variation in fine-root carbon loss was explained by fine-root biomass, and nitrate, potassium and sulphate availability. Nitrate availability was also positively correlated with the proportional mass of carbon lost during the decomposition experiment, suggesting that fine-root decomposition is sensitive to harvesting-induced changes in soil physicochemistry, and that variable-retention harvesting moderates the effects of harvesting on decomposition rates. These findings indicate that shortly after harvest, retention of even single trees can prevent the increase in fine-root decomposition rates associated with clearcut harvesting in these coastal Douglas-fir forests. Accordingly, management practices such as variable-retention harvesting that retain some trees in a cutblock may reduce soil C losses following forest harvesting. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) deposition and its ecological effects on forest ecosystems have received global attention. Plantations play an important role in mitigating climate change through assimilating atmospheric CO2. However, the mechanisms by which increasing N additions affect net ecosystem production (NEP) of plantations remain poorly understood. A field experiment was initialized in May 2009, which incorporated additions of four rates of N (control (no N addition), low-N (5 g N m-2 yr-1), medium-N (10 g N m -2 yr-1), and high-N (15 g N m-2 yr -1)) at the Saihanba Forestry Center, Hebei Province, northern China, a locality that contains the largest area of plantations in China. Net primary production (NPP), soil respiration, and its autotrophic and heterotrophic components were measured. Plant tissue carbon (C) and N concentrations (including foliage, litter, and fine roots), microbial biomass, microbial community composition, extracellular enzyme activities, and soil pH were also measured. N addition significantly increased NPP, which was associated with increased litter N concentrations. Autotrophic respiration (AR) increased but heterotrophic respiration (HR) decreased in the high N compared with the medium N plots, although the HR in high and medium N plots did not significantly differ from that in the control. The increased AR may derive from mycorrhizal respiration and rhizospheric microbial respiration, not live root respiration, because fine root biomass and N concentrations showed no significant differences. Although the HR was significantly suppressed in the high-N plots, soil microbial biomass, composition, or activity of extracellular enzymes were not significantly changed. Reduced pH with fertilization also could not explain the pattern of HR. The reduction of HR may be related to altered microbial C use efficiency. NEP was significantly enhanced by N addition, from 149 to 426.6 g C m-2 yr-1. Short-term N addition may significantly enhance the role of plantations as an important C sink. {\textcopyright} 2014 Du et al.

AB  - The mycorrhizal status of a group of caesalpinioid legumes in lowland rain‐forest in Korup National Park, SW Cameroon, was examined. Species in ten genera, Anthonotha, Aphanocalyx, Berlinia, Didelotia, Gilbertiodendron, Julbernardia, Microberlinia, Monopetalanthus, Tetraberlinia(tribe Amherstieae) and Afzelia(tribe Detarieae) were ectomycorrhizal. These species were not uniformly distributed in the forest, and three large emergent species Microberlinia bisulcata A. Chev., Tetraberlinia bifoliolata(Harms) Hauman, and T. moreliana Aubr. in particular appear to form groves c. 600 m across. This type of distribution may be related to the ectomycorrhizal habit. A previous large scale enumeration and soil survey on four 5 km transects of plots in the forest, carried out during the wet season, had revealed an association between these ectomycorrhizal legumes and low concentrations ( 5 $\mu$g g‐1) of extractable phosphorus in the mineral soil. In the current study part of one of the original transects in a low phosphorus area of the forest, where ectomycorrhizal trees comprise 29 % of the basal area, was resampled at the subplot level during the dry season. Whereas in the wet season soil phosphorus had been lower (2{\textperiodcentered}8 $\mu$g g‐1) within the ectomycorrhizal groves than without (3{\textperiodcentered}8 $\mu$g g‐1), in the dry season the situation was reversed and the overall concentrations were higher (12{\textperiodcentered}3 and 7{\textperiodcentered}9 $\mu$g g‐1 respectively). Ordination analysis re‐affirmed the association of the three Microberlina/Tetraberlinia species with relatively low concentrations of extractable phosphorus in the wet season but relatively high ones in the dry season. The groves are characterized by high inputs of leaf litter in the dry season, extensive colonization of surface organic matter by ectomycorrhizas and hyphal strands, and high carbon: extractable inorganic phosphorus ratios in the mineral soil in the wet season. These features are discussed in relation to the presumed ability of ectomycorrhizas to utilize organic phosphorus. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1988, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Pinus greggii Engelm. ex Parl. is an endemic pine of Mexico with notorious adaptability to eroded, shallow and poor soils. It is widely used in reforestation programmes worldwide. The purpose of the present study is to develop an ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) treatment with different native ectomycorrhizal fungal species (collected in P. greggii and Abies vejarii stands) to improve seedling survival of P. greggii. Four-month-old P. greggii var. greggii seedlings were inoculated with ground fruiting bodies of the ECM species Astraeus spp., Boletus barrowsii, Geastrum minimum, Lactarius deliciosus var. deterrimus, Russula cf. atroglauca, Russula spp., Suillus caerulescens, as well as a mixture of three species (Russula sp., R. lutea and L. deliciosus) and soil litter with mycelium from the base of a fruiting body of L. deliciosus. Agronomic variables, and total phosphorous and glucosamine contents were measured in P. greggii seedlings. Inoculated treatments with B. barrowsii, Geastrum minimum and S. caerulescens showed increases in seedling height and basal diameter as well as dry shoot biomass compared with those of the control plants. Geastrum minimum, B. barrowsii and R. xerampelina significantly increased values of dry weight compared with that of the control. Inoculation of soil litter from the base of a fruiting body of L. deliciosus induced the maximum glucosamine response (40.2 mg g −1 of dry root biomass). Geastrum minimum, a fungus collected in P. greggii stands, enhanced basal diameter of pine seedlings in the nursery. Fungal species B. barrowsii, Suillus caerulescens, Russula cf. atroglauca and Russula spp. from the Abies forest improved plant quality in terms of the Dickson quality index and root and shoot biomass, compared with those of the control. {\textcopyright} 2019, {\textcopyright} 2019 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - N-15 natural abundances of soil total N, roots and mycorrhizas were studied in surface soil profiles in coniferous and broadleaved forests along a transect from central to northern Europe. Under conditions of N limitation in Sweden, there was an increase in delta(15)N of soil total N of up to 9 parts per thousand from the uppermost horizon of the organic mor layer down to the upper 0-5 cm of the mineral soil. The delta(15)N of roots was only slightly lower than that of soil total N in the upper organic horizon, but further down roots were up to 5 parts per thousand depleted under such conditions. In experimentally N-enriched forest in Sweden, i.e. in plots which have received an average of c. 100 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) for 20 years and which retain less than 50\% of this added N in the stand and the soil down to 20 cm depth, and in some forests in central Europe, the increase in delta(15)N with depth in soil total N was smaller. An increase in delta(15)N of the surface soil was even observed on experimentally N-enriched plots, although other data suggest that the N fertilizer added was depleted in N-15. In such cases roots could be enriched in N-15 relative to soil total N, suggesting that labelling of the surf ace soil is via the pathway: - available pools of N plant N - litter N. Under N-limiting conditions roots of different species sampled from the same soil horizon showed similar delta(15)N. By contrast, in experimentally N-enriched forest delta(15)N of roots increased in the sequence: ericaceous dwarf shrubs<Scots pine<grass, suggesting increasing use of inorganic N along the sequence. Complementary studies at the major transect sites had shown that 90-99\% of fine tree roots had ectomycorrhizas (ECMs). ECMs were 2 parts per thousand more enriched than corresponding non-mycorrhizal fine roots. Fungal stripped off ECMs were 2.4-6.4 parts per thousand enriched relative to the remaining root core. It is suggested that a flux of N through ECMs to aboveground pasts in N-limited forests would leave N-15 enriched compounds in fungal material, which could contribute to explain the observed delta(15)N profiles if fungal material is enriched, because it is a precursor of stable organic matter and recalcitrant N. This could act in addition to the previous explanation of the isotopically lighter soil surface in forests: plant uptake of N-15-depleted N and its redeposition onto the soil surface by litter-fall.

AB  - Diversity and storage function of mycorrhiza as well as soil organoprofile formation were investigated in a chronosequence of a pure Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand, of Scots pine stands that were underplanted with beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and in three pure beech stands of different age. Mycorrhiza diversity was higher in the pure beech stands compared to the pure pine stand. Beech and pine trees in the mixed stands had similar dominant mycorrhiza morphotypes. However, trees in two of the three pure beech stands were mycorrhized with other types. Mycorrhizal abundance and nutrient amounts of mycorrhizae associated with beech trees were higher in the mixed and in the pure beech stands compared to pine mycorrhizae indicating that nutrient uptake was higher in older beech than in older pine trees. Humus quality varied from pine to beech stands. Plant litter storage in the humus layer was highest in the youngest mixed stand and lowest in the oldest beech stand. Humus forms changed from moder grass-type in the pure Scots pine stand to mor-like moder and moder rich in fine humus with increasing age of beeches in the mixed stands. The older beech stands were characterised by oligomull and mull-like moder as the dominating humus forms. The ecologically favourable humus forms, i.e., nutrient rich humus forms in the older beech stands correlate well with the higher mycorrhizal diversity and abundance as well as the higher nutrient storage of their mycorrhizae in these stands. The results are also discussed with regard to the 'base-pump effect' of beech trees. {\textcopyright} 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - An introduction to the results of fungal expeditions in the highland areas of Kenya (East Africa), such as Mt. Kenya, Aberdare Mts., Mt. Elgon, Kikuyu Escarpment, Ngong Hills is given. For the comparision of the fungal flora of the lower parts of Kenya fungi were collected and studied in the tropical lowland rain forest of Kakamega (Western Kenya) and in the Nairobi City park. Proof of 161 species of Macrofungi and ten Myxomycetes species is given. Different compositions of fungal species are characteristic to the higher plants vegetation in lowland rain forests, afromontane rain forests (Podocarpus-forest, Arundinaria-zone), afroalpine vegetation and pine plantations. Lists of species are given and discussed. The fungal vegetation of the afromontane zone consists of some fungi distributed in the Tropics and also basidiomycetous species of the temperate zones. In higher mountain altitudes more temperate species can be found in habitats with an ecology similar to that in the temperate zone. Most of the members of the fungal vegetation collected in the pine plantations (mycorrhizal, litter decomposing wood inhabiting species) may have been introduced from foreign areas from which the planted trees came. In these areas, the indigenous fungal flora was substituted by introduced species as was the virgin forest was replaced by artificial forest plantations.

AB  - The importance of developing multi-disciplinary approaches to solving problems relating to anthropogenic pollution is now clearly appreciated by the scientific community, and this is especially evident in boreal ecosystems exposed to escalating threats of petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) contamination through expanded natural resource extraction activities. This review aims to synthesize information regarding the fate and behaviour of PHCs in boreal forest soils in both ecological and sustainable management contexts. From this, we hope to evaluate potential management strategies, identify gaps in knowledge and guide future research. Our central premise is that mycorrhizal systems, the ubiquitous root symbiotic fungi and associated food-web communities, occupy the structural and functional interface between decomposition and primary production in northern forest ecosystems (i.e. underpin survival and productivity of the ecosystem as a whole), and, as such, are an appropriate focal point for such a synthesis. We provide pertinent basic information about mycorrhizas, followed by insights into the ecology of ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal systems. Next, we review the fate and behaviour of PHCs in forest soils, with an emphasis on interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and associated bacteria. Finally, we summarize implications for ecosystem management. Although we have gained tremendous insights into understanding linkages between ecosystem functions and the various aspects of mycorrhizal diversity, very little is known regarding rhizosphere communities in PHC-contaminated soils. This makes it difficult to translate ecological knowledge into environmental management strategies. Further research is required to determine which fungal symbionts are likely to survive and compete in various ecosystems, whether certain fungal - plant associations gain in ecological importance following contamination events, and how PHC contamination may interfere with processes of nutrient acquisition and exchange and metabolic processes. Research is also needed to assess whether the metabolic capacity for intrinsic decomposition exists in these ecosystems, taking into account ecological variables such as presence of other organisms (and their involvement in syntrophic biodegradation), bioavailability and toxicity of mixtures of PHCs, and physical changes to the soil environment. {\textcopyright} 2007 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

AB  - Fungi are vital within forest ecosystems through their mycorrhizal relationships with trees, and as the main agents of wood decomposition and thus carbon and nutrient cycling. Globally, forests are becoming increasingly fragmented, creating forest patches that are isolated, reduced in area, and exposed at edges. Edges are often ecologically distinct from the forest interior due to their exposure to the matrix habitat. This exposure can result in altered microclimatic conditions and flows of biotic and abiotic materials such as spores or inorganic nitrogen, respectively.Although fungi are known to be affected by microclimate and nitrogen deposition, knowledge of forest edge effects on fungi is extremely limited; however, a consideration of the factors known to regulate fungal activity in combination with known biotic and abiotic edge effects implies that forest edges are likely to strongly influence fungi. These include responses of fungi to the altered microclimate and nitrogen levels at forest edges, at both the individual and community level; interactions with plants and animals that have been influenced by edges; above-belowground feedback between mycorrhizal fungi and host trees. The small body of existing research focuses on fruit body presence and distribution; fungal biomass and community composition in soil have been touched upon. Positive, negative and neutral edge responses have been found, the majority of studies finding a significant effect on some of the parameters measured. Generally, abundance of fruit bodies and biomass in the soil is lower at the forest edge.Understanding how fungi respond to edges is essential to a more complete knowledge of carbon and nitrogen cycling in forest edges, influence of mycorrhizal species on vegetation, and conservation of rare fungi. As edges become increasingly dominant landscape features it is vital to investigate processes within them, to understand ecosystem function at a landscape scale. {\textcopyright} 2012 The British Mycological Society.

AB  - The supply of nitrogen commonly limits plant production in boreal forests and also affects species composition and ecosystem functions other than plant growth. These interrelations vary across the landscapes, with the highest N availability, plant growth and plant species richness in ground-water discharge areas (GDAs), typically in toe-slope positions, which receive solutes leaching from the much larger groundwater recharge areas (GRAs) uphill. Plant N sources include not only inorganic N, but, as heightened more recently, also organic N species. In general, also the ratio inorganic N over organic N sources increase down hillslopes. Here, we review recent evidence about the nature of the N limitation and its variations in Fennoscandian boreal forests and discuss its implications for forest ecology and management. The rate of litter decomposition has traditionally been seen as the determinant of the rate of N supply. However, while N-rich litter decomposes faster than N-poor litter initially, N-rich litter then decomposes more slowly, which means that the relation between N \% of litter and its decomposability is complex. Moreover, in the lower part of themor-layer, where the most superficial mycorrhizal roots first appear, and N availability matters for plants, the ratio of microbial N over total soil N is remarkably constant over the wide range in litter and soil C/N ratios of between 15 and 40 for N-rich and N-poor sites, respectively. Nitrogen-rich and-poor sites thus differ in the sizes of the total N pool and the microbial N pool, but not in the ratio between them. A more important difference is that the soil microbial N pool turns over faster in N -rich systems because the microbes are more limited by C, while microbes in N-poor systems are a stronger sink for available N. Furthermore, litter decomposition in the most superficial soil horizon (as studied by the so-called litter-bag method) is associated with a dominance of saprotrophic fungi, and absence of mycorrhizal fungi. The focal zone in the context of plant N supply in N-limited forests is further down the soil profile, whereectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots become abundant. Molecular evidence and stable isotope data indicate that in the typical N-poor boreal forests, nitrogen is retained in saprotrophic fungi, likely until they run out of energy (available C-compounds). Then, as heightened by recent research, ECM fungi, which are supplied by photosynthate from the trees, become the superior competitors for N. In N-poor boreal soils strong N retention by microorganisms keeps levels of available N very low. This is exacerbated by an increase in tree C allocation to mycorrhizal fungi (TCAM) relative to net primary production (NPP) with decreasing soil N supply, which causes ECM fungi to retain much of the available soil N for their own growth and transfer little to their tree hosts. The transfer of N through the ECM fungi, and not the rate of litter decomposition, is likely limiting the rate of tree N supply under such conditions. All but a few stress-tolerant less N-demanding plant species, like the ECM trees themselves and ericaceous dwarf shrubs, are excluded. With increasing N supply, a weakening of ECM symbiosis caused by the relative decline in TCAM contributes to shifts in soil microbial community composition from fungal dominance to bacterial dominance. Thus, bacteria, which are less C-demanding, but more likely to release N than fungi, take over. This, and the relatively high pH in GDA, allow autotrophic nitrifying bacteria to compete successfully for the NH4+ released by C-limited organisms and causes the N cycle to open up with leaching of nitrate (NO) and gaseous N losses through denitrification. These N-rich conditions allow species-rich communities of N-demanding plant species. Meanwhile, ECM fungi have a smaller biomass, are supplied with N in excess of their demand and will export more N to their host trees. Hence, the gradient from low to high N supply is characterized by profound variations in plant and soil microbial physiologies, especially their relations to the C-to-N supply ratio. We propose how interactions among functional groups can be understood and modelled (the plant-microbe carbon-nitrogen model). With regard to forest management these perspectives explain why the creation of larger tree-free gaps favors the regeneration of tree seedlings under N-limited conditions through reduced belowground competition for N, and why such gaps are less important under high N supply (but when light might be limiting). We also discuss perspectives on the relations between N supply, biodiversity, and eutrophication of boreal forests from N deposition or forest fertilization. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Soil food webs play an important role in forest ecosystem functions that may be sensitive to global environmental change. We traced a pulse of C-13 from the root systems of young sugar maple stands through the soil food web to explore energy flow from roots to soil heterotrophs. Invasive earthworms (Lumbricidae) were the most highly-enriched taxa sampled, indicating that they were consuming significant quantities of live fine roots and mycorrhizae and assimilating significant amounts of root-derived C. Another invasive invertebrate, a weevil (Barypeithes pellucidus) also appeared to consume significant amounts of roots or root-derived C. High isotope enrichment in ants (Formicidae) may reflect their feeding on phloem-sucking coccids in soil. All the predators collected from the litter layer also exhibited high isotope enrichment, including the salamander Plethodon cinereus. Moreover, in the absence of invasive earthworms all the taxa of animals collected from surface soil were similarly highly-enriched in root-derived isotopes. The apparent importance of the root channel in supplying energy to the soil food web suggests that forest ecosystem functions could be highly sensitive to global changes that alter proportional tree C allocation belowground.

AB  - Fungal succession on various plants from different regions of the world have been well-studied, however there has been no report comparing the fungi on leaves of a climber with those of the supportive plant. Fungi on leaves of Berchemia floribunda, a climber, were studied to fungal diversity and succession over a period of leaf decomposition. These fungi were compared with those on leaves of Magnolia liliifera, the supportive plant, using data from previous studies at the same site. Leaves of B. floribunda were placed with the upper or lower leaf surface adjacent to the forest floor, hung above the ground either under the host tree or other tree species, or placed on the forest floor under the host tree or under other trees to establish the effects of these treatments. These leaf bait trials did not affect the fungal diversity on the leaves. There was very little overlap between fungi on the climber leaves and those on the support tree. Only four saprobes from B. floribunda were also found on leaves of M. liliifera. We suspect that most of the fungi degrading leaves of B. floribunda were initially endophytes and became active saprobes once leaves started to decay. {\textcopyright} Guizhou Key Laboratory of Agricultural Biotechnology.

AB  - The availability and the quality of substrates are important drivers of macrofungal biogeography, and thus macrofungal species occurrence is potentially dependent on the availability of different substrates. However, few studies have explored the properties of macrofungal substrates and assessed the relationship between macrofungal diversity and substrate diversity at a landscape level. To address this issue, we conducted a landscape-scale survey of basidiocarp substrates in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). A total of 957 macrofungal species distributed across 73 families and 189 genera were collected. Substrates of these macrofungi were categorized into four main groups (namely, litter, soil, root, and rare substrates) and referenced into 14 sub-substrate types (such as branches, leaves, and fruit). The results revealed that 50% of the observed macrofungal species were symbiotrophs living in ectomycorrhizal association with plant hosts, 30% were saprotrophs decomposing plant litter, 15% lived in soil organic matter, and 5% lived in rare substrates. The most abundant root symbiotic fungi were members of Russula, whereas most litter saprotrophic fungi belonged to Marasmius. Macrofungi commonly favored a single substrate. This specificity was not affected by changes in vegetation or climate. Less than 1% of macrofungi (e.g., Marasmius aff. maximus) could live on multiple substrates. Most of these unusual macrofungi were characterized as highly mobile and were generally found in successional areas. In secondary forests, our survey indicated that significant correlations exist between substrate preference and taxonomic diversity, reflected as higher substrate diversity generally accompanied by higher macrofungal diversity. In conclusion, substrate preference is an important factor driving macrofungal composition and distribution in the GMS. Macrofungi that thrive on multiple substrates constitute pioneer groups that have an important role in establishing macrofungal communities in new habitats. These observations have furthered our understanding of how substrate preferences could explain macrofungal biogeography. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The species of an ectomycorrhizal (ECM) community were investigated in a temperate oak forest by morphotyping and ITS rDNA sequencing. Thirty-six ECM morphotypes were found at the site. The niche effect (as organic soil, mineral soil or dead woody debris artificially introduced in the soil) on the ECM community structure and on the potential catabolic activities of the most abundant morphotypes was studied. The morphotypes in each niche were subjected to enzymatic tests developed for hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes involved in the decomposition of organic compounds. The ECM community structure varied widely depending on the soil horizon or habitat patch. The species richness was higher in the A1 horizon than in the other niches. Different ECM species had different activity patterns for the eight enzymatic tests while co-occurring in the same niche. Catabolic activities also changed within species between niches. Dead woody debris were extensively colonized by two saprotrophic fungi (Megacollybia platyphylla and Armillaria sp.) and, in this particular niche, ECM morphotypes predominantly belonged to the genera Lactarius and Tomentella. These morphotypes showed high chitinase activities. This study suggested also that some ECM fungi could obtain nutrients via the chitin degradation of dead or live saprobes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The primary objective of this paper is to study the interspecific variation of N-15 natural abundance in two dominant conifer tree species, Scot pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) in a N-limited mixed boreal coniferous forest in southern Finland. Both a mature tree stand (a natural forest stand) and a stand of seedlings in a clear-cut area were considered. We analyzed \%N and delta N-15 natural abundance in needles, branches, litter and soil of the both above-mentioned stands. Pine needles had higher N concentrations than spruce needles, both in mature forest (pine 1.09\%, SE +/- 0.02 and spruce = 0.79\%, SE +/- 0.02) and in the clear-cut area (pine = 1.01\%, SE +/- 0.07 and spruce 0.74\%, SE +/- 0.04). Furthermore, pine needles were significantly more depleted in delta N-15 natural abundance than the spruce needles, both in the mature forest (pine = -5.6 parts per thousand, SE +/- 0.1 parts per thousand and spruce = -4.0 parts per thousand, SE +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) and in the clear-cut sites (pine = -2.8 parts per thousand, SE +/- 0.2 parts per thousand and spruce = -2.1 parts per thousand, SE +/- 0.3 parts per thousand). The more pronounced depletion of 15N in the pine foliage might be connected to its different fungal associates in the roots compared to spruce roots. We assume that the mycorrhizal N-uptake is very prominent at the N-limited site. After clear-cutting, needles of the seedlings and the uppermost part of soil organic layer were found to be more N-15-enriched than at the natural forest site. This was attributed to an increased level of nitrification in the clear-cut site soil.

AB  - Elevational gradients strongly affect microbial biodiversity in bulk soil through altering plant and soil properties, but the effects on rhizosphere microbial patterns remain unclear, especially at large spatial scales. We therefore designed an elevational gradient experiment to examine rhizosphere microbial (bacteria, fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) diversity and composition using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA and ITS genes for comparison to plant and soil properties. Our results showed that bacterial and fungal alpha diversity was significantly higher at mid-elevation, while AMF alpha diversity decreased monotonically. The beta diversities of the three groups were significantly affected by elevational gradients, but the effect on bacterial beta diversity was larger than on fungal and AMF beta diversity. Proteobacteria, the dominant phyla of bacteria, was significantly higher at the mid-elevation, while Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria significantly decreased as elevation increased. The main fungal taxa, Basidiomycota, significantly decreased with elevation, and Ascomycota significantly increased with elevation. Glomeromycota, the dominant AMF phyla, responded insignificantly to the elevational gradients. The responses of bacterial and fungal alpha diversity were mostly associated with tree diversity and organic carbon, whereas AMF alpha diversity mainly depended on litter N and P. Changes in bacterial community composition along the elevational gradient were explained primarily by litter N and P, and litter P was the main driver of fungal and AMF community composition. Overall, our results suggest that plant litter, particularly litter N and P, were the main source of external carbon input and drove the observed differences in rhizosphere microbial diversity and community composition. Our results highlight the importance of litter nutrition in structuring rhizosphere microbial communities in mountain ecosystems. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020 Guo, Ren, Yi, Doughty and Zhao.

AB  - Carbon sequestration below ground depends on organic matter input and decomposition, but regulatory bottlenecks remain unclear. The relative importance of plant production, climate and edaphic factors has to be elucidated to better predict carbon storage in forests. In Swedish forest soil inventory data from across the entire boreal latitudinal range (n = 2378), the concentration of exchangeable manganese was singled out as the strongest predictor (R2 = 0.26) of carbon storage in the extensive organic horizon (mor layer), which accounts for one third of the total below ground carbon. In comparison, established ecosystem models applied on the same data have failed to predict carbon stocks (R2 < 0.05), and in our study manganese availability overshadowed both litter production and climatic factors. We also identified exchangeable potassium as an additional strong predictor, however strongly correlated with manganese. The negative correlation between manganese and carbon highlights the importance of Mn-peroxidases in oxidative decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter. The results support the idea that the fungus-driven decomposition could be a critical factor regulating humus carbon accumulation in boreal forests, as Mn-peroxidases are specifically produced by basidiomycetes. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The majority of nitrogen in forest soils is found in organic matter-protein complexes. Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are thought to have a key role in decomposing and mobilizing nitrogen from such complexes. However, little is known about the mechanisms governing these processes, how they are regulated by the carbon in the host plant and the availability of more easily available forms of nitrogen sources. Here we used spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome profiling to examine how the presence or absence of glucose and/or ammonium regulates decomposition of litter material and nitrogen mobilization by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus. We found that the assimilation of nitrogen and the decomposition of the litter material are triggered by the addition of glucose. Glucose addition also resulted in upregulation of the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in oxidative degradation of polysaccharides and polyphenols, peptidases, nitrogen transporters and enzymes in pathways of the nitrogen and carbon metabolism. In contrast, the addition of ammonium to organic matter had relatively minor effects on the expression of transcripts and the decomposition of litter material, occurring only when glucose was present. On the basis of spectroscopic analyses, three major types of chemical modifications of the litter material were observed, each correlated with the expression of specific sets of genes encoding extracellular enzymes. Our data suggest that the expression of the decomposition and nitrogen assimilation processes of EMF can be tightly regulated by the host carbon supply and that the availability of inorganic nitrogen as such has limited effects on saprotrophic activities. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Microbial Ecology.

AB  - Based on litter mass and litterfall data, decomposition rates for leaves were found to be fast (k = 3.3) and the turnover times short (3.6 mo) on the low-nutrient sandy soils of Korup. Leaf litter of four ectomycorrhizal tree species (Berlinia bracteosa, Didelotia africana, Microberlinia bisulcata and Tetraberlinia bifoliolata) and of three non-ectomycorrhizal species (Cola verticillata, Oubanguia alata and Strephonema pseudocola) from Korup were left to decompose in 2-mm mesh bags on the forest floor in three plots of each of two forest types forest of low (LEM) and high (HEM) abundance of ectomycorrhizal (caesalp) trees. The litter of the ectomycorrhizal species decayed at a significantly slower rate than that of the non-ectomycorrhizal species, although the former were richer in P and N concentrations of the start. Disappearance rates of the litter layer showed a similar trend. Ectomycorrhizal species immobilized less N, but mineralized more P, than non-ectomycorrhizal species. Differences between species groups in K, Mg and Ca mineralization were negligible. Effect of forest type was clear only for Mg: mineralization of Mg was faster in the HEM than LEM plots, a pattern repeated across all species. This difference was attributed to a much more prolific fine root mat in the HEM than LEM forest. The relatively fast release of P from the litter of the ectomycorrhizal species suggests that the mat must allow an efficient uptake to maintain P in the forest ecosystem.

AB  - Natural abundances of nitrogen isotopes, $\delta$15N, indicate that, in the same habitat, Alaskan Picea glauca and P. mariana use a different soil nitrogen compartment from the evergreen shrub Vaccinium vitis-idaea or the deciduous grass Calamagrostis canadensis. The very low $\delta$15N values (-7.7 ‰) suggest that (1) Picea mainly uses inorganic nitrogen (probably mainly ammonium) or organic N in fresh litter, (2) Vaccinium (-4.3 ‰) with its ericoid mycorrhizae uses more stable organic matter, and (3) Calamagrostis (+0.9 ‰) exploits deeper soil horizons with higher $\delta$15N values of soil N. We conclude that species limited by the same nutrient may coexist by drawing on different pools of soil N in a nutrient-deficient environment. The differences among life-forms decrease with increasing N availability. The different levels of $\delta$15N are associated with different nitrogen concentrations in leaves, Picea having a lower N concentration (0.62 mmol g-1) than Vaccinium (0.98 mmol g-1) or Calamagrostis (1.33 mmol g-1). An extended vector analysis by Timmer and Armstrong (1987) suggests that N is the most limiting element for Picea in this habitat, causing needle yellowing at N concentrations below 0.5 mmol g-1 or N contents below 2 mmol needle-1. Increasing N supply had an exponential effect on twig and needle growth. Phosphorus, potassium and magnesium are at marginal supply, but no interaction between ammonium supply and needle Mg concentration could be detected. Calcium is in adequate supply on both calcareous and acidic soils. The results are compared with European conditions of excessive N supply from anthropogenic N depositions. {\textcopyright} 1994 Springer Verlag.

AB  - The cycling of phosphorus was studied in a 3-year-old plantation of Acacia holosericea (1111 trees ha-1). Over a 13-month period, the gross demand by the plantation for phosphorus was estimated to be 1260 g ha-1. Of this, 17% was supplied through biochemical cycling within the plants and the balance was obtained from the soil. Of the total phosphorus in the phyllodes, approximately 85% was remobilized into the tree before phyllode fall. A total of 148 g P ha-1 was estimated to be cycled in litter over the study period. Topsoil samples collected from several points within the Eucalyptus tetrodonta open-forest contained three mycorrhizal Endogone spore types. Type GE1 appeared to be a strain of Gigaspora gilmoreii, type GE2 was an undescribed Gigaspora species and type GE3 was similar to Gigaspora gigantea. Only one sporocarpic Endogone species was found which was similar to Sclerocystis coremioides. Type GE1 was the dominant type in the E. tetrodonta open-forest and significantly greater numbers of it occurred around the roots of native legumes in a survey which included Brachysema uniflora, Calopogonium mucunioides, Galactia tenuiflora, Acacia aulacocarpa, A. holosericea, A. latescens, A. torulosa and A. yirrkallensis. All the plants examined except Eucalyptus tetrodonta, Calytrix laricina and Rhychelytrum repens were infected by vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The results of this study suggest that the infection of plant species by mycorrhizal fungi is a prerequisite for successful long-term vegetation establishment on areas rehabilitated after mining. {\textcopyright} 1982 CSIRO.

AB  - The relative roles of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic communities in controlling the decomposition of soil organic matter remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis that ECM community structure and activity influences the breakdown of nutrient-rich biopolymers in soils, while saprotrophic communities primarily regulate the breakdown of carbon-rich biopolymers. To test this hypothesis, we used high-throughput techniques to measure ECM and saprotrophic community structure, soil resource availability, and extracellular enzyme activity in whole soils and on ECM root tips in a coastal pine forest. We found that ECM and saprotroph richness did not show spatial structure and did not co-vary with any soil resource. However, species richness of ECM fungi explained variation in the activity of enzymes targeting recalcitrant N sources (protease and peroxidase) in bulk soil. Activity of carbohydrate- and organic P- targeting enzymes (e.g. cellobiohydrolase, $\beta$-glucosidase, $\alpha$-glucosidase, hemicellulases, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, and acid phosphatase) was correlated with saprotroph community structure and soil resource abundance (total soil C, N, and moisture), both of which varied along the soil profile. These observations suggest independent roles of ECM fungi and saprotrophic fungi in the cycling of N-rich, C-rich, and P-rich molecules through soil organic matter. Enzymatic activity on ECM root tips taken from the same soil cores used for bulk enzyme analysis did not correlate with the activity of any enzyme measured in the bulk soil, suggesting that ECM contributions to larger-scale soil C and nutrient cycling may occur primarily via extramatrical hyphae outside the rhizosphere. {\textcopyright} 2012.

AB  - The response of temperate forest ecosystems to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations is important because these ecosystems represent a significant component of the global carbon cycle. Two important but not well understood processes which elevated CO2 may substantially alter in these systems are regeneration and nitrogen cycling. If elevated CO2 leads to changes in species composition in regenerating forest communities then the structure and function of these ecosystems may be affected. In most temperate forests, nitrogen appears to be a limiting nutrient. If elevated CO2 leads to reductions in nitrogen cycling through increased sequestration of nitrogen in plant biomass or reductions in mineralization rates, long-term forest productivity may be constrained. To study these processes, we established mesocosms of regenerating forest communities in controlled environments maintained at either ambient (375 ppm) or elevated (700 ppm) CO2 concentrations. Mesocosms were constructed from intact monoliths of organic forest soil. We maintained these mesocosms for 2 years without any external inputs of nitrogen and allowed the plants naturally present as seeds and rhizomes to regenerate. We used 15N pool dilution techniques to quantify nitrogen fluxes within the mesocosms at the end of the 2 years. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration significantly affected a number of plant and soil processes in the experimental regenerating forest mesocosms. These changes included increases in total plant biomass production, plant C/N ratios, ectomycorrhizal colonization of tree fine roots, changes in tree fine root architecture, and decreases in plant NH4/+ uptake rates, gross NH4/+ mineralization rates, and gross NH4/+ consumption rates. In addition, there was a shift in the relative biomass contribution of the two dominant regenerating tree species; the proportion of total biomass contributed by white birch (Betula papyrifera) decreased and the proportion of total biomass contributed by yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis) increased. However, elevated CO2 had no significant effect on the total amount of nitrogen in plant and soil microbial biomass. In this study we observed a suite of effects due to elevated CO2, some of which could lead to increases in potential long term growth responses to elevated CO2, other to decreases. The reduced plant NH4/+ uptake rates we observed are consistent with reduced NH4/+ availability due to reduced gross mineralization rates. Reduced NH4/+ mineralization rates are consistent with the increases in C/N ratios we observed for leaf and fine root material. Together, these data suggest the positive increases in plant root architectural parameters and mycorrhizal colonization may not be as important as the potential negative effects of reduced nitrogen availability through decreased decomposition rates in a future atmosphere with elevated CO2.

AB  - Plant nutrient-acquisition strategies drive soil processes and vegetation performance, but their effect on the soil microbiome remains poorly understood. This knowledge is important to predict the shifts in microbial diversity and functions due to increasing changes in vegetation traits under global change. Here we documented the topsoil microbiomes of 145 boreal and temperate terrestrial sites in the Baltic region that broadly differed in vegetation type and nutritional traits, such as mycorrhizal types and symbiotic nitrogen-fixation. We found that sites dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) vegetation harbor relatively more AM fungi, bacteria, fungal saprotrophs, and pathogens in the topsoil compared with sites dominated by ectomycorrhizal (EM) plants. These differences in microbiome composition reflect the rapid nutrient cycling and negative plant–soil feedback in AM soils. Lower fungal diversity and bacteria : fungi ratios in EM-dominated habitats are driven by monodominance of woody vegetation as well as soil acidification by EM fungi, which are associated with greater diversity and relative abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes. Our study suggests that shifts in vegetation related to global change and land use may strongly alter the topsoil microbiome structure and function. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Carbon and mineral cycling in sustainable forest systems depends on a microbiome of basidiomycetes, ascomycetes, litter-degrading saprobes, ectomycorrhizal, and mycoparasitic fungi that constitute a deadwood degrading consortium. The brown rot basidiomycete Fomitopsis pinicola (Swartz: Fr.) P. Karsten (Fp), as an oxalate-producing facultative pathogen, is an early colonizer of wounded trees and fresh deadwood. It replaces basidiomycetous white rot fungi and nonbasidiomycetous fungal phyla in the presence of its volatilome, but poorly in its absence. With the goal of determining its dominance over the most competitive basidiomycetes and its role in fungal successions within the forest microbiome in general, Fp was exposed to the white rot fungus Kuehneromyces mutabilis (Schaeff.: Fr.) Singer & Smith (Km) in aseptic dual culture established on fertilized 100 mm-long wood dust columns in glass tubes with the inclusion of their volatilomes. For the mycelia approaching from the opposite ends of the wood dust columns, the energygenerating systems of laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP), the virulence factor oxalate, and the exhalation of terpenes were determined by spectrophotometry, High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Km mycelia perceived the approaching Fp over 20 mm of non-colonized wood dust, reduced the laccase activity to 25%, and raised MnP to 275%-500% by gaining energy and presumably by controlling oxalate, H2O2, and the dropping substrate pH caused by Fp. On mycelial contact, Km stopped Fp, secured its substrate sector with 4 mm of an impermeable barrier region during an eruption of antimicrobial bisabolenes, and dropped from the invasion mode of substrate colonization into the steady state mode of low metabolic and defensive activity. The approaching Fp raised the oxalate production throughout to > 20g kg-1 to inactivate laccase and caused, with pH 1.4-1.7, lethal conditions in its substrate sector whose physiological effects on Km could be reproduced with acidity conditions incited by HCl. After a mean lag phase of 11 days, Fp persisting in a state of high metabolic activity overgrew and digested the debilitated Km thallus and terminated the production of oxalate. It is concluded that the factors contributing to the competitive advantage of F. pinicola in the colonization of wounded trees and pre-infected deadwood are the drastic long-term acidification of the timber substrate, its own insensitivity to extremely low pH conditions, its efficient control of the volatile mono-and sesquiterpenes of timber and microbial origin, and the action of a undefined blend of terpenes and allelopathic substances. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the author.

AB  - Basidiomycete fruitbodies growing in coniferous forests along a complex heavy metal pollution gradient in north Sweden were identified and counted over a 4 yr period. The dominant metals in the humus layer were As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Pb occurred at the highest levels in a range of 80 to 8500 $\mu$g g-1 dry wt. Both the number of fruitbodies and the number of fruiting species decreased strongly with increasing pollution level. A few species appeared to sustain the metal loads. Many of these were ectomycorrhizal fungi. The relationship between fruitbody frequencies and plant species composition were also studied statistically although no obvious relations were found. Metal content of the fruitbodies of six species were also analyzed and their bioaccumulation calculated. Amanita muscaria accumulated Cd efficiently. {\textcopyright} 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - There are many alterations in the composition and development of plants on Camels Hump Mountain. Simulation studies show that acidic, metal-containing precipitations are capable of causing alterations in the growth and metabolism of components of these ecosystems. It is alterations to determine how far the laboratory data can be extrapolated to relate it to the data obtained in the field. The decline and death of red spruce, the reduction in moss coverage, the increase in litter depth, the accumulation and solubilization of metals in the soils, the absence of mycorrhiza on spruce roots and other alterations noted since the initial ecological study suggest strongly that the forests of Camels Hump are reacting to severe stresses. Studies indicate that disease or insect infestations are not involved. Acid rain is a reasonable candidate as a major perturbing influence, but the evidence is still inadequate to make a firm probability statement.

AB  - Mycorrhizae play an important role in regulating patterns of energy and nutrient flux in terrestrial ecosystems. To conceptualize this role I develop the theory behind a simple index of the efficiency of soil resource acquisition by plant root systems (E). The morphological, physiological and demographic characteristics of mycorrhizae that define E appear to vary with environment and with plant community composition. This theory is elaborated with examples drawn from forest ecology literature. Some inconsistencies among observations of fine root dynamics are particularly revealing: (1) belowground carbon allocation vs soil fertility; (2) causes of root mortality; (3) root longevity vs decomposition rates. A comprehensive theory of mycorrhizal and ecosystem dynamics must await resolution of these inconsistencies and better quantitative information on mycorrhizal features affecting E. {\textcopyright} 1992 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - 1. Soil micro-organisms play important roles in ecosystems and respond quickly to environmental changes. We examined how understory removal and tree girdling influence the composition of soil microbial community and the litter decomposition in two subtropical plantations. 2. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis was used to characterize soil microbial community. Redundancy analysis and principal response curves (PRC) were used to investigate the relationships between soil microbial community and environmental factors. 3. Understory removal significantly reduced the amount of fungal PLFAs, the ratio of fungal to bacterial PLFAs, and the litter decomposition but did not affect bacterial PLFAs and total PLFAs. In contrast, tree girdling did not affect the soil microbial characteristics. The changes in soil microbial community caused by understory removal were mainly attributed to the indirect effects such as increased soil temperature and soil NO3--N availability. In addition, PRC analysis showed that the relative abundance of most PLFAs increased in response to understory removal in the 2-year-old plantation but decreased in the 24-year-old plantation. 4. We propose that understory plants are important components in subtropical forest ecosystems, and play different roles in maintaining soil microbial community and driving litter decomposition processes in young vs. old plantations. The functions of understory plants should be considered in forest management and restoration. The negligible effect of tree girdling on the soil micro-organisms can be attributed to the resprouting trait and mycorrhizal interactions of Eucalyptus. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Because soil is a major reservoir of terrestrial carbon and a potential sink for atmospheric CO2, determining plant inputs to soil carbon is critical for understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics. We present a modified method to quantify the effects of global climate change on plant inputs of carbon to soil based on 13C:12C ratio ($\delta$ 13C) analyses that accounts for isotopic fractionation between inputs and newly created soil carbon. In a four-year study, the effects of elevated CO2 and temperature were determined for reconstructed Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga mensiezii (Mirb.) Franco) ecosystems in which native soil of low nitrogen content was used. The $\delta$13C patterns in litter and mineral soil horizons were measured and compared to $\delta$13C patterns in live needles, fine roots, and coarse roots. From regression analyses, we calculated the isotopic enrichment in 13C of newly incorporated soil carbon relative to needle and root carbon at 4‰ and 2‰, respectively. These enrichments must be considered when using shifts in soil $\delta$13C to calculate inputs of plant carbon into the soil, and are probably a major factor in the progressive enrichment in 13C with increasing depth in soil profiles. Relative to the total carbon in each layer, the proportion of new carbon from recent photosynthate in each soil layer was 13-15% in the A horizon, 7-9% in litter layers, and 4% in the B2 and C horizons. New carbon in the A horizon was estimated at 370 g C m-2. Carbon concentrations and new carbon in A horizons were correlated (r 2 = 0.78, n = 12), but with a slope of 0.356, indicating that about 36% of net carbon accumulation in the A horizon was from inputs via roots, root exudates or mycorrhizal fungi and 64% of carbon was derived from surface litter decomposition. Under the nitrogen-limited growth conditions used in this study, neither elevated CO2 nor temperature affected soil carbon sequestration patterns.

AB  - Plant nutrient acquisition strategies involving ectomycorrhizal (EcM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations, are key plant functional traits leading to distinct carbon (C) and nutrient dynamics in forests. Yet, little is known about how these strategies influence the structure and functioning of soil communities, and if such mycorrhizal effects may be more or less pronounced depending on the type of forest and various abiotic factors. Here we explore the potential interactions occurring between plant-EcM and plant-AM systems with the diverse soil organisms occurring in forest soils, and in the process draw attention to major issues that are worthy for future research directions. Based on these potential interactions, we suggest that EcM systems, especially those involving gymnosperms in colder climates, may select for a soil community with a narrow set of functions. These EcM systems may exhibit low functional redundancy, dominated by symbiotic interactions, where EcM fungi maintain low pH and high C/N conditions in order to tightly control nutrient cycling and maintain the dominance of EcM trees. By contrast, AM systems, particularly those involving deciduous angiosperm trees in mild and warmer climates, may facilitate a functionally more diverse and redundant soil community tending towards the dominance of competitive and antagonistic interactions, but also with a range of symbiotic interactions that together maintain diverse plant communities. We propose that the contrasting belowground interactions in AM and EcM systems act as extended nutrient acquisition traits that contribute greatly to the prevailing nutrient and C dynamics occurring in these systems. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - The degree to which ectomycorrhizal fungi rely on decomposing litter as a carbon source in natural ecosystems is unknown. We used a radiocarbon (14C) tracer to test for uptake of litter carbon by ectomycorrhizal fungi as part of the Enriched Background Isotope Study (EBIS) in Oak Ridge Reservation, Tennessee. In EBIS, leaf litter from a highly 14C-labeled Quercus alba (white oak) forest was reciprocally transplanted with litter from a nearby low-labeled forest that had not been as strongly exposed to 14C. These litter transplants were conducted yearly. We measured $\Delta$14C signatures of ectomycorrhizal fungi collected from each forest four months and 2.25 years after the first litter transplant. The ectomycorrhizas were associated with white oak trees. We found no significant differences in 14C signatures of ectomycorrhizal fungi exposed to low-labeled versus high-labeled litter, indicating that less than 2% of the carbon in ectomycorrhizal biomass originated from transplanted litter. In contrast, ectomycorrhizal $\Delta$14C signatures from the high-labeled forest were 117-140‰ higher than those from the low-labeled forest. This pattern suggests that ectomycorrhizal fungi acquired most (or all) of their carbon from their host plants, probably via direct transfer of photosynthate through the roots. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over the past decade, the mid-Cretaceous amber deposits of Charentes (SW France) have been intensively studied. The fossils investigated were not only limited to arthropods preserved in amber, but also included microorganisms, plant debris and vertebrate remains. This plethora of analyses provided important data about the ecology of the overall system, including sources of litter input into the soil and of the above-ground ecology. More precisely, they showed that most of the microfossils were those of soil organisms or organisms that participated in the ecology of the forest soil. This new discovery provided the opportunity to study the ecology of the soil as preserved in the 100 million years old Charentes amber. Indeed, the trophic links of the fossil forest soil have been reconstructed on the basis of the fossil assemblage discovered in amber outcrops and overlayed on a model ecological forest soil food web. We relied on existing phylogenetic information to discuss the absence of certain taxonomic groups in the fossilized specimens. Our synthesis shows that although the organisms of this ancient forest of Charentes were different from those of modern soils, the soil food web was organized functionally the same as modern soils. It also demonstrated that trophic links of the soil community were already diverse, including various means of predation, parasitism and organic matter decomposition. The most obvious differences are the absence of evidence for symbiotic root nitrogen fixation and mycorrhizae. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A new tripartite relationship among animals, fungi, and plants, based on formation of ectomycorrhiza and on removal of animal wastes, is described. In forest habitats where animal wastes such as urine or faeces or dead bodies, mainly of mammals, have been deposited, a particular group of fungi form reproductive structures successionally after the apparent decomposition of the wastes. This natural event can be simulated by application to the soil of urea, aqueous ammonia, or nitrogen compounds that release ammonia on decomposition. Both field observations and simulation experiments show that, when these events take place in forests of ectomycorrhizal trees, ectomycorrhizal fungi fruit during the late phase in the succession. Ectomycorrhizas are in fact observed in the soils colonized by these fungi. Among these fungi, Hebeloma spp., Laccaria spp., and a few others colonize commonly in various waste sites, while Hebeloma radicosum colonizes specifically in moles' deserted middens (latrines) near their nests. The animals involved here as waste depositors or cadavers seem not to feed on the fungi and the plants but may depend on them for cleaning their own habitats, since mycorrhizas should readily remove products derived from wastes. The tripartite relationship described may be viewed as a cleaning symbiosis.

AB  - Premise of research. Plant functional groups of different stages of tropical succession are adapted to distinct environments with different availabilities of such resources as light, water, and nutrients. The sites at early-successional stages commonly have low-fertility degraded soils and are colonized by fast-growing shade-intolerant plant species, while the sites at late-successional stages usually have soils with high contents of organic matter and nutrients and are colonized by slow-growing shade-tolerant plant species. In this study, we aimed to assess the strategies adopted by plants for nutrient acquisition over tropical succession. Methodology. Grassland, shrub vegetation, and secondary and mature forests of an Atlantic rain forest ecosystem in southern Brazil were studied. Fine roots were sampled to assess length density, specific root length (SRL), diameter, tissue density, root-hair length and incidence, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization. Rhizospheric and bulk soils were sampled to assess microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN); basal respiration; total and labile C; and concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg. Pivotal results. Fine roots with longer SRL, greater incidence of root hairs, longer root hairs, and greater AMF colonization were exhibited by plants in early-successional stages in contrast with plants in late-successional ones. Nutrient depletion zones were detected in the rhizospheres of plants in early-successional stages. Fine roots from the late-successional sites exhibited greater diameter and tissue density. High values for labile C, MBC, MBN, basal respiration, and the nutrient accumulation zone occurred in the rhizospheres of plants in late-successional stages in contrast with the rhizospheres of plants in early-successional ones. Conclusions. Our results suggest that early-successional plant species invest in fine roots with morphological features for a highly efficient nutrient uptake and in AMF (scavenging strategy), whereas late-successional plant species invest in other chemoheterotrophic microorganisms in the rhizosphere (mining strategy) for nutrient acquisition. {\textcopyright} 2019 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - Growing interest in possible global climate change has underlined the need for better information concerning the way in which carbon partitioning between ecosystem components is influenced by constraints on nutrient availability. Micro-organisms play a fundamental role in the cycling of carbon and nutrients in all ecosystems but the role of fungi in particular is pivotal in boreal forest ecosystems. Traditional models of nutrient cycling are based on methods and concepts developed in agricultural systems where microorganisms are considered primarily as nutrient processors providing plants with inorganic nutrients. The filamentous nature of fungi, their ability to translocate carbon and nutrients between different substrates and the capacity of ectomycorrhizal fungi to utilise organic nutrients have all been largely ignored. In this article, a new model is suggested which emphasises competition for organic nutrients between decomposer organisms and plants, with the plants depending on their associated mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient acquisition. Antagonistic interactions involving nutrient transfer between decomposer and mycorrhizal fungi are proposed as important pathways in nutrient cycling. Due to the nutrient conservative features of decomposer fungi, inorganic nutrients are considered less important for plant nutrition. The implications of the new nutrient cycling model on the carbon balance of boreal forests are discussed.

AB  - Anthropogenic emissions have impacted terrestrial forest ecosystem processes in North America since the industrial revolution. With the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970 in the United States, atmospheric inputs of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) into forests in the Appalachian Mountains have declined, which have, potentially, mitigated their effects on processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling. Activities of microbial extracellular soil enzymes (ESEs) mediate many rate-limiting nutrient transformations in forest soils and play important roles in the decomposition of complex organic compounds. Soils in high-elevation red spruce forests are characterized by low pH and high carbon (C):N ratios and, having historically received extremely high levels of N deposition, may exhibit legacy impacts of deposition on nutrient availability and decomposition. We utilized four sites along a modeled gradient of N deposition in central Appalachia to assess contemporary ESEs in bulk soil under Acer rubrum L., Betula alleghaniensis Britt., and Picea rubens Sarg. in May, June, and July 2016. Increasing N deposition led to increases in organic fraction C and N and decreases in phosphorus (P). Sites receiving higher N also exhibited greater mineral fraction C, N, and P. ESEs were highest in organic fractions with acid phosphatases (AP) exhibiting the highest activity. There was little influence of N deposition on organic fraction ESEs, but strong evidence for a positive relationship between N deposition and activities of AP, $\beta$-glucosidases (BG), and chitinase (NAG) in mineral fractions. Species effects on ESEs were present with high AP in organic fractions under spruce and high mineral fraction fungal laccase (LAC) under birch. The sampling season demonstrated little effect on ESEs. ESEs were more strongly influenced by plot-level factors, such as tree species diversity and abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree species, than temporal or soil factors or nutrient status related to modeled cumulative N deposition across these sites. Decreases in AP, BG, and NAG activities with greater abundance of broadleaf deciduous species and increases in activities with ECM host abundance indicate that microbial communities driven by these plant functional groups are responsible for the differences in ESEs observed in these high-elevation mixed red spruce stands. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Under a warming climate, the boreal forest could become one of the largest terrestrial net CO2 sources, as increasing disturbances and soil organic matter decomposition rates (heterotrophic respiration, Rh) could offset net primary production. Since soil represents the boreal forest's largest C pool, it is critical of correctly predicting future changes in Rh, as well as its sensitivity to temperature (Q10 of Rh). We simulated a soil warming by transplanting soil cores from boreal balsam fir (Abies balsamea, BF) and black spruce (Picea mariana, BS) stands to a more southern Eastern hemlock stand (Tsuga canadensis, EH). We measured Rh and soil properties over 3 years, from June to October. Over three snow-free seasons, soil temperature (first 10 cm, including the FH organic layers) and Rh increased for BF (+3.2 °C, +60% of Rh) and BS cores (+2.3 °C, +27% of Rh). Microbial C concentration decreased by 54–73% in the FH layers of warmed and control cores relative to initial values, despite unchanged chemically labile C, probably due to excised roots and mycorrhizal hyphae. This suggests a possible underestimation of Rh during the experiment. In BF soils only, the increase in Rh was accompanied by an increase in its sensitivity to temperature. Under a +5 °C soil warming, mean predicted Rh of BF soils would increase by 83% rather than by 56%. Relative to BS soils, such increase in sensitivity could be partly due to a higher fraction of chemically labile C (+52%) in the FH layers and a higher mean warming effect. It suggests that for BF forest soils, predicting decomposition rates for a warmer climate based on current temperature sensitivities could be inadequate. However, longer-term studies are needed to see if this increase in Q10 of Rh for BF soils would be maintained for longer periods. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Little is known of how hurricane-induced deposition of canopy material onto tropical forest floors influences the soil microbial communities involved in decomposition of these materials. In this study, to identify how soil bacterial and fungal communities might change after a hurricane, and their possible roles in the C and N cycles, soils were collected from five 2000 m2 permanent plots in Lowland, Upland and Riparian primary forests in Costa Rica 3 months before and 7 months after Hurricane Otto damaged the forests. The soil Water, inorganic N and Biomass C increased and total organic C decreased Post-Hurricane, all of which best predicted the changes in the Post-Hurricane soil microbial communities. Post-Hurricane soils from all forest types showed significant changes in community composition of total bacteria, total fungi, and five functional groups of microbes (i.e., degrading/lignin degrading, NH4+-producing, and ammonium oxidizing bacteria, and the complex C degrading/wood rot/ lignin degrading and ectomycorrhizal fungi), along with a decrease in richness in genera of all groups. As well, the mean proportion of DNA sequences (MPS) of all five functional groups increased. There were also significant changes in the MPS values of 7 different fungal and 7 different bacterial genera that were part of these functional groups. This is the first evidence that hurricane-induced deposition of canopy material is stimulating changes in the soil microbial communities after the hurricane, involving changes in specific taxonomic and functional group genera, and reduction in the community richness while selecting for dominant genera possibly better suited to process the canopy material. These changes may represent examples of taxonomic switching of functionally redundant microbial genera in response to dramatic changes in resource input. It is possible that differences in these microbial communities and genera may serve as indicators of disturbed and recovering regional soil ecosystems, and should be evaluated in the future. {\textcopyright} 2020 Eaton et al.

AB  - Fungi are one of the most important soil microorganisms due to their abundance and the importance of the ecosystem processes they carry out, like decomposition, nutrient cycling, and the establishment of biological interactions such as mycorrhizas. Fungi can be used as bioindicators because they are highly sensitive to alterations in their surroundings, thus being useful for monitoring ecological changes and effects of human activity on natural ecosystems. Nothofagus alpina (raul{\'{i}}) is an ecologically and economically important species of South American temperate forests. It is currently included in domestication and conservation programs, and provenance trials have been installed in different ecosystems of Patagonia. These trials are ideal for studying how tree genetics might influence the associated microbiota. Afforestation with fast-growing exotic conifers (mainly Pinus ponderosa) had been promoted as an important economic activity in Patagonia, but nowadays there is an increasing interest for the establishment of mix Pinus + Nothofagus plantations instead of monospecific Pinus stands and for using Pinus plantations as refugee for assisted Nothofagus migration. The main objective of this work was to explore the structure of different fungal communities in the rhizosphere of N. alpina with different genetic diversity (high, intermediate, and low) implanted under a native Nothofagus forest and a P. ponderosa plantation. Fingerprinting based on Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis revealed differences in the structure of the rhizosphere fungal communities. Some relationships between N. alpina genetic diversity and composition of rhizosphere fungal communities were observed. In the native forest, one of the provenances (intermediate genetic diversity) was associated with the highest richness of Basidiomycetes and total fungi. In addition, individual genetic parameters of N. alpina specimens implanted in the native forest significantly correlated with Ascomycetes richness. It was also found that Basidiomycetes were the dominating fungal taxa in the native forest, and Ascomycetes in the P. ponderosa plantation. Factors as soil physicochemical characteristics and the dominant forestry species, which provide different quantity and quality of litter inputs and are associated with different ectomycorrhizal fungi, seemed to be the main factors determining this significant difference between the native forest and the plantation. Beyond highlighting the potential of applying soil fungi as bioindicators, our study contributes to understanding the relationship between host genetics and rhizosphere fungi. This information is relevant not only for conservation and restoration programs, but also for taking management decisions related with sustainable forestry and domestication of native tree species. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We examined how chronic nitrogen (N) enrichment of pine and hardwood forest stands has affected the relative abundance, functional capacity, and activity of soil bacteria and fungi. During Fall 2002 we collected one soil core (5.6 cm diameter; organic horizon plus 10 cm of mineral soil) from each of four 5 m×5 m subplots within the control, low N (5 g N m-2 per year), and high N (15 g N m-2 per year) plots in both the hardwood and pine stands at the Chronic Nitrogen Amendment Study at Harvard Forest. The samples were analyzed for total and active bacterial and fungal biomass, microbial catabolic response profiles, the activities of cellulolytic and ligninolytic enzymes, and total, labile and microbially derived organic carbon (C). Live, fine roots were also collected from the control and low N pine plots and analyzed for ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition and diversity. Active fungal biomass was 27-61% and 42-69% lower in the fertilized compared to control plots in the hardwood and pine stands, respectively. Active bacterial biomass was not greatly affected by N additions, resulting in significantly lower fungal:bacterial biomass ratios in the N-treated plots. This shift in microbial community composition was accompanied by a significant reduction in the activity of phenol oxidase, a lignin-degrading enzyme produced by white-rot fungi. In the pine stand, ectomycorrhizal fungal community diversity was lower in the low N-treated plot than in the control plot. Differences in ectomycorrhizal community structure were also detected between control and fertilized pine plots, including a reduction in those species with the highest relative frequencies in the control community. Finally, N enrichment altered the pattern of microbial substrate use, with the relative response to the addition of carboxylic acids and carbohydrates being significantly lower in the N-treated plots, even after the data were normalized to account for differences in microbial biomass. These patterns are consistent with lower decomposition rates and altered N cycling observed previously at this site. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. About 10 years after establishment, plantations of Western Redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don) on northern Vancouver Island, British Columbia become nutrient deficient and chlorotic, grow slowly, and are susceptible to invasion by the ericaceous shrub Salal (Gaultheria shallon Pursh.). 2. To test the hypothesis that $\delta$15N can be related to site histories (site disturbance, soil N dynamics and plant development), we measured soil and foliar $\delta$15N in the summer of 1992 in 3-year-old (nutrient-sufficient) and 10-year-old (nutrient-deficient) plantations and in old-growth stands. The foliar and soil $\delta$15N values of the plantations and old-growth forests were different and closely reflected site histories. Salal invasion and nutrient deficiency interacted to depress the growth of Redcedar in 10-year-old plantations. 3. Site preparation destroyed the top soil organic layers (fresh and decaying litter) and forced Salal (ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal) into the humus layer, where it was in direct competition with Redcedar, thereby disadvantaging arbuscular mycorrhizal/ non-mycorrhizal Redcedar in its nutrient acquisition during a period when N and P are severely limited. 4. There was a large seasonal range of foliar $\delta$15N (5{\textperiodcentered}5 and 4{\textperiodcentered}3‰ for 10-year-old Redcedar and Salal, respectively), and there was no relationship between foliar $\delta$15N and measured rooting depth, demonstrating that rooting depths cannot be used to explain foliar $\delta$15N variation among coexisting woody taxa. 5. Foliar and soil $\delta$15N declined with site age and with a presumed change from 'open' to 'closed' N cycling; the 15N-depleting effects of mycorrhizal N transformations contributed to the observed $\delta$15N decline.

AB  - We studied soil organic carbon (C) chemistry at the mountain birch forest-tundra ecotone in three regions of the Fennoscandian mountain range with comparable vegetation cover but contrasting degrees of continentality and latitude. The aim of the study was to identify functional compound classes and their relationships to decomposition and spatial variation across the ecotone and latitudinal gradient. Solid-state (13) C nuclear magnetic resonance (CPMAS (13) C NMR) was used to identify seven functional groups of soil organic C: alkyls , N-alkyls , O-alkyls , acetals , aromatics , phenolics and carboxyls . N-alkyls , O-alkyls and acetals are generally considered labile substrates for a large number of saprotrophic fungi and bacteria, whilst phenolics and aromatics are mainly decomposed by lignolytic organisms and contribute to the formation of soil organic matter together with aliphatic alkyls and carboxyls . All soils contained a similar proportional distribution of functional groups, although relatively high amounts of N-alkyls , O-alkyls and acetals were present in comparison to earlier published studies, suggesting that large amounts of soil C were potentially vulnerable to microbial degradation. Soil organic matter composition was different at the most southerly site (Dovrefjell, Norway), compared with the two more northerly sites (Abisko, Sweden, and Joatka, Norway), with higher concentrations of aromatics and phenolics , as well as pronounced differences in alkyl concentrations between forest and tundra soils. Clear differences between mountain birch forest and tundra heath soil was noted, with generally higher concentrations of labile carbon present in tundra soils. We conclude that, although mesic soils around the forest-tundra ecotone in Fennoscandia are a potential source of C to the atmosphere in a changing environment, the response is likely to vary between comparable ecosystems in relation to latitude and continentality as well as soil properties especially soil nitrogen content and pH.

AB  - In the course of the interdisciplinary research program `'Studies of ecosystems in the Limestone Alps- Achenkirch Altitude profiles'', the basidiomycetes of different forest types were studied extensively for three years. The goal of the now presented investigation was to gather basic data regarding the actual state of mycocoenosis (qualitative and quantitative) in this area. The number of species, their abundance as well as their productivity, were recorded over the period of July 1991 to November 1993 in 6 plots situated in the area of Achenkirch (Tyrol, Austria): a subalpine spruce forest, a subalpine mixed forest, two beech woods, a Pinus stand and a ski slope. Altogether 466 basidiomycetes species were recorded, and classified in the following three main ecological groups: symbiontic mycorrhizal species, parasites and decomposers of soil, litter and wood. Special attention was taken also to the occurrence of Aphyllophorales which often are neglected in comparable studies. 133 corticoid, poroid, hydnoid and clavaroid basidiomycetes belonging to the Aphyllophorales were identified. Differences between the mycobiota of the three forest types are evident in regard of species diversity, productivity and abundance. The highest species diversity and abundance was found in the subalpine spruce forest with more than 300 fungal taxa In the beech forests more than 200 basidiomycetes species were recorded, whereas only low species diversity was found in the Pinus stand (37 species) and on the slope (29 species). Dominant and characteristic species for each forest type are proposed and compared.

AB  - The present study investigated the relative importance of leaf and root carbon input for soil invertebrates. Experimental plots were established at the Swiss Canopy Crane (SCC) site where the forest canopy was enriched with 13C depleted CO2 at a target CO2 concentration of c. 540 p.p.m. We exchanged litter between labelled and unlabelled areas resulting in four treatments: (i) leaf litter and roots labelled, (ii) only leaf litter labelled, (iii) only roots labelled and (iv) unlabelled controls. In plots with only 13C-labelled roots most of the soil invertebrates studied were significantly depleted in 13C, e.g. earthworms, chilopods, gastropods, diplurans, collembolans, mites and isopods, indicating that these taxa predominantly obtain their carbon from belowground input. In plots with only 13C-labelled leaf litter only three taxa, including, e.g. juvenile Glomeris spp. (Diplopoda), were significantly depleted in 13C suggesting that the majority of soil invertebrates obtain its carbon from roots. This is in stark contrast to the view that decomposer food webs are based on litter input from aboveground. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.

AB  - Leaf litter chemistry and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are key drivers of the below-ground nitrogen (N) cycling within forest ecosystems. Their combined effects on litter decomposition and N competition between microbial decomposers and plants are still uncertain. We conducted a glasshouse microcosm experiment with low or high ECM-colonized beech (Fagus sylvatica) saplings, growing with litter collected from old or young beech trees growing on the same loamy soil. After 6 months of growth, we investigated litter decomposition rates, microbial respiration and the N pools within leaf litter, soil (different pools), microbial and plant shoot biomass. We found that the mass loss of the litter from young trees was always higher than the litter from the mature trees. The microbial biomass N per unit soil carbon was low when the litter, especially from mature trees, was added, suggesting that the litter provided recalcitrant compounds and limited soil microbial activity. In contrast to the ‘Gadgil effect' hypothesis, the high ECM-colonized roots increased the litter decomposition rate and N immobilization in poorly decomposable litter in comparison with the litter incubated with the low ECM-colonized roots. Finally, the high ECM-colonized plants that received the poorly decomposable leaf litter exhibited the highest shoot N amount and biomass and were associated with the lowest microbial biomass N. Two-way anovas revealed that litter and ECM fungi occurrence together impacted final particulate organic N, microbial biomass N, the amount of shoot N and shoot biomass. Four N pools are key drivers of microbial biomass N and shoot N: particulate organic N, total N, soil ammonium concentration and litter N concentration. Synthesis. Our results support the hypothesis that poorly decomposable leaf litter produced by mature beech trees and ECM fungi together decrease microbial N immobilization but increase tree N acquisition. Increasing N retention within the recalcitrant N forms in soil was identified as a key mechanism by which beech alters soil N cycling with potential positive feedbacks on its acquisition by the plant. Our result emphasizes the importance of considering within-species litter-trait variability in litter decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

AB  - In the southern Appalachian mountains a subcanopy species, Rhododendron maximum, inhibits the establishment and survival of canopy tree seedlings. One of the mechanisms by which seedlings could be inhibited is an allelopathic effect of decomposing litter or leachate from the canopy of R. maximum (R.m.) on seed germination, root elongation, or mycorrhizal colonization. The potential for allelopathy by R.m. was tested with two bioassay species (lettuce and cress), with seeds from four native tree species, and with three ectomycorrhizal fungi. Inhibitory influences of throughfall, fresh litter, and decomposed litter (organic layer) from forest with R.m. (+R.m. sites) were compared to similar extractions made from forest without R.m. (-R.m. sites). Throughfall and leachates of the organic layer from both +R.m. and -R.m. sites stimulated germination of the bioassay species above that of the distilled water control, to a similar extent. There was an inhibitory effect of leachates of litter from +R.m. sites on seed germination and root elongation rate of both bioassay species compared with that of litter from -R.m. sites. Native tree seed stratified in forest floor material from both forest types had a slightly higher seed germination rate compared with the control. A 2-yr study of seed germination and seedling mortality of two tree species, Quercus rubra and Prunus serotina, in field plots showed no significant influence of litter or organic layer from either forest type. Incorporating R.m. leaf material into the growth medium in vitro depressed growth of one ectomycorrhizal species but did not affect two other species. Leaf material from other deciduous tree species depressed ectomycorrhizal growth to a similar or greater extent as leaf material from R.m. In conclusion, R.m. litter can have an allelopathic effect on seed germination and root elongation of bioassay species as well as some ectomycorrhizal species. However, this allelopathic affect is not manifest in field sites and is not likely to be an important cause for the inhibition of seedling survival within thickets of R.m.

AB  - Premise of research. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can colonize plants of different species, creating a common mycorrhizal network (CMN) connecting the roots of many plants. How the CMN affects plant performance, especially during early plant life stages, is still uncertain. We examined the seedling performance of two temperate forest wildflowers (Arisaema triphyllum and Maianthemum racemosum) with and without open access to a CMN produced by conspecific or heterospecific adult plants, under conditions of optimal watering and water stress. Methodology. We established a split-pot design, where the adult Arisaema or Maianthemum plants grew in the main portion of the pot and the seedlings of both species grew in the seedling pots within the main container but separated from the soil matrix by nylon membranes that permitted or prevented connection with the mycorrhizal network of the adult plants. We examined the seedling growth response, nutrient acquisition, and gas exchange after 3 yr of growth. Pivotal results. Connection with the CMN had little effect on seedling biomass but did result in higher seedling nutrient content. Adult plant identity affected the nutrient content for the Maianthemum seedlings. Adult plant identity did not directly affect the Arisaema seedlings, but connection with the CMN of a heterospecific adult improved leaf N content more than connection with the CMN of a conspecific adult. Water stress also impacted the seedlings differently-water-stressed Arisaema seedlings had less seedling biomass, while water-stressed Maianthemum seedlings, for example, had higher nutrient content compared with well-watered plants. The Maianthemum seedlings also exhibited the highest gas exchange rates when grown under water stress with a heterospecific adult, regardless of their connection with the CMN. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the CMN may confer both positive and negative effects on seedling performance, but the direction and magnitude of the effects will vary between plant species and can be altered under environmental stress. {\textcopyright} 2018 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - Understanding how extraradical mycorrhizal fungal hyphae (EMH) regulate the cycling and retention of plant-assimilated carbon (C) in forest soils requires estimation of the production, mortality, and decomposition of EMH. To do this, the use of mass-balance models in combination with hyphal in-growth mesh bags (“in-growth bags”) was proposed in recent studies. However, poor knowledge on the decomposition of field-grown EMH prevents confirmation of assumed EMH decomposition dynamics. In this study, we determined the decrease in hyphal length density of field-grown EMH of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) over eight months in in-growth bags incubated in a warm-temperate Chamaecyparis obtusa forest, to study EMH decomposition under field conditions. We used exponential decay models to describe the changes in the decomposition rate of EMH over the incubation time, between EMH diameter classes, and between seasons. A rapid decrease of the decomposition rate of EMH within two months from 2.5 to 0.1 month−1 was estimated, corresponding to an increase in half-life from 0.3 to 7 months. Furthermore, significant differences in the initial maximum decomposition rate were estimated between fine (1.6 month−1; minimum half-life: 0.4 months) and coarse EMH (3.1 month−1; minimum half-life: 0.2 months) and between incubations during spring-summer (April and August; 2.7 month−1; minimum half-life: 0.3 months) and autumn-winter (October and February; 1.1 month−1; minimum half-life: 0.6 months). This large variability in the decomposition rates of EMH of AM fungi has to be considered in mass-balance models to estimate C fluxes between plants, soil, and the atmosphere. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Our recent studies have demonstrated that forest litter used in a bare-root forest nursery promoted survival and growth of two-year-old Scots pine seedlings and positively shaped the development of their ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities. To determine whether the beneficial effects of litter treatment can be extended to the next growing seasons, litter-treated seedlings were outplanted to four sites with different environmental conditions: forest clear-cut (S1), area formerly polluted by emissions from nitrogen fertilizer plant (S2), abandoned agricultural land (S3,) and coastal sand dunes (S4). Seedlings grown in mineral nursery soil without litter amendment served as controls. Height and survival of seedlings were measured over three consecutive years after outplanting. At the end of the third growing season, the mycorrhizal status of seedlings was assessed using DNA-based identification techniques. Litter treatment during the nursery phase significantly improved the height of seedlings at the end of the first growing season at all tested sites. In the second and third growing seasons after outplanting, the heights of litter treated seedlings remained greater compared to control seedlings at three of the four sites; however, at the abandoned agricultural site (S3), significantly lower growth of litter-treated seedlings was observed. After the third growing season, the differences in seedling heights at the forest clear-cut (S1) and the site formerly polluted by nitrogen (S2) were not statistically significant. Survival of all outplanted seedlings varied by season and study site, but litter treated seedlings showed a clear tendency towards enhanced survival. Three years after outplanting, the survival rates of litter-treated seedlings ranged from approximately 81\% at S4 to 96\% at S2; for control seedlings, survival rates ranged from 63\% at S4 to 81\% at S3. At sites S1, S2 and S4, the survival of litter-treated seedling was significantly higher. There was a substantial transformation in ECM community composition with low persistence of suilloid mycorrhizas for both litter-treated and control seedlings three years after outplanting. Two-way analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) indicated that differences in ECM fungal community composition across seedlings from different sites likely were due to site specificity rather than previous litter treatment. Our results indicated that nursery soil amended with pine forest litter creates favourable conditions for the production of pine seedlings with better root quality and high abundance of suilloid mycorrhizas, thus allowing for potential reductions in mortality after outplanting on unfavourable sites.

AB  - Mining disturbs large forested areas around the world, including boreal forests after oil sands mining in Canada. Industrial companies are expected to reclaim degraded land to ecosystems with equivalent land capability. This research showed the value of woody debris for reclamation of dramatically disturbed landscapes with a forest ecosystem end land use. Adding woody debris during reclamation can facilitate recovery of flora, soil nutrient cycling and water and nutrient holding capacity. Combined with forest floor material, woody debris can provide native plant propagules that would be otherwise commercially unavailable. Sites with and without woody debris on forest floor material containing identifiable litter (L), fragmented and fermented litter (F), and humus (H) (LFH), and peat mineral soil mix (peat) cover soils were studied. Within 2 years, woody debris decreased bare ground and created microsites which were positively associated with greater vegetation cover and woody plant density. Woody debris treatments had lower soil available nitrate and soil under woody debris had a lower temperature range and higher soil volumetric water content than control treatments without woody debris. Woody debris did not affect first year microbial biomass carbon or mycorrhizae, but both were greater on LFH than peat cover soil. LFH was associated with lower bare ground and greater vegetation cover, species richness, and soil phosphorus and potassium than peat cover soil, which had greater soil sulfate. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Our understanding of how saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi interact to re-circulate carbon and nutrients from plant litter and soil organic matter is limited by poor understanding of their spatiotemporal dynamics. In order to investigate how different functional groups of fungi contribute to carbon and nitrogen cycling at different stages of decomposition, we studied changes in fungal community composition along vertical profiles through a Pinus sylvestris forest soil. We combined molecular identification methods with C-14 dating of the organic matter, analyses of carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios and N-15 natural abundance measurements. Saprotrophic fungi were primarily confined to relatively recently (< 4 yr) shed litter components on the surface of the forest floor, where organic carbon was mineralized while nitrogen was retained. Mycorrhizal fungi dominated in the underlying, more decomposed litter and humus, where they apparently mobilized N and made it available to their host plants. Our observations show that the degrading and nutrient-mobilizing components of the fungal community are spatially separated. This has important implications for biogeochemical studies of boreal forest ecosystems.

AB  - Many fungi capable of forming sheathing (ecto-) mycorrhizas are associated with trees. But what are the rules governing their occurrence? Evidence from first generation woodlands/forests, where trees grow on sites that have been treeless for many years, indicates that species of fungi occurring at early stages of woodland development ('early-stage fungi') are, in due course, superseded by others ('late-stage fungi'). There is an ordered succession which seems to reflect, in large measure, the different abilities of early- and late-stage fungi to form mycorrhizas on roots growing in soils with accumulations of recalcitrant leaf litter. In second generation woodlands/forests there seems to be little evidence of early-stage fungi. This is not so surprising as it may seem, bearing in mind that their soils are already likely to have accumulations of recalcitrant litter. Instead of classifying sheathing mycorrhizal fungi by referring to the temporal stage of woodland development, it now seems more meaningful to judge them by their abilities to colonize roots in soils with or without accumulations of different types of litter. {\textcopyright} 1987.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to indicate the most effective method of revitalizing degraded forest area. The different modifications of wood chips were used as a substitute for humus layer. The mites (Acari), and moss mites (Oribatida) as the bio-indicators of soil succession changes were used. The study began 2 years after planting of Scots pine seedlings on the land devastated by military activity, at the former military training ground (GPS: 53.156943N, 17.986440E). The soil on this area was in the type of rusty soils and subtype of the rusty algae soils. Scots pine seedlings were planted in spring 2011, in a distance 1.5×0.8 m. In one-factor experiment four soil mulching treatments were tested: 1. uncovered soil – control (C), 2. soil mulched with wood chips (W), 3. W + mycorrhizal preparation (WM), 4. W + forest litter (WL). Three replicates of microplots arrangement was applied. Each microplot was 5 m long with 3 rows of Scots pine. Each replication covers 10 rows. Mulching with wood chips was carried out on April 12, 2012. On October 25, 2012, the wood chips on the WM microplots were inoculated with the mycorrhizal biopreparation, and on the WL microplots, a 10% addition of fresh forest litter from the ripe fresh coniferous forest was applied. After the end of the growing season of 2012, 2013 and 2014, the measurement of the plants was carried out (the height, the root neck diameter, the length of one-year increments in the last whorl, the number of one-year increments of the last whorl and the lengths of one-year increments of the last whorl). The samples for acarological tests were collected four times. In total, 40 substrate samples with a volume of 50 cm3 each were collected from each treatment. Mites extraction was carried out for 7 days in Tullgren apparatus. Mites were identified to the order, and moss mites to the species or genus, including juvenile stages. Calculated: the average density of mites, the dominance index, the species richness, the diversity of moss mites, the average number of species, and the Shannon general species diversity index. The use of soil mulching with the Scots pine wood chips did not significantly affect the growth and developmental characteristics of the Scots pine plants. After mulching with wood chips, the total number of mites increased many times, and moss mites began to dominate among micro-arthropods. Mulching treatments increased the number and the species diversity of moss mites in the substrate. The number of moss mites increased the most in wood chips without additives. The highest species diversity was observed in the wood chips with the addition of forest litter. Among moss mites Tectocepheus velatus visibly dominated in all study treatments. Oppiella nova and Scutovertex sculptus also constituted numerous mites populations. The study shows that the wood chips are very useful for use in the regeneration of the devastated and degraded forest soils. {\textcopyright} Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of The Environment Protection.

AB  - Fertilization experiments in tropical forests have shown that litterfall increases in response to the addition of one or more soil nutrients. However, the relationship between soil nutrient availability and litterfall is poorly defined along natural soil fertility gradients, especially in tropical montane forests. Here, we measured litterfall for two years in five lower montane 1-ha plots spanning a soil fertility and precipitation gradient in lower montane forest at Fortuna, Panama. Litterfall was also measured in a concurrent nitrogen fertilization experiment at one site. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to test for site (or treatment), year, and season effects on vegetative, reproductive and total litterfall. We predicted that total litterfall, and the ratio of reproductive to leaf litterfall, would increase with nutrient availability along the fertility gradient, and in response to nitrogen addition. We found that total annual litterfall varied substantially among 1-ha plots (4.78Mg/ha/yr to 7.96Mg/ha/yr), and all but the most aseasonal plot showed significant seasonality in litterfall. However, litterfall accumulation did not track soil nutrient availability; instead forest growing on relatively infertile soil, but dominated by an ectomycorrhizal tree species, had the highest total litterfall accumulation. In the fertilization plots, significantly more total litter fell in nitrogen addition relative to control plots, but this increase in response to nitrogen (13\%) was small compared to variation observed among 1-ha plots. These results suggest that while litterfall at Fortuna is nutrient-limited, compositional and functional turnover along the fertility gradient obscure any direct relationship between soil resource availability and canopy productivity. Resumen Se demostro con experimentos de fertilizacion en bosques tropicales incrementos en la caida de hojarasca asociados con la adicion de nutrientes; empero, se desconoce la relacion entre la disponibilidad de nutrientes del suelo con la produccion de hojarasca en gradientes naturales de fertilidad del suelo, especialmente en bosques montanos tropicales. Medimos la produccion de hojarasca durante dos anos en cinco parcelas (1-ha) en bosques montanos bajos, sobre gradientes de fertilidad y precipitacion y en un experimento paralelo de fertilizacion de nitrogeno en la Reserva Forestal Fortuna, Panama. Predijimos incrementos de hojarasca total y reproductiva con la disponibilidad de nutrientes en el gradiente de fertilidad del suelo y en respuesta a la adicion de nitrogeno (13\%). Encontramos que la hojarasca total varia sustancialmente entre parcelas (4.78 Mg/ha/yr hasta 7.96 Mg/ha/yr) y que en todas las parcelas, excepto la menos estacional, hay estacionalidad significativa en la cantidad de hojarasca; pero, la acumulacion de hojarasca no coincide con la disponibilidad de nutrientes en el suelo, porque el bosque sobre suelo poco fertil con dominio de una especie ectomicorricica, presento mayor acumulacion de hojarasca. Las parcelas con fertilizacion tenian significativamente mas hojarasca que las control; pero, el incremento en hojarasca en respuesta a la adicion de nitrogeno fue menor respecto a la variacion entre parcelas. Los resultados sugieren que mientras la produccion de hojarasca en Fortuna es limitada por nutrientes, la variacion en la composicion de especies a traves de gradientes de fertilidad ocultan cualquier relacion directa entre la disponibilidad de nutrientes del suelo y la productividad del dosel.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) limits plant growth in many forest ecosystems. The largest N pool in the plant soil system is typically organic, contained primarily within the living plants and in the humus and litter layers of the soil. Understanding the pathways by which plants obtain N is a priority for clarifying N cycling processes in forest ecosystems. In this review, the interactions between saprotrophic microorganisms and ectomycorrhizal fungi in N nutrition with a focus on the ability of ectomycorrhizal fungi to circumvent N mineralization for the nutrition of plants in forest ecosystems will be discussed. Traditionally, it is believed that in order for plants to fulfill their N requirements, they primarily utilize ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). In temperate forest ecosystems, many woody plants form ectomycorrhizas which significantly improves phosphorus (P) and N acquisition by plants. Under laboratory conditions, ectomycorrhizal fungi have also been proven to be able to obtain N from organic sources such as protein. It was thus proposed that ectomycorrhizal fungi potentially circumvent the standard N cycle involving N mineralization by saprotrophic microorganisms. However, in many forest ecosystems the majority of the proteins in the forest floor form complexes with polyphenols. Direct access of N by ectomycorrhizal fungi from a polyphenol protein complex may be limited. Ectomycorrhizal fungi may depend on saprotrophic microorganisms to liberate organic N sources from polyphenol complexes. Thus, interactions between saprotrophic microorganisms and ectomycorrhizal fungi are likely to be essential in the cycling of N within temperate forest ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Trends and limitations of SO2 pollution research are outlined: information on the effects of dry deposition and the less toxic solubility products is essential, but little emphasis has been given to these. Field studies involving microbial communities exposed to different concentrations of SO2 are reported, as are laboratory studies on effects on fungal growth and activity on agar and leaf litter. -P.J.Jarvis

AB  - Information on pathways and rates of decomposition of coarse woody debris (CWD) from one of the dominant boreal tree species – Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) – is scarce. We examined presence and distribution of internal decay in its living trees and decomposition rates in an 88-year chronosequence of logs in an old-growth mesic mixed European boreal forest. Fifty-two percent of the trees started decaying prior to death. Butt or stem rot was caused by white- and brown-rot biotrophic fungi in almost equal proportions. Those trees lost on average 29% of their initial wood mass. The mean decomposition rate of wood as related to initial conditions was 0.007 yr −1 for wood with initial biotrophic decay and 0.010 yr −1 for wood with saprotrophic decay. Bark lost its mass and volume faster – at a rate of 0.056 yr −1 . The rate of carbon (C) loss for the whole stem was 0.024 yr −1 in wood affected by saprotrophic fungi and 0.007 yr −1 when the tree was affected by biotrophic fungi. When calculating C losses due to decomposition, separating bark and wood with different C concentrations and decomposition patterns as well as the rate of biotrophic and saprotrophic decay enables us to refine estimates of the role of Siberian larch CWD in C cycling. Further research is still needed to resolve uncertainties around the role of fungal communities and the origins and decomposition rates of butt rots and stem rots in living trees of Siberian larch, as well as the distribution patterns of these fungi and decomposition processes in individual trees and at the ecosystem level. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We explored the most influential stand-scaled drivers of ectomycorrhizal, terricolous saprotrophic, and wood-inhabiting (main functional groups) macrofungal species richness in mixed forests by applying regression models. We tested 67 potential explanatory variables representing tree species composition, stand structure, soil and litter conditions, microclimate, landscape structure, and management history. Within the main functional groups, we formed and modeled guilds and used their drivers to more objectively interpret the drivers of the main functional groups. Terricolous saprotrophic fungi were supported by air humidity and litter mass. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were suppressed by high soil nitrogen content and high air temperature. Wood saprotrophs were enhanced by litter pH (deciduous habitats), deadwood cover, and beech proportion. Wood saprotrophic guilds were determined often by drivers with hidden effects on all wood saprotrophs: non-parasites: total deadwood cover; parasites: beech proportion; white rotters: litter pH; brown rotters: air temperature (negatively); endophytes: beech proportion; early ruderals: deciduous stands that were formerly meadows; combative invaders: deciduous tree taxa; heart rotters: coarse woody debris; late stage specialists: deciduous deadwood. Terricolous saprotrophic cord formers positively responded to litter mass. Studying the drivers of guilds simultaneously, beech was a keystone species to maintain fungal diversity in the region, and coniferous stands would be more diverse by introducing deciduous tree species. Guilds were determined by drivers different from each other underlining their different functional roles and segregated substrate preferences. Modeling guilds of fungal species with concordant response to the environment would be powerful to explore and understand the functioning of fungal communities. {\textcopyright} 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Chhattisgarh is an important state covering largest semi-evergreen Sal (Shorea robusta) forest area in the country, where the Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (ABR) harbours a rich mushroom wealth in association with the varieties of tree species. Mushrooms, an important component of the forest ecosystem, grow on a variety of habitats open or shady grounds. Some grow under certain kinds of plant litter, and some of these grow only with one kind of tree species showing their host specificity. The mushroom species like Amanita, Boletus, Cantharellus, Russula and Lactarius are usually associated with certain types of trees. There are number of ectomycorrhizal mushrooms (EM) many of which have narrow host range, facing greater threat due to transformation of forests land. The mushrooms such as Agaricus, Amanita, Cantharellus, Calocybe, Geastrum, Ganoderma, Lentinus, Pleurotus, Russula, Termitomyces, Volvariella, Scleroderma appear widely in different forests; however, local people lack knowledge of in situ conservation of these species, thus could not maintain their regular accessibility. Therefore, distribution, biology, taxonomy, chemistry, cultivation and conservation of mushroom have great significance and relevance, particularly among the tribal groups many of which prefers to live in the forests. {\textcopyright} Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

AB  - We compared the understory herb and shrub communities of pre-commercially thinned and unthinned young- and old-growth Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands. Sites were located in the Cascade Mountains of western Oregon. Young stands were approximately 40 years old at the time of sampling; thinning occurred 20 years earlier. Although tree spacing was wider in thinned than in unthinned stands, faster tree growth in thinned stands meant that thinning had no long-term effect on basal area of P. menziesii. The very large, widely spaced P. menziesii individuals in old-growth stands contributed similar basal area as the smaller trees in young stands; however, old stands had much higher basal area of shade-tolerant conifers. Although low shrubs responded positively to thinning, the difference in cover between thinned and unthinned stands was too small to be statistically significant. Ordination of sample plots in terms of their understory shrub and herb species composition identified a strong gradient in community composition from young to old-growth stands. Understory species associated with old growth included both gap specialists and those that may be dependent on the litter depth and mycorrhizal fungi of old-growth forest floors. Although both thinned and unthinned young stand composition were quite distinct from that of old-growth stands, thinned stands were more similar to old growth than were unthinned stands. Thinned stands had higher frequency of late-seral herbs than did unthinned stands. Forest generalist and release species showed mixed responses to thinning. We conclude that pre-commercial thinning may be a useful management tool to encourage old growth associated understory herbs without precipitating dominance of the understory by low shrubs and weedy species. Although thinning did accelerate tree growth, changes in the understory appear to have been precipitated by the transient increase in resource levels following thinning rather than by any long-term changes in stand structure. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is unclear how free-living saprotrophs (bacteria and fungi, SAP) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi responses to N addition impact soil C dynamics. Our aim was to investigate how SAP and EM communities are impacted by N enrichment and to estimate whether these changes influence decay of litter and humus. We conducted a long-term experiment in northern Sweden, maintained since 2004, consisting of ambient, low N additions (0, 3, 6, and 12 kg N ha−1 year−1) simulating current N deposition rates in the boreal region, as well as a high N addition (50 kg N ha−1 year−1). Our data showed that long-term N enrichment impeded mass loss of litter, but not of humus, and only in response to the highest N addition treatment. Furthermore, our data showed that EM fungi reduced the mass of N and P in both substrates during the incubation period compared to when only SAP organisms were present. Low N additions had no effect on microbial community structure, while the high N addition decreased fungal and bacterial biomasses and altered EM fungi and SAP community composition. Actinomycetes were the only bacterial SAP to show increased biomass in response to the highest N addition. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of how anthropogenic N enrichment can influence soil C accumulation rates and suggest that current N deposition rates in the boreal region (≤12 kg N ha−1 year−1) are likely to have a minor impact on the soil microbial community and the decomposition of humus and litter. {\textcopyright} 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Fungi regulate key nutrient cycling processes in many forest ecosystems, but their diversity and distribution within and across ecosystems are poorly understood. Here, we examine the spatial distribution of fungi across a boreal and tropical ecosystem, focusing on ectomycorrhizal fungi. We analyzed fungal community composition across litter (organic horizons) and underlying soil horizons (0-20 cm) using 454 pyrosequencing and clone library sequencing. In both forests, we found significant clustering of fungal communities by site and soil horizons with analogous patterns detected by both sequencing technologies. Free-living saprotrophic fungi dominated the recently-shed leaf litter and ectomycorrhizal fungi dominated the underlying soil horizons. This vertical pattern of fungal segregation has also been found in temperate and European boreal forests, suggesting that these results apply broadly to ectomycorrhizal-dominated systems, including tropical rain forests. Since ectomycorrhizal and free-living saprotrophic fungi have different influences on soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics, information on the spatial distribution of these functional groups will improve our understanding of forest nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2013 McGuire et al.

AB  - Land management practices considerably influence ecosystem processes and functioning, particularly in dryland ecosystems where nutrient and water limitations have direct (via effects on productivity) and indirect (via effects on soil biota) effects on ecosystem properties. Fungi in soils and associated with roots play critical roles in soil nutrient cycling and plant nutrient acquisition, but their responses to land management practices in dryland ecosystems remain equivocal. Here we evaluate the responses of fungal communities in roots and soils associated with a Eucalyptus saligna plantation after six years of forest management practices (irrigation and fertilisation) and in two different microenvironments within treated plots, in the presence and absence of understorey grasses. We observed that the richness and evenness of fungal communities were higher in soil than in root samples, but these two parameters did not vary among any of the management treatments. Effects of fertilisation and irrigation on fungal community composition were observed and appeared to be related to variation in soil pH, moisture, and nitrogen availability. Both fertilisation and irrigation decreased the ratios of ectomycorrhizal fungi to total fungi and increased the frequencies of saprotrophic and/or plant pathogenic fungi. We observed that some OTUs were shared between soil and root-associated fungal communities but that fertilisation was associated with lower frequencies of shared OTUs, suggesting a decoupling of these communities. In the absence of grasses, where only tree roots were present, we observed fewer tight relationships between fungal occurrence in root and soil samples. Our findings highlight the importance of forest management practices for fungal community assembly processes in dryland ecosystems, which may have consequences for the predictability of fungal community dynamics and nutrient cycling.

AB  - Evergreen and deciduous plants are widely expected to have different impacts on soil nitrogen (N) availability because of differences in leaf litter chemistry and ensuing effects on net N mineralization ( min). We evaluated this hypothesis by compiling published data on net min rates beneath co-occurring stands of evergreen and deciduous trees. The compiled data included 35 sets of co-occurring stands in temperate and boreal forests. Evergreen and deciduous stands did not have consistently divergent effects on net min rates; net min beneath deciduous trees was higher when comparing natural stands (19 contrasts), but equivalent to evergreens in plantations (16 contrasts). We also compared net min rates beneath pairs of co-occurring genera. Most pairs of genera did not differ consistently, i.e., tree species from one genus had higher net min at some sites and lower net min at other sites. Moreover, several common deciduous genera (Acer, Betula, Populus) and deciduous Quercus spp. did not typically have higher net min rates than common evergreen genera (Pinus, Picea). There are several reasons why tree effects on net min are poorly predicted by leaf habit and phylogeny. For example, the amount of N mineralized from decomposing leaves might be less than the amount of N mineralized from organic matter pools that are less affected by leaf litter traits, such as dead roots and soil organic matter. Also, effects of plant traits and plant groups on net min probably depend on site-specific factors such as stand age and soil type. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Limitations in available techniques to separate autotrophic (root) and soil heterotrophic respiration have hampered the understanding of forest C cycling. The former is here defined as respiration by roots, their associated mycorrhizal fungi and other micro-organisms in the rhizosphere directly dependent on labile C compounds leaked from roots. In order to separate the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of soil respiration, all Scots pine trees in 900 m(2) plots were girdled to instantaneously terminate the supply of current photosynthates from the tree canopy to roots. Hogberg et al. (Nature 411, 789-792, 2001) reported that autotrophic activity contributed up to 56\% of total soil respiration during the first summer of this experiment. They also found that mobilization of stored starch (and likely also sugars) in roots after girdling caused an increased apparent heterotrophic respiration on girdled plots. Herein a transient increase in the delta(13)C Of Soil CO(2) efflux after girdling, thought to be due to decomposition of (13)C-enriched ectomycorrhizal mycelium and root starch and sugar reserves, is reported. In the second year after girdling, when starch reserves of girdled tree roots were exhausted, calculated root respiration increased up to 65\% of total soil CO(2) efflux. It is suggested that this estimate of its contribution to soil respiration is more precise than the previous based on one year of observation. Heterotrophic respiration declined in response to a 20-day-long 6 degreesC decline in soil temperature during the second summer, whereas root respiration did not decline. This did not support the idea that root respiration should be more sensitive to variations in soil temperature. It is suggested that above-ground photosynthetic activity and allocation patterns of recent photosynthates to roots should be considered in models of responses of forest C balances to global climate change.

AB  - Fungi are essential components of all terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the crucial ecological role of soil fungi in grasslands, knowledge about fungal community diversity and structure in Mediterranean meadow habitats is still fragmentary. We analyzed macrofungal communities in three geographically distinct Mediterranean montane calcareous grasslands and surrounding forests, by means of fruit body surveys. We investigated a number of biotic and abiotic factors influencing the studied fungal communities, including plant species composition. Out of 6365 fruit bodies, a total of 268 species belonging to 84 genera were found. In general, there was a significant correlation between plant species richness and fungal richness. Variation in vegetation and plant community structure accounted for approximately 20% of variance in fungal community structure. Tree and shrub vegetation played a dominant role in shaping the analyzed fungal communities, both in meadows and surrounding forests, with particular influence on ectomycorrhizal, litter, and lignicolous saprotrophic fungi. Fungal biodiversity in the studied meadows was increased by the presence of tree and shrub species from the adjacent forests, but was reduced by the increasing vegetation cover. {\textcopyright} 2020 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis has been proposed to link plant photosynthesis and soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition through the production of fungal enzymes which promote SOM degradation and nitrogen (N) uptake. However, laboratory and field evidence for the existence of these processes are rare. Piloderma sp., a common ECM genus in boreal forest soil, was chosen as model mycorrhiza for this study. The abundance of Piloderma sp. was studied in root tips and soil over one growing season and in winter. Protease production was measured from ectomycorrhiza and soil solution in the field and pure fungal cultures. We also tested the effect of Piloderma olivaceum on host plant organic N nutrition in the laboratory. The results showed that Piloderma sp. was highly abundant in the field and produced extracellular proteases, which correlated positively with the gross primary production, temperature and soil respiration. In the laboratory, Piloderma olivaceum could improve the ability of Pinus sylvestris L. to utilize N from extragenous proteins. We suggest that ECM fungi, although potentially retaining N in their hyphae, are important in forest C and N cycling due to their ability to access proteinaeous N. As Piloderma sp. abundance appeared to be seasonally highly variable, recycling of fungal-bound N after hyphal death may therefore be of primary importance for the N cycling in boreal ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2015 Heinonsalo et al.

AB  - An essential carbon (C) pool of forest ecosystems is stored in belowground tree biomass; however, data about belowground C and nutrient accumulation is scarce. It is crucial to involve belowground part for developing regional and global C or nitrogen (N) budgets for different forest ecosystems. Fine root (D < 2.0 mm) biomass and spatial allocation as well as coarse root (D >= 2.0 mm) biomass were studied in a chronosequence in four silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) stands aged 6-60 years. The soil coring method was used for estimation of birch fine root biomass and necromass in the upper 40 cm topsoil layer. Stump biomass and coarse root biomass were estimated by excavation of the root systems of model trees in a 6-year-old stand and in a 32-year-old silver birch stand. For a 14-year-old stand and for a 60-year-old stand, the developed root-shoot ratio approach was used. Carbon and nitrogen accumulation in belowground biomass was estimated as well. Fine root biomass varied between 103 g m(-2) and 409 g m(-2) and fine root necromass, between 22 g m(-2) and 93 g m(-2); both increased with stand age. Fine root vertical distribution showed a gradual decrease with soil depth in all profiles, however, fine root biomass shifted more to the deeper soil layers with increasing stand age. The fine root live/dead ratio decreased hyperbolically with stand age while the change was most rapid before pole age. The most active part of the fine root system - ectomycorrhizal biomass (EcMB) - was estimated for three stands (6-, 14- and 32-year-old); EcMB per basal area varied between 8 and 14 kg m(-2) and was not related to stand age. Coarse root biomass increased with stand age from 7.9 Mg ha(-1) in the 6-year-old stand to 40.2 Mg ha(-1) in the 60-year-old stand. The root-shoot ratio decreased in silver birch stands drastically between 6 and 14 years but stabilized thereafter. Hence the use of a root-shoot ratio of 21\% for calculation of belowground biomass from aboveground biomass for silver birch stands is justified. Carbon accumulation in the belowground tree biomass of silver birch stands varied between 4.0 Mg ha(-1) and 19.8 Mg ha(-1), being the highest in the 60-year-old stand. The C accumulated in belowground biomass accounted for 3-4\% of the total C storage of the total C storage of the forest ecosystem in the young stands and for 9.5-11\% in the middle-aged and mature stands. Fine root mortality and the corresponding C flow as fine-root litter input increased with stand age. As the biomass of the trees was the main C sink, a significant share (3-28\%) of C was accumulated in the belowground part of the stand. C accumulation in the fine roots was low in chronosequence birch stands; however the C flux into the soil through fine root litter may be considerable. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Basidiomycetes are essential in forest ecology, being deeply involved in wood and litter decomposition, humification, and mineralization of soil organic matter. The fungal oxidoreductases involved in these processes are today the focus of much attention with a view to their applications. The ecological role and potential biotechnological applications of 300 isolates of Basidiomycetes were assessed, taking into account the degradation of model dyes in different culture conditions and the production of oxidoreductase enzymes. The tested isolates belong to different ecophysiological groups (wood-degrading, litter-degrading, ectomycorrhizal, and coprophilous fungi) and represent a broad systematic and functional biodiversity among Basidiomycetes occurring in deciduous and evergreen forests of northwest Italy (Piedmont Region). The high number of species tested and the use of different culture conditions allowed the investigation of the degradation activity of several novel species, neglected to date. Oxidative enzyme activities varied widely among all ecophysiological groups and laccases were the most commonly detected enzymes. A large number of isolates (86%), belonging to all ecophysiological groups, were found to be active against at least one model dye; the wood-degrading fungi represented the most efficient group. Noteworthily, also some isolates of litter-degrading and ectomycorrhizal fungi achieved good decolorization yield. The 25 best isolates were then tested against nine industrial dyes commonly employed in textile industries. Three isolates of Bjerkandera adusta efficiently decolorized the dyes on all media and can be considered important candidates for application in textile wastewater treatment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Functional traits respond to environmental drivers, hence evaluating trait-environment relationships across spatial environmental gradients can help to understand how multiple drivers influence plant communities. Global-change drivers such as changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition occur worldwide, but affect community trait distributions at the local scale, where resources (e.g. light availability) and conditions (e.g. soil pH) also influence plant communities. We investigate how multiple environmental drivers affect community trait responses related to resource acquisition (plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), woodiness, and mycorrhizal status) and regeneration (seed mass, lateral spread) of European temperate deciduous forest understoreys. We sampled understorey communities and derived trait responses across spatial gradients of global-change drivers (temperature, precipitation, nitrogen deposition, and past land use), while integrating in-situ plot measurements on resources and conditions (soil type, Olsen phosphorus (P), Ellenberg soil moisture, light, litter mass, and litter quality). Among the global-change drivers, mean annual temperature strongly influenced traits related to resource acquisition. Higher temperatures were associated with taller understoreys producing leaves with lower SLA, and a higher proportional cover of woody and obligate mycorrhizal (OM) species. Communities in plots with higher Ellenberg soil moisture content had smaller seeds and lower proportional cover of woody and OM species. Finally, plots with thicker litter layers hosted taller understoreys with larger seeds and a higher proportional cover of OM species. Our findings suggest potential community shifts in temperate forest understoreys with global warming, and highlight the importance of local resources and conditions as well as global-change drivers for community trait variation. {\textcopyright} 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands

AB  - This study addressed competition of Scleroconidioma sphagnicola Tsuneda, Currah & Thormann with saprotrophic ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. We isolated this fungus, previously considered as a preferentially necrotrophic parasite of moss, from spruce needle litter. Competition of Scleroconidioma sphagnicola was simulated with strains of the autochthonous litter colonizers Ceuthospora pinastri (Fr.) H{\"{o}}hn., Chalara longipes (Preus) Cooke, Setulipes androsaceus (L.) Anton{\'{i}}n (Marasmius androsaceus (L.) Fr.), and Mollisia minutella (Sacc.) Rehm and the wood-decaying fungus Hypholoma fasciculare (Huds.) Qu{\'{e}}l. Pairings were performed on agar plates with two types of low-nutrient medium made from spruce litter needles. Reisolation on nutritionally rich agar medium following the competition revealed that Sleroconidioma sphagnicola was mostly successfully reisolated even though apparently being replaced by the mycelium of other fungi. It formed strongly melanised mycelium and microsclerotia that seem to be responsible for its resistance to fungal competition. All tested strains of needle litter colonizers were outcompeted by Hypholoma fasciculare. Enzymatic screening aimed at semiquantitative assay of polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, and tyrosinace revealed that Scleroconidioma sphagnicola, together with other strains, was able to produce polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase on various nutritional media. Activity of tyrosinase was detected only for Hypholoma fasciculare. Previous records of Scleroconidioma sphagnicola from moss, wood, and our isolations from spruce litter suggest that this species possesses an ability to occupy a wide spectrum of niches. {\textcopyright} 2006 NRC.

AB  - Ecosystems with ectomycorrhizal plants have high soil carbon : nitrogen ratios, but it is not clear why. The Gadgil effect, where competition between ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi for nitrogen slows litter decomposition, may increase soil carbon. However, experimental evidence for the Gadgil effect is equivocal. Here, we apply resource-ratio theory to assess whether interguild fungal competition for different forms of organic nitrogen can affect litter decomposition. We focus on variation in resource input ratios and fungal resource use traits, and evaluate our model's predictions by synthesizing prior experimental literature examining ectomycorrhizal effects on litter decomposition. In our model, resource input ratios determined whether ectomycorrhizal fungi suppressed saprotrophic fungi. Recalcitrant litter inputs favored the former over the latter, allowing the Gadgil effect only when such inputs predominated. Although ectomycorrhizal fungi did not always hamper litter decomposition, ectomycorrhizal nitrogen uptake always increased carbon : nitrogen ratios in litter. Our meta-analysis of empirical studies supports our theoretical results: ectomycorrhizal fungi appear to slow decomposition of leaf litter only in forests where litter inputs are highly recalcitrant. We thus find that the specific contribution of the Gadgil effect to high soil carbon : nitrogen ratios in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems may be smaller than predicted previously. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

AB  - 1. Mycorrhizae form a critical link between above-ground plants and the soil system by influencing plant nutrition, nutrient cycling and soil structure. Understanding how mycorrhizae respond to disturbances may lead to important advances in interpreting above-ground plant recovery. 2. The inoculum potential for arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi was investigated in thinned-only, thinned and prescribed burned (both restoration treatments) and unthinned and unburned control stands in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. The relationships between mycorrhizal fungal propagule densities and plant community and soil properties were quantified. 3. The relative amount of infective propagules of AM fungi was significantly higher in samples collected from both restoration treatments than their paired controls (unthinned and unburned stands). In contrast, the same restoration treatments had no significant effect on the relative amount of infective propagules of EM fungi. 4. The relative amount of infective propagules of AM fungi was significantly positively correlated with graminoid cover and herbaceous understorey species richness and negatively correlated with overstorey tree canopy cover and litter cover. 5. Synthesis and applications . These results indicate that population densities of AM fungi can rapidly increase following restoration treatments in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. This has important implications for restoring the herbaceous understorey of these forests because most understorey plants depend on AM associations for normal growth. These results also can be applied to other ecosystems that are in a state of restoration or where the role of fire is just beginning to be understood.

AB  - The contents of fungal biomass markers were analysed in the fruit bodies of dominant basidiomycetes from an ectomycorrhiza-dominated coniferous forest, and used to estimate the fungal biomass content in the litter and soil. The content of ergosterol (3.8 +/- 2.0 mg g(-1) dry fungal biomass) and the phospholipid fatty acid 18:2 omega 6,9 (11.6 +/- 4.3 mg g(-1)) showed less variation than the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) copy numbers (375 +/- 294 x 10(9) copies g(-1)). A high level of variation in the ITS copy numbers (per ng DNA) was also found among fungal taxa. The content of fungal biomass in the litter and soil, calculated using the mean contents, varied between 0.66 and 6.24 mg g(-1) fungal biomass in the litter, and 0.22 and 0.68 mg g(-1) in the soil. The ratio of fungal biomass in the litter to that in the soil varied greatly among the markers. The estimates of fungal biomass obtained with different biomarkers are not exactly comparable, and caution should be used when analysing taxon abundance using PCR amplification of fungal rDNA.

AB  - Two 0.1-ha plots, each divided into 10 contiguous subplots, were established in a Quercus-dominated deciduous forest in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Macrofungi were surveyed on these plots at weekly intervals during the fruiting season over 3 years. During this survey 177 species were recorded, including 30 species inhabiting leaf litter, 36 ectomycorrhizal species, 29 non-mycorrhizal soil-inhabiting species, and 79 wood-inhabiting species. This species richness is comparable to, but slightly higher than, that reported by other plot-based studies undertaken in hardwood forests. We compared the ability of seven species-richness estimation techniques to 'determine the true species richness on these plots. While some estimators performed better than others, in general the estimations were too low based on the following year's data and were not consistent from year to year. We found some evidence of spatial autocorrelation of communities of fungi found in adjacent subplots. This indicates that the benefit of using contiguous subplots to increase the homogeneity of the area sampled needs to be balanced against the possibility of underestimating the species richness of an area because of spatial autocorrelation.

AB  - Research Highlights: Moderate thinning can effectively improve forestry production and change the microenvironment of understory vegetation. Background and Objectives: Microbial communities control the decomposition and transformation of forest organic matter; however, the influence of thinning on microbes in the organic horizon remains unclear. Materials and Methods: In this study, we subjected four plots of Chinese pine plantations in Badaling, Beijing to different thinning intensities, including no thinning (T0), low-intensity thinning (T10), medium-intensity thinning (T20), and high-intensity thinning (T50). The changes in chemical properties and microbial community compositions observed in the organic horizon, which comprised undecomposed litter (L layer) and half-decomposed litter (F layer), were analyzed after thinning. Microbial community compositions were evaluated using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) methods. Results: The results showed that the abundances of gram-negative bacteria (GN) and total bacteria (B) under the T10 thinning condition were the highest among the four thinning intensities, and the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in T20 was higher than under other thinning intensities. The abundance of gram-positive bacteria (GP) and actinobacteria (ACT) in T10 was lower than in both T0 and T50. The abundance of total PLFAs and fungi (FU) was higher in the L layer, whereas the abundance of GP, GN, B, ACT, and AMF was higher in the F layer. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the L layer better reflects the influence of thinning on litter. Redundancy analysis (RDA) results indicated that the organic carbon (LOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and ammonium nitrogen (NH4 +-N)contents of litter were primarily responsible for the observed changes in microbial community structure, with LOC alone explaining 62.6% of the total variance among the litter substrate factors selected. Overall, moderate-intensity thinning of Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. plantations created more favorable conditions for microbial communities in the organic horizon. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Suites of fungal adaptation to nutrient acquisition and allocation of vegetations are observed along forest succession gradients. However, the mechanisms behind seral shifts in plant-associated fungi need to be uncovered. To bridge this knowledge gap, the current study investigated the litter and soil chemical variables as well as the fungal community using high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing along a 30a-100a succession gradient of a subtropical forest ecosystem in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. Litter nitrogen (N) content changed consistently with fungal alpha-diversity and the relative abundances of functional guilds, such as saprotrophs and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, this trend was opposite to that observed for ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi and litter carbon (C) content. The total and water-soluble C and N contents as well as the C/N ratios in soil decreased with stand age, while the relative abundances of Rozellomycota, Chytridiomycota and lichens as well as the microbial C and N use efficiencies exhibited increasing trends across succession stages. Multivariate analysis and multiple linear regression showed that the seral shifts in fungal diversity and composition were closely related to the C:N stoichiometry of soil and litter. Specifically, the litter C content either negatively explained the alpha-diversity and saprotroph abundance or positively explained the abundance of EcM fungi. In contrast, the litter N content presented opposite trends. Further, the variances in the abundances of Rozellomycota and AM fungi were negatively explained by water-soluble C content but positively explained by water-soluble N content in the soil. These findings confirm that the replenishment and reduction of available nutrients are determined by plant-fungus interactions via the C:N stoichiometry of litter and soil along the forest chronosequence. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Trees allocate a large portion of gross primary production belowground for the production and maintenance of roots and mycorrhizae. The difficulty of directly measuring total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA) has limited our understanding of belowground carbon (C) cycling and the factors that control this important flux. We measured TBCA over 4 years using a conservation of mass, C balance approach in replicate stands of fast growing Eucalyptus saligna Smith with different nutrition management and tree density treatments. We measured TBCA as surface carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux ({''}soil{''} respiration) minus C inputs from above-ground litter plus the change in C stored in roots, litter, and soil. We evaluated this C balance approach to measuring TBCA by examining (a) the variance in TBCA across replicate plots; (b) cumulative error associated with summing components to arrive at our estimates of TBCA; (c) potential sources of error in the techniques and assumptions; (d) the magnitude of changes in C stored in soil, litter, and roots compared to TBCA; and (e) the sensitivity of our measures of TBCA to differences in nutrient availability, tree density, and forest age. The C balance method gave precise estimates of TBCA and reflected differences in belowground allocation expected with manipulations of fertility and tree density. Across treatments, TBCA averaged 1.88 kg C m(-2) y(-1) and was 18\% higher in plots planted with 10(4) trees/ha compared to plots planted with 1111 trees/ha. TB CA was 12\% lower (but not significantly so) in fertilized plots. For all treatments, TBCA declined linearly with stand age. The coefficient of variation (CV) for TBCA for replicate plots averaged 17\%. Averaged across treatments and years, annual changes in C stored in soil, the litter layer, and coarse roots (-0.01, 0.06, and 0.21 kg C m(-2) y(-1), respectively) were small compared with surface CO2 efflux (2.03 kg C m(-2) y(-1)), aboveground litterfall (0.42 kg C m(-2) y(-1)), and our estimated TBCA (1.88 kg C m(-2) y(-1)). Based on studies from similar sites, estimates of losses of C through leaching, erosion, or storage of C in deep soil were less than 1\% of annual TBCA.

AB  - Logging residues, consisting of branches and treetops, are increasingly being extracted for biofuel purposes in Fennoscandia, thereby decreasing the availability of fine woody debris (FWD). Little is known about the importance of FWD and litter to fungal diversity, although they constitute the major components of dead organic matter in both managed and natural forests. We investigated the long-term effects of removing logging residue on the saprotrophic fungi community in the litter layer by using an experiment established 25 years ago, comprising stands with and without removal of clear-cut slash. The fungal communities were identified using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism from standardized baits of wood and needles left in the litter layer for 30 months. A total of 74 fungal taxa were recorded. No differences in species richness or frequency of abundant species were detected between the stands with and without slash removal, suggesting that the extraction of logging residues has a negligible long-term impact on abundant saprotrophic fungi. Twenty-five of the 36 abundant species colonized wood and needles indiscriminately, while 10 species occurred exclusively on wood or needles and only one species mainly on wood. The importance of litter to certain wood-inhabiting fungi may therefore be underrated. The frequent records of Trichaptum abietinum (Dicks.) Ryvarden indicate that wood-inhabiting species may, surprisingly, be found in the litter layer.

AB  - Decomposition of plant litter by the soil microbial community is an important process of controlling nutrient cycling and soil humus formation. Fungal laccases are key players in litter-associated polyphenol degradation, but little is known about the diversity and spatial distribution of fungal species with laccase genes in soils. Diversity of basidiomycete laccase genes was assessed in a cambisolic forest soil, and the spatial distribution of the sequences was mapped in a 100-m2 plot by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on soil DNA extracts. Diversity of laccase sequences was higher in the organic horizon and decreased with the depth. A total of 167 different sequences sharing 44-96% oligonucleotide similarity was found in 13 soil cores harvested in the 100-m2 plot. Dissimilarity in laccase sequence content was 67% between adjacent cores; 45.5%, 35.5% and 19% of laccase sequences were attributed to ectomycorrhizal, unknown and saprotrophic basidiomycetes, respectively. Most dominant sequences were attributed to the extramatrical hyphae of known ectomycorrhizal taxa (e.g., Russulaceae) and restricted to small patches (<0.77 m2) in a specific soil horizon. Soil fungi with laccase genes occupied different niches and showed strikingly variable distribution patterns. The distribution of laccase sequences, and corresponding fungi, likely reflected a part of the oxidative potential in soils. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.

AB  - Although most plant products eventually enter the below-ground subsystem as plant litter, relatively little is known about the effects of plant litter diversity or composition on ecosystem processes and no study has considered the responses of plant growth to these factors. We conducted an experiment in which humus substrate was collected from three field sites in the boreal forest of northern Sweden. Litter was then placed on the humus surface and the litter used consisted of monocultures of Empetrum hermaphroditum (dwarf shrub), Betula pendula (tree), and Pleurozium schreberi (feather moss), as well as mixtures containing all the possible (two-way and three-way) combinations of these species; the experiment was maintained in out-door conditions. Although decomposition rates of this surface-placed litter differed between species few effects of litter mixing on litter mass loss were apparent. Added litter of Pinus sylvestris litter broke down most slowly when placed in E. hermaphroditum litter but sometimes showed elevated decomposition rates when placed in some of the multiple species litter mixes. Soil microbial biomass and activity was lowest when plant litter was absent, but as long as plant litter was present on the humus surface the species composition and diversify of the litter was irrelevant. There were Few effects of litter treatments on growth of seedlings of either B. pendula or P. sylvestris,is planted into the humus. However, for one site there were significant effects of mixing litter of P. schreberi and E. hermaphroditum in reducing growth of both seedling species. Litter treatments generally did not alter the competitive balance between B. pendula and P. sylvestris is seedlings when grown together but for all sites litter treatments had significant effects on the overall intensity of competition, and mixing of litter of B. pendula and P. schreberi had significant non-additive effects on competition intensity for two of the three sites. The abundance of mycorrhizae on seedlings was only weakly related to litter treatment but there were some positive effects of litter mixing on one of the most abundant mycorrhizal morphotypes on both species of seedlings for one of the sites. Our results suggest that litter presence was important in influencing a range of above ground and below ground properties and processes. In some instances individual species effects and litter mixing effects were also important but few general patterns emerged, and the nature of significant effects tended to be idiosyncratic. Ultimately our results show that plant litter has important ``afterlife effects{''} which need to be considered in order to develop a more complete understanding of how biodiversity affects ecosystems.

AB  - Focusing on Sumatra, a hotspot of tropical lowland rainforest transformation, we investigated effects of the conversion of rainforests into rubber agroforests (“jungle rubber”), intensive rubber, and oil palm plantations on the communities of litter and soil microorganisms and identified factors responsible for these changes. Litter basal respiration, microbial biomass, total bacterial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and fungal PLFAs did not vary significantly with rainforest conversion. In litter of converted ecosystems, the concentration of certain PLFAs including the Gram-negative bacteria marker PLFA cy17:0 and the Gram-positive bacteria marker PLFA i17:0 was reduced as compared to rainforest, whereas the concentration of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) marker neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA) 16:1$\omega$5c increased. As indicated by redundancy analysis, litter pH and carbon concentration explained most of the variation in litter microbial community composition. In soil, microbial biomass did not vary significantly with rainforest conversion, whereas basal respiration declined. Total PLFAs and especially that of Gram-negative bacteria decreased, whereas PLFA i17:0 increased with rainforest conversion. The concentration of fungal PLFAs increased with rainforest conversion, whereas NLFA 16:1$\omega$5c did not change significantly. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil pH explained most of the variation in soil microbial community composition. Overall, the data suggest that conversion of rainforests into production systems results in more pronounced changes in microbial community composition in soil as compared to litter. In particular, the response of fungi and bacteria was more pronounced in soil, while the response of AMF was more pronounced in litter. Notably, only certain bacterial markers but not those of saprotrophic fungi and AMF were detrimentally affected by rainforest conversion. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The spatial distribution of the genets of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor was studied by somatic incompatibility, two years after removal of the litter and humus layers in two plots of 225 m2 in a 17-years-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stand in The Netherlands. Pairings of isolates revealed the presence of three and four genets on the two sites. Genets were up to 12{\textperiodcentered}5 m in size, indicating that mycelia are perennial and are of importance for mycelial spread. Age of the genets was estimated at 13 to 26 and 16 to 31 years, for the two sites. The smallest genet was represented by two sporocarps suggesting recent colonization by spores. {\textcopyright} 1994, British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Early establishment of white spruce (Picea glauca) in mixedwood boreal forest stands following fire was examined at several times-since-fire (1-, 2-, 4-, 6-, 14-years). Abiotic and biotic conditions in the stands were assessed at two scales, tree plot (5 in x 5 in) and microsite (1 m x 1 m), along with presence, density and height of white spruce seedlings. Germination and survival of seed sown 1- and 4-years post fire were quantified. Survival and growth of nursery-grown seedlings, and mycorrhizal colonization, survival and growth of sterile seedlings, planted 1-year post-fire were assessed. At the tree plot scale, presence of white spruce seedlings 1-year post-fire could be reliably predicted by organic layer depth and distance to and strength of seed source. In contrast, none of the biotic or abiotic factors measured was strongly correlated with occurrence or density of white spruce seedlings 6- and 14- years post-fire. At the microsite scale, seedling recruitment immediately post-fire was limited to a distinct subset of available microsites (greater \% cover of downed wood and moss, lower \% cover of litter and herbaceous vegetation). Likewise, seedling occurrence in older bums was associated with distinct microsite conditions; although this was more likely an effect of white spruce presence, rather than the cause. Less than 3\% of seed sown 1 yr post-fire survived to become 1 yr old germinants, survival was 41\% over the next three years. Availability of suitable regeneration microsites declines rapidly with time-since-fire; less than 0.3\% of seed sown 4 yrs post-fire survived one year. High rates of mycorrhizal colonization were found on white spruce seedlings planted 1-year post-fire, including early and late stage fungal species. Micrositc characteristics were only weakly correlated with mycorrhizal fungal communities. We propose that immediate post-fire recruitment of white spruce is a key process in mixedwood boreal succession.

AB  - Aims: Our aims were to characterize the fate of leaf-litter-derived nitrogen in the plant-soil-microbe system of a temperate beech forest of Southern Germany and to identify its importance for N nutrition of beech seedlings. Methods: 15N-labelled leaf litter was traced in situ into abiotic and biotic N pools in mineral soil as well as into beech seedlings and mycorrhizal root tips over three growing seasons. Results: There was a rapid transfer of 15N into the mineral soil already 21 days after tracer application with soil microbial biomass initially representing the dominant litter-N sink. However, 15N recovery in non-extractable soil N pools strongly increased over time and subsequently became the dominant 15N sink. Recovery in plant biomass accounted for only 0.025 % of 15N excess after 876 days. After three growing seasons, 15N excess recovery was characterized by the following sequence: non-extractable soil N >> extractable soil N including microbial biomass >> plant biomass > ectomycorrhizal root tips. Conclusions: After quick vertical dislocation and cycling through microbial N pools, there was a rapid stabilization of leaf-litter-derived N in non-extractable N pools of the mineral soil. Very low 15N recovery in beech seedlings suggests a high importance of other N sources such as root litter for N nutrition of beech understorey. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - We hypothesized that dinitrogen (N2)- and non-N2-fixing tropical trees would have distinct phosphorus (P) acquisition strategies allowing them to exploit different P sources, reducing competition. We measured root phosphatase activity and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization among two N2- and two non-N2-fixing seedlings, and grew them alone and in competition with different inorganic and organic P forms to assess potential P partitioning. We found an inverse relationship between root phosphatase activity and AM colonization in field-collected seedlings, indicative of a trade-off in P acquisition strategies. This correlated with the predominantly exploited P sources in the seedling experiment: the N2 fixer with high N2 fixation and root phosphatase activity grew best on organic P, whereas the poor N2 fixer and the two non-N2 fixers with high AM colonization grew best on inorganic P. When grown in competition, however, AM colonization, root phosphatase activity and N2 fixation increased in the N2 fixers, allowing them to outcompete the non-N2 fixers regardless of P source. Our results indicate that some tropical trees have the capacity to partition soil P, but this does not eliminate interspecific competition. Rather, enhanced P and N acquisition strategies may increase the competitive ability of N2 fixers relative to non-N2 fixers. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Five different species of known ecto-mycorrhizal fungi: Cenococcum geophilum, Amanita muscaria, Tricholoma aurantium, Rhizopogon luteolus and Rhizopogon roseolus were studied for their ability to metabolize the major components of plant cell walls. All strains were able to decompose 14C-labelled plant lignin, 14C-lignocellulose and 14C-DHP-lignin at a rate which was lower than the one observed for the known white rot fungi Heterobasidion annosum and Sporotrichum pulverulentum. Also 14C-(U)-holocellulose was relatively less degradable for the mycorrhizal fungi than for the white rotters. On the other hand, aromatic monomers like 14C-vanillic acid were decomposed to a much higher extent by two species of mycorrhizal fungi compared to the activity observed for Heterobasidion annosum. The results of the experiments reveal that these stains of mycorrhizal fungi are well able to utilize the major components of plant material and thus can contribute to litter decomposition in the forest floor. {\textcopyright} 1984 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Field studies to test the effects of natural levels of allelopathic compounds on coexisting native species are rare because allelopathic effects are difficult to quantify and evaluate under the field conditions. Field studies are conducted to demonstrate the effects of allelochemicals on ecosystem-level (through effects on litter decomposition, activity of decomposers, soil C and N cycling, soil humus, soil nutrients availability, soil water relation and soil respiration, plant mycorrhizal fungi and plant pathogens) and also to test allelopathic potential of allelochemical compounds from fresh leaves, leaf litter and soil of donor species on individuals of the same species (autotoxicity) and on coexisting species (growth, photosynthesis, respiration, chlorophyll and water relations of target plants) in forest community, through simultaneous measurements of allelochemical content in fresh leaves, leaf litter and in soil in experimental and control plots. This paper describes some field research methods and techniques to screen and monitor the effects of allelochemicals in forest ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding factors that regulate ecosystem responses to disturbances is a long-standing ecological goal and has been useful in predicting the effects of global change. The response of an ecosystem to a single perturbation does not necessarily predict its response to repeated perturbations—highlighting the ‘pulse' vs. ‘press' framework to predict ecosystem responses to single or recurring perturbations, respectively. This framework can help guide hypotheses around how ecosystems may, or may not, respond to changes in disturbance regimes. Here we apply the pulse-press framework to understand fire effects on soils and plant communities. Specifically, we combine a quantitative meta-analysis on the response of soil carbon and nutrients with a literature review of the response of microbial and plant communities. We argue that fire is a cumulative disturbance driving a ‘press' response and can be both coupled and decoupled from the ‘pulse' response to a single burn depending on whether the response variable is regulated by the direct effects of heating or the indirect effects of changing plant and microbial communities. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that carbon and nutrient content in mineral soils responded differently because carbon and nitrogen, which are volatilized to the atmosphere in a fire and turn over relatively slowly in soil, are regulated by the long-term losses of plant biomass inputs more so than heating-induced volatilization, and thus change relatively little in a single fire. Contrastingly, the elements calcium, potassium, and phosphorus, which are enriched in ash because of their resistance to volatilization, are regulated by the intermittent pulses into the soil following a fire. A literature review suggests microbial biomass and decomposition activity tended to decline after a single fire because of heat-induced mortality, which was consistent with the effects of repeated burning, likely due to combined effects of repeated heat-induced mortality and lower soil organic matter. Another important ‘press' response was how nutrient losses shape the nutrient use strategies of plants (tissue stoichiometry and nutrient acquisition strategy) and how changes in plant strategies influence soil responses. Past studies have generally found that species with low nutrient concentrations in biomass, high nutrient recycling before tissue senescence, and a greater reliance on mycorrhizal symbioses tend to increase in abundance with frequent burning. Many of these traits likely lead to slower decomposition and nutrient availability, but few studies have rigorously linked fire-driven shifts in traits with carbon and nitrogen cycling. The processes we have identified are likely to be especially important in tropical ecosystems, where disturbance by fire is shifting rapidly, attributable to changes in land use and climate. Tropical savannas are some of the most responsive landscapes to altered fire regimes, with large changes in soil carbon and nutrients, suggesting that shifts in fire regimes may change the carbon balance of these ecosystems substantially. We propose that more fire-manipulation experiments are needed in tropical forests, especially in moist forests where plants are not as well adapted to fire. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nutrient conservation in vegetation affects rates of litter decomposition and soil nutrient availability. Although resorption has been traditionally considered one of the most important plant strategies to conserve nutrients in temperate forests, long leaf life-span and low nutrient requirements have been postulated as better indicators. We aimed at identifying nutrient conservation strategies within characteristic functional groups of NW Patagonian forests on Andisols. We analysed C-, N-, P-, K- and lignin-concentrations in mature and senescent leaves of ten native woody species within the functional groups: broad-leaved deciduous species, broad-leaved evergreens and conifers. We also examined mycorrhizal associations in all species. Nutrient concentration in mature leaves and N- resorption were higher in broad-leaved deciduous species than in the other two functional groups. Conifers had low mature leaf nutrient concentrations, low N-resorption and high lignin/N ratios in senescent leaves. P- and K-resorptions did not differ among functional groups. Broad-leaved evergreens exhibited a species-dependent response. Nitrogen in mature leaves was positively correlated with both N resorption and soil N-fertility. Despite the high P-retention capacity of Andisols, N appeared to be the more limiting nutrient, with most species being proficient in resorbing N but not P. The presence of endomycorrhizae in all conifers and the broad-leaved evergreen Maytenus boaria, ectomycorrhizae in all Nothofagus species (four deciduous, one evergreen), and cluster roots in the broad-leaved evergreen Lomatia hirsuta, would be possibly explaining why P is less limiting than N in these forests.

AB  - A headfire upward along the crest to the peak of a foothill during February 1988 had been prescribed to lower the possibility of a wildfire during the dry season on the Jefferson National Forest. Some surface litter plus annual and perennial stems on one-half of a stand of Pinus pungens/P. rigida had been destroyed. Subsequent development of ectomycorrhizal sporophores of basidiomycetes was recorded regularly within equal areas of burned and unburned portions and within a nearby unburned stand of P. virginiana. Each plot had a few ectomycorrhizal hardwoods, mainly Quercus spp. First fruiting was noted under burned P. pungens 3 weeks after a general rain in mid-July and after 4 weeks under both. By the end of November, when fruiting ceased, 138 separable taxa had been collected of which 95 had been identified. A list of the fungi and data on current and previously reported host associations, occurrence on each of the substrates, times and frequencies of fruiting, periodicity of genera, and variations in weather conditions are presented. {\textcopyright} 1994 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The Aspen free-air carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment (FACE) experiment tested how three developing forest communities responded to elevated concentrations of CO2 and/or tropospheric ozone (O3). Throughout the 11-year experiment, elevated CO2 increased aboveground productivity, whereas the initial negative effects of elevated O3 on aboveground productivity became insignificant over time. During the first 2 years, fine root biomass and soil respiration responded positively to elevated CO2 and negatively to elevated O3. However, after 5 years, O3 effects on fine root biomass were weakly negative or positive and effects on soil respiration were positive. Despite altering litter inputs, neither elevated O3 nor elevated CO2 affected overall soil C storage at the end of the experiment, consistent with observations that elevated CO2 increased and elevated O3 tended to decrease the activity of litter-degrading extracellular enzymes. Overall, our understanding of belowground processes is still insufficient to predict how ecosystems will respond to global change. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background. Fungal endophytes inhabit symptomless, living tissues of all major plant lineages to form one of earth's most prevalent groups of symbionts. Many reproduce from senesced and/or decomposing leaves and can produce extracellular leaf degrading enzymes, blurring the line between symbiotrophy and saprotrophy. To better understand the endophyte saprotroph continuum we compared fungal communities and functional traits of focal strains isolated from living leaves to those isolated from leaves after senescence and decomposition, with a focus on foliage of woody plants in five biogeographic provinces ranging from tundra to subtropical scrub forest. Methods. We cultured fungi from the interior of surface-sterilized leaves that were living at the time. of sampling (i.e., dophytes), leaves that were dead and were retained in plant canopies (dead leaf fungi,eDn LF), and fallen. leaves (leaf litter.fungi,LLF) from 3-4 species of woody plants in each of five sites in. North America. Our sampling encompassed 18 plant species. representing. two families of Pinophyta.and five families of Angiospermae. Diversity and composition of fungal communities within and among leaf life stages, hosts, and sites were compared using ITS-partial L SU rDNA data. We evaluated substrate use and enzyme activity by a subset of fungi isolated'onlyfrom living tissues vs. fungi isolated only from non-living leaves. Results Across the diverse biomes and plant taxa surveyed here, culturable fungi living leays were isolated less frequently and were less diverse than those isolated from non-living leaves. Fungal communities in living leaves also differed detectably in composition from communities in dead leaves and leaf litter within focal sites and host taxa, regardless of differential weighting of rare and abundant fungi. All focal isolates grew on cellulose, lignin, and pectin as sole carbon sources, but none displayed igninolytic or pectinolytic activity in vitro. Cellulolytic activity differed among fungal classes. Within Dothideomycetes, activity differed significantly between fungi from living vs. non-living leaves, but such differences were not observed in Sordariomycetes. Discussion. Although some fungi with endophytic life stages clearly persist for periods of time in leaves after senescence and incorporation into leaf litter, our sampling across diverse biomes and host lineages detected consistent differences between fungal assemblages in living vs. non-living leaves, reflecting incursion by fungi from the leaf exterior after leaf death and as leaves begin to decompose. However, fungi found only in living leaves do not differ consistently in cellulolytic activity from those fungi detected thus far only in dead leaves. Future analyses should consider Basidiornycota in addition to the Ascomycota fungi evaluated here, and should explore more dimensions of functional traits and persistence to further define the endophytism-to-saprotrophy continuum.

AB  - Extramatrical mycelia (EMM) of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are potentially extensive in soil and receive significant allocations of plant-derived carbon. Although losses from living EMM occur via respiration and exudation, EMM represents a considerable biomass component and potential carbon sink in many forest soils. ECM root tips and rhizomorphs may persist in soil for many months, but interactions between grazing arthropods and decomposers probably facilitate more rapid turnover of diffuse EMM. Elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration [CO 2] is likely to increase carbon allocation to ECM fungi by their tree hosts. This will probably increase root colonization by ECM fungi and drive changes in their communities in soil. The likely effects of elevated [CO 2] and other climate change factors on the production and turnover of EMM production are difficult to predict from current evidence, and this hampers our understanding of their potential value as future carbon sinks. Responses of grazing soil arthropods to future climate change will have a strong influence on EMM turnover, along with the abilities of ECM fungi to store carbon in below-ground, and this should be seen as a priority area for future research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to plant litter, forest soil is rich in complex carbohydrates (e.g., cellulose and lignin). Nevertheless, these carbohydrates are only slowly degraded by specialized microorganisms and thus forest soils are rather poor in readily cleavable carbohydrates that are necessary for the growth of the majority of microbes including ectomycorrhizal fungi. Basidiomycetes are able to transfer nutrients and metabolites over long distances. Exploring a rich source of readily utilizable carbohydrates would thus favor the colonization of other soil areas, too. The association with fine roots of woody plants forming ectomycorrhizas is a way that secures exclusive access to such a rich carbohydrate source for ectomycorrhizal fungi. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004, 2008.

AB  - Boreal forests harbour diverse fungal communities with decisive roles in decomposition and plant nutrition. Although changes in boreal plant communities along gradients in soil acidity and nitrogen (N) availability are well described, less is known about how fungal taxonomic and functional groups respond to soil fertility factors. We analysed fungal communities in humus and litter from 25 Swedish old-growth forests, ranging from N-rich Picea abies stands to acidic and N-poor Pinus sylvestris stands. 454-pyrosequencing of ITS2 amplicons was used to analyse community composition, and biomass was estimated by ergosterol analysis. Fungal community composition was significantly related to soil fertility at the levels of species, genera/orders and functional groups. Ascomycetes dominated in less fertile forests, whereas basidiomycetes increased in abundance in more fertile forests, both in litter and humus. The relative abundance of mycorrhizal fungi in the humus layer remained high even in the most fertile soils. Tolerance to acidity and nitrogen deficiency seems to be of greater importance than plant carbon (C) allocation patterns in determining responses of fungal communities to soil fertility, in old-growth boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 2015 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - Forest litter and soil may contain >10 × 106 individual nematodes{\textperiodcentered}m-2 and, regionally, >400 species. Root-feeding nematodes may be pathogenic to young plants; microbial-feeding nematodes may increase turnover of the microbial pool; predacious and omnivorous nematodes represent higher trophic levels. The spatial distribution and abundance of nematode species in forests reflect soil type, soil fertility, climate, canopy and understorey plant species, litter depth, forest age, and management. Nematodes may be important in forest nurseries; they occur throughout the rooting depth of forest trees; hyphal-feeding species may influence mycorrhizae; and insect-vectored Bursaphelenchus species are a quarantine risk. Nematode populations interact with those of other soil animals (e.g., mites, tardigrades, enchytraeids, and protozoa). The diversity and abundance of the nematode assemblage make nematodes a useful indicator of soil condition and soil processes. Information available from forest systems suggests that, as long as physical disturbance is minimized and remaining trees or herb layer moderate the microclimate, logging and other forestry operations have only transitory effects on nematode populations. Extreme disturbance, such as bulldozing and slash-and-burn management, can significantly reduce nematode abundance and diversity. In contrast, management that enhances growth of understorey or herb layer can stimulate nematode populations. Each of these changes can be related to changes in food resource availability and environmental conditions, such as soil temperature and moisture. Although details of soil nematode contributions to nutrient processes in forest soils are sparse, that their populations are maintained through cycles of moderate management practices suggest that their beneficial contributions will also be maintained. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC.

Significant correlations of the density of pine undergrowth with the litter thickness; of its growth with root competition, stand closeness, and, to a lower degree, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); and of the numbers of small mammals and groups of soil mesofauna with herbaceous phytomass have been found. The possibility of the synthesis of population-ecological, synecological, and biogeocenological methods has been demonstrated.

AB  - Forest soils represent important terrestrial carbon (C) pools, where C is primarily fixed in plant biomass and then is incorporated in the biomass of fungi and bacteria. Although classical concepts assume that fungi are the main decomposers of the recalcitrant organic matter within plant and microbial biomass, whereas bacteria are considered to mostly utilize simpler compounds, recent studies have shown that fungi and bacteria overlap in substrate utilization. Here, we studied the microbial contribution to the recycling of dead biomass by analyzing the bacterial and fungal communities in soil microcosms supplemented with 13C-labeled biomass of plant, fungal, and bacterial origin using a combination of DNA-stable isotope probing and metagenomics. Both fungi and bacteria contributed actively to the degradation of complex components of plant and microbial biomass. Specific families of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme) were involved in the degradation of each biomass type. Moreover, the analysis of five bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes indicated the key role of some bacterial genera in the degradation of plant biomass (Cytophaga and Asticcacaulis) and microbial biomass (Herminiimonas). The enzymatic systems utilized by bacteria are highly complex and complementary but also highly diverse among taxa. The results confirm the importance of bacteria, in addition to fungi, as decomposers of complex organic matter in forest soils. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The turnover of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal biomass represents an important litter input into forest biogeochemical cycles. Cenococcum geophilum is a nearly ubiquitous and often abundant EM fungus, making the turnover dynamics of this species relevant and important across forest ecosystems. To better understand the turnover dynamics of C geophilum ectomycorrhizas we examined their persistence using minirhizotron imaging and vitality status using a fluorescein diacetate (FDA) stain and contrasted these results with ectomycorrhizas of other EM fungi. Ectomycorrhizas formed by C. geophilum persisted 4-10 times longer and exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns of vitality compared to ectomycorrhizas of other EM fungi. Together, this suggests that litter resulting from the death of C geophilum ectomycorrhizas is relatively recalcitrant to decay and may disproportionately influence forest biogeochemical cycles by retarding the rate at which carbon and nutrients are cycled.

AB  - Prior to the 1950s, common partial harvesting operations in the southern Appalachians USA involved the removal of logs by ground-skidding and the construction of steep access roads and skid trails along stream channels. Little is known about how these historical practices affected long-term vegetation changes. An experimental watershed in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory was partially harvested in the years 1942–1952 according to these exploitive practices. We compared the partial-cut watershed to a clear-cut watershed and an untreated, reference watershed. Using long-term vegetation surveys, we analyzed patterns in aboveground biomass accumulation, species composition and diversity (Shannon's index Hʹ and species richness) among watersheds. Contrary to our expectations, the partial-cut watershed recovered to reference levels of aboveground biomass and their species composition was similar over time. The clear-cut watershed had greater abundance of tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) than the other two watersheds. The partial-cut watershed increased in diversity over time, but it remained less diverse than the reference watershed; whereas, the clear-cut watershed had lower diversity than the other two watersheds, and its diversity did not change over time. Distributions of functional groups based on water use and nutrient acquisition traits, and shade tolerance were similar between the partial-cut and the reference watersheds, but differed from the clear-cut watershed. By the 2010s, partial-cut and reference watersheds had similar proportions of diffuse-porous (32% and 33%) and ring-porous (48% and 42%) basal area, while the clear-cut watershed had more diffuse-porous (43%) and less ring-porous (36%) species than the partial-cut or reference watersheds. Tree species associated with arbuscular mycorrhiza were more abundant in the clear-cut watershed than the partial-cut or reference watersheds. Overall, the partial-cut watershed, even with the extreme soil disturbance, did not alter long-term species composition and diversity as dramatically as the clear-cut watershed. These results could help forest managers, conservationists, and hydrologists understand the long-term effects of partial-cutting versus clear-cutting. {\textcopyright} 2019, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.

AB  - Human activities affect both tree species composition and diversity in forested ecosystems. This in turn alters the species diversity of plant litter and litter quality, which may have cascading effects on soil microbial communities and their functions for decomposition and nutrient cycling. We tested microbial responses to litter species diversity in a leaf litter decomposition experiment including monocultures, 2-, and 4-species mixtures in the subtropical climate zone of southeastern China. Soil microbial community composition was assessed by lipid analysis, and microbial functions were measured using extracellular enzyme activity and gross rates of nitrogen mineralization. We observed a positive relationship between litter species diversity and abundances of mycorrhizal fungi and actinomycetes. Alternatively, enzyme activities involved in carbon and phosphorus acquisition, and enzyme indices of relative carbon limitation, were higher only in the 4-species mixtures. This suggests that the minimum basal substrate level for enzyme production was reached, or that limitation was higher, at the highest diversity level only. Responses to litter diversity also changed over time, where phosphatase responses to litter diversity were strongest early in decomposition and the indices of carbon limitation relative to other nutrients showed stronger responses later in decomposition. Enzyme activities were related to lipid biomarker data and the mass of litter remaining at the third time point, but relationships between enzyme activity and the mass of litter remaining were not consistent across other time points. We conclude that litter species richness will likely only reduce microbial functions at key intervals of diversity loss while microbial growth is more sensitive to incremental diversity loss, with no clear relationships between them or to ecosystem functions. The observed litter diversity effects on soil microbial biomass and enzyme activity indicate interactions of aboveground and belowground communities, and together with environmental conditions they are important for maintaining ecosystem functions. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - The turnover of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal biomass represents a significant input into forest carbon (C) and nutrient cycles. Given the size of these fluxes, understanding the factors that control the decomposition of this necromass will greatly improve understanding of C and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Recent research has highlighted the considerable variation in the decomposition rates of EM fungal necromass, and patterns from this research are beginning to emerge. In this article we review the research that has examined both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that control the decomposition of EM fungal necromass and propose additional factors that may strongly influence EM fungal necromass decomposition and ecosystem properties. We argue that, as with most plant litters, the stoichiometry (C:N) of EM necromass is an important factor governing decomposition, but its role is modulated by the nature of the C and N in the tissue. In particular, melanin concentration appears to negatively influence the quality of EM fungal necromass much as lignin does in plant litters. Other intrinsic factors such as the morphology of the mycelium may also play a large role and suggest this as a focus for future research. Extrinsic factors, such as decomposer community activity and physical protection by soil, are also likely to be important in governing the decomposition of ectomycorrhizal necromass in situ. Finally, we highlight the potential importance of EM fungal necromass diversity and abundance in influencing terrestrial biogeochemical cycles. Understanding the factors that control the decomposition of EM necromass will then improve the predictive power of next-generation terrestrial biosphere models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background and Aims Most fully mycoheterotrophic (MH) orchids investigated to date are mycorrhizal with fungi that simultaneously form ectomycorrhizas with forest trees. Only a few MH orchids are currently known to be mycorrhizal with saprotrophic, mostly wood-decomposing, fungi instead of ectomycorrhizal fungi. This study provides evidence that the importance of associations between MH orchids and saprotrophic non-Rhizoctonia fungi is currently under-estimated. Methods Using microscopic techniques and molecular approaches, mycorrhizal fungi were localized and identified for seven MH orchid species from four genera and two subfamilies, Vanilloideae and Epidendroideae, growing in four humid and warm sub-tropical forests in Taiwan. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope natural abundances of MH orchids and autotrophic reference plants were used in order to elucidate the nutritional resources utilized by the orchids. Key Results Six out of the seven MH orchid species were mycorrhizal with either wood- or litter-decaying saprotrophic fungi. Only one orchid species was associated with ectomycorrhizal fungi. Stable isotope abundance patterns showed significant distinctions between orchids mycorrhizal with the three groups of fungal hosts. Conclusions Mycoheterotrophic orchids utilizing saprotrophic non-Rhizoctonia fungi as a carbon and nutrient source are clearly more frequent than hitherto assumed. On the basis of this kind of nutrition, orchids can thrive in deeply shaded, light-limiting forest understoreys even without support from ectomycorrhizal fungi. Sub-tropical East Asia appears to be a hotspot for orchids mycorrhizal with saprotrophic non-Rhizoctonia fungi. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Author 2015.

AB  - Aims: This study aimed to determine the influence of tree species on soil microbial community structure. Methods: We conducted a litter and root manipulation and a short-term nitrogen (N) addition experiment in 19-year-old broadleaf Mytilaria laosensis (Hamamelidaceae) and coniferous Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations in subtropical China. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to examine treatment effects on soil microbial community structure. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to determine the relationships between individual PLFAs and soil properties (soil pH, carbon (C) and N concentration and C:N ratio). Results: Soil C:N ratio was significantly greater in M. laosensis (17.9) than in C. lanceolata (16.2). Soil C:N ratio was the key factor affecting the soil microbial community regardless of tree species and the litter, root and N treatments at our study site. The fungal biomarkers, 18:1$\omega$9 and 18:2$\omega$6,9 were significantly and positively related to soil C:N ratio and the abundance of bacterial lipid biomarkers was negatively related to soil C:N ratio. N addition for 8 months did not change the biomass and structure of the microbial community in M. laosensis and C. lanceolata soils. Soil nutrient availability before N addition was an important factor in determining the effect of N fertilization on soil microbial biomass and activity. PLFA analysis showed that root exclusion significantly decreased the abundance of the fungal biomarkers and increased the abundance of the Gram-positive bacteria. Rootless plots had a relatively lower Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria ratio and a higher fungi to bacteria ratio compared to the plots with roots under both M. laosensis and C. lanceolata. The response of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (16:1$\omega$5) to root exclusion was species-specific. Conclusions: These observations suggest that soil C:N ratio was an important factor in influencing soil microbial community structure. Further studies are required to confirm the long-term effect of tree species on soil microbial community structure. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The replacement of mineral soil and capping with salvaged forest floor organic material (FFOM) is a site rehabilitation method applied over belowground installations such as pipelines. Such installations, when placed in mature forest soils, can be expected to disrupt ectomycorrhizal fungal communities when root-associated mycelia and exploratory hyphae are damaged during excavation. Soil fungal communities, bacterial communities, and soil enzymatic repertoires may be variably impacted by different site preparation schemes after disturbance. We compared effects of three rehabilitation schemes on fungal community composition, bacterial community composition, and potential hydrolase activities (N-acetyl-$\beta$-D-glucosaminidase, acid phosphatase, and cellobiohydrolase) at two times (14 days and 5 months post-site preparation) and two sampling depths (FFOM/”upper” versus mineral/”lower” soil). We observed declines in FFOM-associated fungal biomass (ergosterol) and declines in ectomycorrhizal fungi abundance across all site rehabilitation schemes compared to intact control plots. Fungal community composition strongly shifted to saprotroph dominance (i.e. increased Mortierella, and Umbelopsis) in rehabilitated plots at 5 months, while bacterial community composition did not distinguish control plots from rehabilitation plots ones at either sampling time. Bacterial saprotrophs previously associated with mycelial necromass colonization were higher in abundance across multiple site preparation regimens compared to control plots at 14 days. Our results indicate that reductions in ectomycorrhizal fungal abundance were a dominant community property in recently reconstructed soil profiles. Increases in bacteria associated with recently deposited fungal necromass were detectable within days to weeks of implementing site rehabilitation, while fungal necromass colonizers became dominant 5 months post-rehabilitation. Potential hydrolase activities increased in the site preparation regimen where FFOM was mixed into mineral soil, when compared to mineral soil activities in control plots. {\textcopyright} 2019

AB  - Truffle-like fungi are highly diverse yet poorly known in Australia. To assess the species richness, biomass, and community assemblages of truffle-like fungi in different habitats we sampled sporocarps of truffle-like fungi in three eucalypt-dominated forest types (grassy woodland, wet sclerophyll forest, and dry sclerophyll forest) once in summer and once in winter, at two sites (Mount Kaputar and New England) in northern New South Wales, Australia. One hundred and eighteen species in 35 genera were collected; over half (51.7 %) of the species were undescribed. Grassy woodland and wet forest communities had greater species richness and a lower standing crop than dry forest communities. Species richness and standing crop was greater in winter than in summer. Overall, species from the family Russulaceae, and the genera Dermocybe, Descomyces, and Hysterangium were dominant. Community composition varied among forest types and each forest type exhibited a suite of unique and common species, although much variation was unexplained. Variation in community structure was associated with some habitat attributes; at Mount Kaputar, woody plant species richness, canopy cover, litter depth, soil phosphorous, and elevation helped explain the sporocarp communities of different forest types, while at New England, woody plant species richness, rainfall, topographic aspect, soil texture, and soil nitrogen helped explain communities. This work contributes to knowledge of truffle-like fungal diversity, the factors affecting sporocarp distribution across landscapes, and the availability of sporocarps as a food resource for mycophagous mammals. Greater understanding of fungal diversity and mammal-fungal interactions also has important implications for managing forest biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Mushroom Research Foundation.

AB  - Chronic N deposition to forests may induce N saturation and stand decline, leading to reduced ecosystem N retention capacity, triggered by a shift from N limitation of trees to limitation by another nutrient. We conducted a N-15 soil labelling experiment in non-fertilized and P-fertilized plots at two elevations in an N-saturated Mediterranean-fir (Abies pinsapo) forest in southern Spain which shows P limitation symptoms. Root-exclusion was applied to identify the relative contributions of roots (plus mycorrhizal fungi) uptake, and heterotrophic immobilization by free-living microbes, to N retention. Overall N-15 recovery from the litter, 0-15-cm soil and root-uptake components was ca. 35\% higher in P-fertilized than in non-fertilized plots at both elevations. In non-fertilized plots, soil was the biggest sink for added N-15. Phosphorus fertilization increased the competitive ability of tree roots for soil N resulting in equal importance of the autotrophic (roots plus associated mycorhizal fungi) and heterotrophic (free-living microbes) components with respect to total N-15 recovery in P-fertilized plots. Phosphorus addition increased litter and soil N immobilization only if roots had been excluded. By combining in situ fertilization, root-exclusion and isotope labelling we have demonstrated that reduced N retention capacity and dominance of soil microbial over plant immobilization in a N-saturated forest results from a shift from N to P limitation of trees, while alleviation of P limitation makes tree roots and associated mycorrhizal fungi competitive for N against free soil microorganisms.

AB  - Both ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic fungi are fundamental to carbon and nutrient dynamics in forest ecosystems; however, the relative importance of these different fungal functional groups for higher trophic levels of the soil food web is virtually unknown. To explore differences between fungal functional groups and their importance for higher trophic levels, we analysed isotopic composition of nitrogen and carbon in amino acids (AAs) and bulk tissue of leaf litter, fungi and fungal-feeding Diptera larvae. By accounting for isotopic variability of utilized substrates, compound-specific isotope analyses of nitrogen in AAs yielded more realistic results for the trophic position of fungi than bulk isotope analyses, with converging trophic positions of saprotrophic and ECM fungi. Saprotrophic and ECM fungi possessed different AA $\delta$13C signatures separating fungal functional groups and their consumers in fingerprinting approaches, thereby allowing to trace energy fluxes from these basal resources to higher trophic levels. A pronounced isotopic fractionation even in essential/source AAs of fungal-feeding Diptera larvae necessitates further studies on tissue-/compound-specific isotopic differences in fungi and on potential supplementation by gut micro-organisms. The results highlight the potential of compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids to identify and integrate contributions of different fungal functional groups to higher trophic levels in soil food webs.

AB  - The author suggests a new hypothesis on a triggering effect of drought on the decline of forests submitted to acid precipitation. The phase of soil drying produces a flush of decomposition of organic matter, favoured by Al3+, increasing the amount of C and N available for a subsequent nitrification. The first rainfall after a summer drought (FRAD) induces a surge of activity of autotrophic nitrifiers having survived the drying phase. During acidification pushes an U2 stress resulting from rapid O2 consumming nitrification would induce a temporal shift of NH4+ and NO2 oxidation giving within a few days a transient peak of HNO2 accumulation injurious to fine roots and mycorrhizae. {\textcopyright} 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - To determine the dominant processes controlling nitrogen (N) dynamics in soils and increase insights into soil N cycling from nitrogen isotope ($\delta$15N) data, patterns of 15N enrichment in soil profiles were compiled from studies on tropical, temperate, and boreal systems. The maximum 15N enrichment between litter and deeper soil layers varied strongly with mycorrhizal fungal association, averaging 9. 6 ± 0. 4‰ in ectomycorrhizal systems and 4. 6 ± 0. 5‰ in arbuscular mycorrhizal systems. The 15N enrichment varied little with mean annual temperature, precipitation, or nitrification rates. One main factor controlling 15N in soil profiles, fractionation against 15N during N transfer by mycorrhizal fungi to host plants, leads to 15N-depleted plant litter at the soil surface and 15N-enriched nitrogen of fungal origin at depth. The preferential preservation of 15N-enriched compounds during decomposition and stabilization is a second important factor. A third mechanism, N loss during nitrification and denitrification, may account for large 15N enrichments with depth in less N-limited forests and may account for soil profiles where maximum $\delta$15N is at intermediate depths. Mixing among soil horizons should also decrease differences among soil horizons. We suggest that dynamic models of isotope distributions within soil profiles that can incorporate multiple processes could provide additional information about the history of nitrogen movements and transformations at a site. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

AB  - We synthesised results on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes and the accumulation of soil organic C and N under adjacent 50-year-old Norway spruce, Scots pine and silver birch stands growing on similar soils and evaluated the different processes involved. C and N budgets were calculated. Spruce stands had larger stocks of C and N in biomass and soil than birch stands, with pine intermediate. The differences in soil stocks were mainly found in the organic layer, whereas differences in the mineral soil were small. The study showed that there is no simple answer to what is causing the differences in soil C and N stocks, because several processes are interacting. Spruce and pine trees had higher biomass and litter production than birch trees, but total litter inputs showed no significant difference between stands, because the rich ground vegetation under pine and birch contributed with substantial litter inputs, in contrast to the poor ground vegetation under spruce. Decomposition rate (per g of C) was markedly higher under birch than under spruce and pine resulting in lower C and N stocks in the organic layer. This effect was amplified by higher abundance and biomass of earthworms, favoured by higher pH and palatable litter under birch. Earthworm bioturbation probably both increased decomposition rate and damaged the ectomycorrhizal network with negative consequences for the formation of mycorrhizal litter and C storage. In conclusion, the direct effects of spruce, pine and birch litter on C and N pools and fluxes were modified by indirect effects of understorey structure, pH and earthworm responses.

AB  - Soil is the habitat of plant roots and the home of numerous microflora, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and blue-green algae, and a host of animals from unicellular protozoans to small vertebrates. Simple communities of soil organisms, present from the earliest stages of forest soil genesis, become more complex and grow to astronomical numbers in mature forest soils. Here, they are essential for the maintenance and productivity of these soils, which unlike agricultural systems, generally receive less mechanical treatments and chemical inputs. The soil microflora and fauna complement each other in the comminution of litter, mineralization of essential plant nutrients, and conservation of these nutrients within the soil system. Harvesting directly affects these processes through the reduction and redistribution of organic matter, compaction, changes in plant cover, and modification of microclimate, all of which affect the distribution, composition and activity of the soil biological communities. Although most information is available for clearcut forests, the limited data from other systems indicate that severity of impacts of forest harvesting practices generally follow the sequence: clearcuts > shelterwood systems > extended rotation systems. However, all practices generally affect soil organisms over the short term. Changes over the longer-term are less obvious because of gradual recovery of most biological components with canopy closure. Long-term impacts are more difficult to interpret because these are often influenced by natural changes in population dynamics of soil organisms with forest succession, drought, and the invasion of exotic species. Responses are complex, with various groups being affected differently. Even within a taxon, individual species may behave differently. Although the relationships among floral composition, faunal diversity and sustained soil fertility are not always clear, there are indications that a simplified soil biological system will adversely affect nutrient cycling, tree growth, and forest health. Decomposition rate is generally positively correlated with faunal biomass, and a diverse fauna is required for interacting with microorganisms to enhance microbial diversity. Also, feeding on microflora by the fauna concurrently controls certain plant pathogens. Destruction of mycorrhizae, essential for the establishment of coniferous seedlings, can lead to serious reforestation problems. It is therefore prudent to discourage any qualitative or quantitative changes in the soil biota. Concepts in `new forestry' attempt to mitigate against adverse affects of conventional forest harvesting practices on soil organisms by maintaining plant biodiversity, minimizing soil compaction, avoiding extreme microclimatic conditions, providing refugia for re-colonization by the biota, and directly introducing desirable microflora and fauna.

AB  - In this study, two plots in a secondary and another two in planted Pinus densiflora stands were exposed to different forest treatments, and the ectomycorrhizal (EM) biomass and its ergosterol content was measured for a year. The unmanaged plot in the secondary stand had greater EM biomass than those in any other plots. Whereas understory cutting had less effect on EM biomass, litter and humus removal decreased pine EM biomass and its ergosterol content, suggesting that such forest treatment alters EM biomass and its structure. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Mycological Society of Japan and Springer.

AB  - A recent interest in the study of physiological and biochemical processes in the underground organs of woody plants is due, first of all, to the assessment of their contribution to the carbon balance of forest ecosystems. Root respiration provides a significant part of the total СО2 emission from the soil surface. Abies sibirica Ledeb. has a branched, but not deep, root system and prefers a certain soil fertility and moisture. This tree species does not grow on the permafrost grounds unlike Picea obovata Ledeb. and Pinus sylvestris L. Numerous literature sources describe various methods for measuring CO2 in fine roots, from laboratory measurements to calculating the proportion of root respiration in the total СО2 emission from soil. Our study is based on the original data on the respiration of non-cut roots of A. sibirica in the litter with the minimal damage of the object and environment. The aim of this research is to characterize the seasonal and daily dynamics of fine root respiration rate in A. sibirica in the bilberry-sphagnum pine forest in the middle taiga for two growing seasons. Measurements were performed from May to October in 2016 and 2018 during the vegetation periods in the bilberry-sphagnum pine forest in the middle taiga (N 62°17' E 50°40') of the 5th class of bonitet, stand composition was 9Po1Bp+Ps+As, tree age was 106-200 years, with soil as peaty-podzolic-gleyic, sandy loam, underlied by loams (Histic Albic Retisol). Weather conditions, litter temperature and moisture are presented in Table 1. Respiration of fine mycorrhizal roots (less than 2 mm in diameter) was measured in mature trees by infrared gas analyzer “Li 6400” (Li-Cor, USA) and soil camera during different times of the day in a stream of atmospheric air. Statistical data processing was performed using Microsoft Excel 2003, and STATISTICA 10. Average values of fir fine root respiration differed significantly in 2016 and 2018 and were 0.79±0.01 mg СО2 g-1h-1 and 0.58±0.01 mg СО2 g-1h-1 (Student's t-test). In 2016, respiration rate was higher in August and lower in September (See Table 2 and Table 3). In August, an increase in respiration rate was found only at noon and in the afternoon. In July, respiration rate was higher during morning and evening hours. In September, respiration rate was low during all day compared to other months. The lowest values of root СО2 emission were found in September. In 2018, respiration was high in July and low in August-September. The lowest values of СО2 emission were found in the beginning of June. July increase and September decrease in respiration rate occurred evenly in each measurement interval during the day. Thus, in July, we found higher daily fine roots' СО2 emission compared to other months. In 2016, the daily dynamics demonstrated an increase in root respiration during summer afternoons and its decrease during autumn afternoons followed by an evening increase in respiration. In 2018, summer root respiration increased in the noon and then decreased sharply in the afternoon and evening. The opposite trend was observed in September. We found a positive correlation of fir fine root respiration rate and temperature (See Table 4). The direction of moisture influence on root respiration was different. Fine root respiration rate was correlated positively with camera moisture and negatively with soil moisture. In 2018, the dependence was much stronger than in 2016. Therefore, A. sibirica fine root respiration was different during two years of observation in the bilberry-sphagnum spruce forest and correlated positively with the litter temperature, and negatively with the litter moisture. The seasonal dynamics showed an increased СО2 emission in July and August. The daily dynamics of the respiration rate was different during different vegetation periods, but, in general, the respiration rate was lower during the afternoon hours. {\textcopyright} 2020 Tomsk State University.

AB  - Objective: Quercus virginiana (Fagaceae), native to the southeastern United States, is recently introduced to the Yangtze Delta and often planted as landscape and coastal shelter forests. Quercus root tips are often heavily colonized by a phylogenetic diverse group of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which improve nutrient acquisition and stress resistance for host plants. The purpose of this work is thus to reveal the identities of ECM fungi associated with Q. virginiana roots in the new environment. Method: The ectomycorrhizal root samples were collected at four different stages from October 2017 to August 2018 and traditional morphological description, fungal amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing approaches were used to investigate the diversity and structure dynamics of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with Q. virginiana. Result: All the examined ectomycorrhizas showed black, white, yellow, and their intermediate colors (carmine and oyster white) appearances. The presence of mantle structure was observed microscopically. Based on the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) assignment and their relative abundances, the first three colored mycorrhizas corresponded to the fungi belonging to Tomentella, Scleroderma, and Russula, respectively, which showed rich interspecific genetic diversity inferred from phylogenetic analysis. Weighted Pair-Groups Method Average (WPGMA) cluster analysis of the OTU data matrix revealed that fungal compositions of the remaining two colored-mycorrhizas were very similar to those presented in yellow and black-colored mycorrhizas, respectively, indicating the different development stage of the same type of ectomycorrhizas. In addition, a few other ectomycorrhizal taxa including Amanita, Hebeloma, Pisolithus, Lactarius, and Sebacinales were detected with low abundances. The ectomycorrhizal community structure varied obviously in different sampling time. It is mainly shown as follows: Scleroderma dominated in all samples, its abundance was high at the initial stage, and then gradually decreased and subsequently maintained a stable abundance level; On the contrary, Russula had very low proportion in first sampling time, but increased its abundance gradually; Tomentella was not changed remarkably, with one exception was the second sampling time, in which Tomentella was abundant and comparable to Scleroderma. This observation was also consistent with the emergence of epigeous fruiting bodies of Scleroderma and Russula observed in the field. The non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that there were obvious differences in the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities of the root tips samples from four sampling periods of time (stress=0.157). Highest $\alpha$-diversity indices (Chao1, ACE, Shannon, and Simpson) were observed in the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities of pooled samples collected at the second sampling period. Also, the greatest pairwise dissimilarity value occurred between the samples from the first and fourth sampling period of time based on $\beta$-diversity heatmap. Conclusion: The ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with Q. virginiana are mainly composed of Tomentella, Scleroderma and Russula. There are significant changes of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities at different growth stages, which are probably correlated with the changes of soil moisture and temperature. The results also gain the highlights on exploiting ectomycorrhizal fungi for mycobiont-based Q. virginiana cultivation technology. {\textcopyright} 2020, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

AB  - Micorrizical fungi are an importan organisms in forest rhizospere. They are non timber forest products whose sustainable use must have an ecological basis. Pinarization effect and abundance of litter was determined on the percentage of mycorrhizal infection in roots in a pine-oak forest located in Ecatepec hill. The infection rates were 17.7% due to the work developed in a cool, dry season (February). The structures found in pine roots was as hyphae and vesicles. No effect of pinarizaci{\'{o}}n on the percentage of mycorrhizal infection was observed, however the depth of litter showed a statistically significant effect on the variable of infection, which may be due to the presence of litter benefits the soil microbial activity and also humidity and temperature of the litter layer favors the development of mycorrhizal fungi. {\textcopyright} 2019, Universidad de Tarapaca.

AB  - Studies of the ecology of micro-organisms began only recently despite their intrinsic importance - both practical and theoretical - and their central role in forming the niche habitats of macro-organisms. Plant-fungi interactions offer a relevant model for studies of the ecology of micro-organisms interacting with macro-organisms because of their considerable ecological and economic value as well as their high taxonomic and ecological diversity. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and network analysis, we explored some of the drivers of fungal community composition in Corsica, at various scales and in three ecological guilds: ectomycorrhizal, endophytic and saprotrophic fungi. We investigated the effects on fungal communities of disturbance (e.g. fire and treefall), environmental variables (e.g. soil depth), constraints due to interactions with host plants (e.g. taxonomy) and dispersion. Some patterns of community assembly are similar across guilds and may be governed by the same mechanisms. We found wide variations in fungal communities at the micro-regional scale among the guilds studied and between forests with a different history of wildfires. However, the relative importance of assembly processes and the spatial scales at which they occur vary across guilds. In Corsican pine forests, fifteen years after a fire, the diversity of soil fungus is close to the diversity in unburned stands. Despite the absence of effects on diversity, fire produces clear shifts in the composition of soil fungus communities, in particular for saprobic fungi. We discuss the implications of these findings for plant and fungal community ecologists and for managers of natural areas.

AB  - The availability of soil nutrients (especially phosphorus) and soil water strongly infuence mycorrhizal symbiosis in forest ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of litter removal and increased soil moisture availability on the spore density and mycorrhizal colonization of apogeotropic and non-apogeotropic roots of a secondary forest stand in eastern Amazonia. We determined the percentage of mycorrhizal colonization of apogeotropic and non-apogeotropic (0-10 cm soil depth) fine roots (diameter ≤ 2 mm), spore density, glomalin concentration, and soil phosphorus availability. Litter removal did not reduce soil phosphorus availability. The spore density was not afected by litter removal. In general, the variables varied on a seasonal basis, except the mycorrizal colonization of non-apogetropic roots and glomalin concentration, but were not afected by irrigation. Mechanical damage to the apogeotropic root system, inherent to the fortnightly litter removal, may have contributed to decrease mycorrhizal colonization of both apogeotropic and non-apogeotropic roots and, consequently, soil glomalin. Our results suggest that the reduction of soil cover may have negative impact over the fungus-plant symbiosis. {\textcopyright} 2015, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - We assessed the environmental variables associated with fructification, phenology, abundance, frequency and relative productivity of lignicolous and terrestrial wild edible fungi from Nothofagus forests in the Andean-Patagonia region of Argentina. The study was carried out during autumn 2010, 2011 and 2012. The mycorrhizal species Cortinarius magellanicus and C. xiphidipus were associated with a deep litter layer, whereas the saprophytic Lycoperdon sp. showed lower litter depth values. All the terrestrial species developed under high canopy cover (above 75\%). Lignicolous species such as Clitocybula dusenii and Aleurodiscus vitellinus were more frequently observed in open places, whereas Fistulina. antarctica, F. endoxantha and Grifola gargal seem to prefer high canopy cover. Fruiting of F. antarctica was associated with low wood degradation stage, vs. high wood degradation stage in the case of C. dusenii. F. antarctica, Ramaria patagonica, C. magellanicus and A. vitellinus were found to have longer fruiting periods, from mid-March to mid-April. The most productive species in terms of fresh weight were R. patagonica and F. antarctica. The information provided here is critical to establish guidelines for harvesting these species based on their availability, ensuring their sustainable use.

AB  - In boreal and temperate forests fungi play a particularly important role, since most trees form a symbiotic relationship with many species of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, providing them with assimilates in exchange for minerals. Mycorrhiza is considered one of the most significant factors affecting functioning of forest ecosystems, and in particular the processes of carbon cycling and storage. ECM fungi are involved both directly through carbon accumulation in the mycelial system, and indirectly through their influence on tree biomass production and organic matter decomposition. The amount of carbon transferred to ECM fungi usually varies from 10 to 25 or even 50\% of the host's net photosynthesis, thus they are a group of organisms that significantly affect carbon flow into the soil. Most of that carbon is built into the mycelial system and its structures (fungal parts of ECM roots, extramatrical hyphae and rhizomorphs, sporocarps, etc.). Carbon allocation to the underground part of trees, and thus to ECM roots, changes with stand age and stand development phase. The biomass of active ECM roots and mycelium usually reaches its maximum in young stands, in the canopy closure phase; frequently, this is also true for the standing biomass of fruit bodies. A large share of ECM sporocarps in the forest carbon budget and high levels of ECM vegetative mycelium respiration are considered to be among the main pathways for the release of CO2 from forest soil, indicating a significant role of ECM fungi in fast carbon flow via forest ecosystems. On the other hand, dead ECM fine roots and extramatrical mycelia are a very rich and important pool of sequestered carbon in the soil.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the diversity of species that compose the saprotrophic (anamorphic Ascomycota) fungi community in the leaf litter and soil in Celtis tala forest in Magdalena, located in the province of Buenos Aires. Seasonal samples were taken during two years (2004-2005), and fungi were isolated and identified. The relative frequencies of fungi were calculated. To compare the similarity of the fungi composition between different habitats, Sorensen's index of similarity (S') was applied. The frequencies of occurrence of these fungi were recorded and Shannon Weaver index (H') was applied to evaluate fungal diversity. A total of 104 taxa of anamorphic fungi were identified from which 54 were isolated from leaf litter, 58 from soil, and 8 species common for both types of substrate. From the taxa identified, those that had higher frequencies for leaf litter were the less represented in soil and vice versa. Sorensen's index of similarity resulted 0.14, which means that the saprotrophic fungi community that grows in leaf litter of Celtis tala is composed by different species than those that characterized the mycobiota from the soil of the same area. Nevertheless, no significant differences were found in the index of diversity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Sociedad Argentina de Botanica.

AB  - Activity of fungi participating in the dead wood decomposition was studied in the Velk{\'{y}} Polom Nature Reserve, Protected Landscape Area {\v{Z}}elezn{\'{e}} hory. Two game-proof fences of an area of 0.30 ha (570 m alt.) and 0.19 ha (620 m alt.) were used as permanent sample plots. In both the plots, activities were monitored of wood-destroying fungi in 126.82 m 3 dead wood, 104.05 m3 of which were in beech. After conversion to an area, the volume amounts to 258.82 m3 per ha. In the whole reserve, almost 220 species of macromycetes were recorded in the course of a mycological survey. Wood-destroying fungi are the dominant component of mycoflora representing more than 50% identified taxa of in the period under study. The proportion of mycorrhizal fungi amounted to 14%. A series of macromycetes considered to be saprophytes is bound to products of wood decomposition. Fomes fomentarius (L.) Fr., Fomitopsis pinicola (Sowerby) P. Karst., Ustulina deusta (Fr.) Petrak, Hypoxylon fragiforme (Pers.) Kickx, Ganoderma lipsiense (Batsch) Atk. and the genus Armillaria were the predominant species of wood-decaying fungi. As for rare macro-fungi, it is possible to mention Ascotremella faginea (Peck) Seaver, Stropharia albocrenulata (Peck) Kreisel and Tricholomopsis decora (Fr.) Singer.

AB  - Physiological changes of the ectomycorrhizal plants cause that microorganisms of the mycorrhizosphere differ from those of the root free soil and the rhizosphere. Soil microorganisms are capable of producing and decomposing plant growth regulators. Different soil microorganisms produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) especially in the presence of tryptophan. Without this aminoacid less or no auxins are produced. Plants are capable of taking up the microbiologically formed auxins. Microorganisms are also forming and decomposing ethylene. Microbial formation of gibberellins is also known that microorganisms are capable of gibberellins but less is known about microbial decomposition of this phytohormone by soil microorganisms. B-group vitamins are produced by a wide range of microorganisms. These (and especially thiamin and biotin) are often required by ectomycorrhizal fungi. It seems that plant growth substances are not essential for soil or rhizosphere microorganisms.

AB  - The apterygote Protura may be used as very sensitive bioindicators. They are dependant on the vitality of mycorrhiza. Phytophagous soil insects accumulated inorganic substances obtained by food to some extent, and may serve, also, saprophagous soil animals, as accumulative bioindicators, especially of heavy metals. Fluctuations of population density and litter decomposition often reflect serious external events. The drastic decrease of abundance and decomposition in 1981 are correlated mainly with the extraordinary cool and dry weather during the vegetation period of 1980. Spruce Picea abies might also be influenced by these conditions. Fungal pests and contamination (acid rain, etc) might be responsible for the serious forest diseases, especially in some parts of SW Germany. -from English summary

AB  - The amount of calcium in Eucalyptus diversicolor (karri) ecosystems is high in comparison with other eucalypt forest ecosystems in Australia. A large proportion of this calcium is present as crystalline Ca oxalate. Whewellite (CaC2O4{\textperiodcentered}H2O) accumulates in leaf tissue of the over- and understorey species. Up to 70% of the calcium in the leaves of karri is stored as whewellite, the highest concentrations occurring in the oldest leaves. Synthesis of Ca oxalate by karri may be related in part to the high levels of exchangeable soil calcium. Oxalate of plant origin is rapidly metabolized on the forest floor during decomposition of leaf litter. About 70% of the whewellite in fresh karri leaf litter is degraded during the first wet season following leaf fall. However, additional oxalate is formed in the soil and litter layer from microbial production of oxalic acid. These crystals are of the dihydrate calcium salt, weddelite (CaC2CO4{\textperiodcentered} 2H2O). Microbial production of oxalate, particularly by ectomycorrhizal fungi, may be an important mechanism for mobilizing of phosphate from the strongly phosphateadsorbing soils on which these forests grow. {\textcopyright} 1983 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Changes in the climate may have unpredictable effects on belowground carbon processes and thus, the carbon balance of boreal forests. To understand the interactions of these processes in soil and to quantify the potential changes in the carbon cycle, partitioning of forest floor respiration is crucial. For this purpose, we used nine different treatments to separate the sources of forest floor carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in a mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand in southern Finland. To partition the belowground CO2 emissions, we used two different trenching methods: 1) to exclude roots and mycorrhizal fungal mycelia (mesh with 1-mu m pores) and 2) to exclude roots, but not mycorrhizal hyphae (mesh with 50-mu m pores). Additionally, we used 3) a control treatment that included roots and fungal hyphae. To partition the CO2 emissions from the forest floor vegetation, we 1) removed it, 2) left only the dwarf shrubs, or 3) left the vegetation intact. The forest floor CO2 emissions were regularly measured with a flux chamber throughout the growing seasons in 2013-2015. The total forest floor respiration was partitioned into respiration of tree roots (contributing 48\%), heterotrophic soil respiration (30\%) and respiration of ground vegetation other than shrubs (10\%), dwarf shrubs (8\%), and hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi (4\%). Heterotrophic respiration increased in the trenched treatments without ground vegetation over time, due to the so-called `Gadgil effect'. In the absence of tree mots, but when hyphal access was allowed, respiration in the dwarf shrub treatment increased throughout the experiment. This indicated that dwarf shrubs had fungal connections to outside the experimental plots via their ericoid mycorrhiza. At the same time, other ground vegetation, such as mosses, suppressed the dwarf shrub respiration in trenched treatments. Our results show that competition on the forest floor is intense between plant roots and soil microbes.

AB  - In terrestrial ecosystems, mycorrhizal roots play a key role in the cycling of soil carbon (C) and other nutrients. The impact of environmental factors on the mycorrhizal fungal community has been well studied; however, the seasonal variations in the root-associated fungal microbiota affected by environmental changes are less clear. To improve the understanding of how environmental factors shape the fungal microbiota in mycorrhizal roots, seasonal changes in Pinus tabuliformis root-associated fungi were investigated. In the present study, the seasonal dynamics of edaphic properties, soil enzymatic activities, root fungal colonization rates, and root-associated fungal microbiota in P. tabuliformis forests were studied across four seasons during a whole year to reveal their correlations with environmental changes. The results indicate that the soil functions, such as the enzymatic activities related to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) degradation, were varied with the seasonal changes in microclimate factors, resulting in a significant fluctuation of edaphic properties. In addition, the ectomycorrhizal fungal colonization rate in the host pine tree roots increased during warm seasons (summer and autumn), while the fungal colonization rate of dark septate endophyte was declined. Moreover, the present study indicates that the fungal biomass increased in both the pine roots and rhizospheric soils during warm seasons, while the fungal species richness and diversity decreased. While the Basidiomycota and Ascomycota were the two dominant phyla in both root and soil fungal communities, the higher relative abundance of Basidiomycota taxa presented in warm seasons. In addition, the fungal microbial network complexity declined under the higher temperature and humidity conditions. The present study illustrates that the varieties in connectivity between the microbial networks and in functional taxa of root-associated fungal microbiota significantly influence the soil ecosystem functions, especially the N and P cycling.

AB  - In recent years, metabarcoding has become a key tool to describe microbial communities from natural and artificial environments. Thanks to its high throughput nature, metabarcoding efficiently explores microbial biodiversity under different conditions. It can be performed on environmental (e)DNA to describe so-called total microbial community, or from environmental (e)RNA to describe active microbial community. As opposed to total microbial communities, active ones exclude dead or dormant organisms. For what concerns Fungi, which are mostly filamentous microorganisms, the relationship between DNA-based (total) and RNA-based (active) communities is unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the consequences of performing metabarcoding on both soil and wood-extracted eDNA and eRNA to delineate molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) and differentiate fungal communities according to the environment they originate from. DNA and RNA-based communities differed not only in their taxonomic composition, but also in the relative abundances of several functional guilds. From a taxonomic perspective, we showed that several higher taxa are globally more represented in either ``active{''} or ``total{''} microbial communities. We also observed that delineation of MOTUs based on their co-occurrence among DNA and RNA sequences highlighted differences between the studied habitats that were overlooked when all MOTUs were considered, including those identified exclusively by eDNA sequences. We conclude that metabarcoding on eRNA provides original functional information on the specific roles of several taxonomic or functional groups that would not have been revealed using eDNA alone.

AB  - Wildfire affects our planet's biogeochemistry both by burning biomass and by driving changes in ecological communities and landcover. Some plants and ecosystem types are threatened by increasing fire pressure while others respond positively to fire, growing in local and regional abundance when it occurs regularly. However, quantifying total ecosystem response to fire demands consideration of impacts not only on aboveground vegetation, but also on soil microbes like fungi, which influence decomposition and nutrient mineralization. If fire-resistant soil fungal communities co-occur with similarly adapted plants, these above- and belowground ecosystem components should shift and recover in relative synchrony after burning. If not, fire might decouple ecosystem processes governed by these different communities, affecting total functioning. Here, we use a natural experiment to test whether fire-dependent ecosystems host unique, fire-resistant fungal communities. We surveyed burned and unburned areas across two California ecosystem types with differing fire ecologies in the immediate aftermath of a wildfire, finding that the soil fungal communities of fire-dependent oak woodlands differ from those of neighbouring mixed evergreen forests. We discovered furthermore that the latter are more strongly altered compositionally by fire than the former, suggesting that differences in fungal community structure support divergent community responses to fire across ecosystems. Our results thus indicate that fire-dependent ecosystems may host fire-resistant fungal communities.

AB  - Selection of appropriate tree species is an important forest management decision that may affect sequestration of carbon (C) in soil. However, information about tree species effects on soil C stocks at the global scale remains unclear. Here, we quantitatively synthesized 850 observations from field studies that were conducted in a common garden or monoculture plantations to assess how tree species type (broadleaf vs. conifer), mycorrhizal association (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) vs. ectomycorrhizal (ECM)), and N-fixing ability (N-fixing vs. non-N-fixing), directly and indirectly, affect topsoil (with a median depth of 10 cm) C concentration and stock, and how such effects were influenced by environmental factors such as geographical location and climate. We found that (1) tree species type, mycorrhizal association, and N-fixing ability were all important factors affecting soil C, with lower forest floor C stocks under broadleaved (44\%), AM (39\%), or N-fixing (28\%) trees respectively, but higher mineral soil C concentration (11\%, 22\%, and 156\%) and stock (9\%, 10\%, and 6\%) under broadleaved, AM, and N-fixing trees respectively; (2) tree species type, mycorrhizal association, and N-fixing ability affected forest floor C stock and mineral soil C concentration and stock directly or indirectly through impacting soil properties such as microbial biomass C and nitrogen; (3) tree species effects on mineral soil C concentration and stock were mediated by latitude, MAT, MAP, and forest stand age. These results reveal how tree species and their specific traits influence forest floor C stock and mineral soil C concentration and stock at a global scale. Insights into the underlying mechanisms of tree species effects found in our study would be useful to inform tree species selection in forest management or afforestation aiming to sequester more atmospheric C in soil for mitigation of climate change.

AB  - Forest restoration thinning in Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) plantations can alter stand structure and soil abiotic properties, which have the potential to change biotic properties such as wood-inhabiting fungal community structure. Therefore, three thinning treatments (30\%, 41\% and 53\% of the standing biomass removed) and an unthinned control stand were established at stand age 35 to determine the effects on surface and mineral soil wood-inhabiting fungi. Chinese pine, loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) wood stakes were placed horizontally on the soil surface and inserted vertically into the mineral soil and sampled over 3 years. Fungal species were identified using high-throughput amplicon sequencing (HTAS) of DNA barcode regions. Across all wood stake species on the soil surface, operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness averaged 138 OTUs per thinning treatment. Significantly greater OTU richness (p < 0.01) on both surface pine species stakes was observed in the unthinned control as compared to the moderate and heavily thinned plots. In the mineral soil, wood stakes averaged only 91 OTUs, with no clear OTU pattern for thinning treatment or sampling time for richness. However, aspen stakes had significantly lower (p < 0.01) OTU richness than both pine species stakes on the surface and in mineral soil. Although richness was not strongly affected, fungal community composition in the mineral soil was significantly altered by thinning treatments, wood stake species, and sampling time. This study extends our knowledge of the long-term effects of stand thinning on fungal communities' richness and composition.

AB  - The knowledge of tree species dependent turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) is limited, yet required to understand the carbon sequestration function of forest soil. We combined investigations of C-13 and N-15 and its relationship to elemental stoichiometry along soil depth gradients in 35-year old monocultural stands of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), black pine (Pinus nigra), European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and red oak (Quercus rubra) growing on a uniform post-mining soil. We investigated the natural abundance of C-13 and N-15 and the carbon:nitrogen (C:N) and oxygen:carbon (O:C) stoichiometry of litterfall and fine roots as well as SOM in the forest floor and mineral soil. Tree species had a significant effect on SOM delta C-13 and delta N-15 reflecting significantly different signatures of litterfall and root inputs. Throughout the soil profile, delta C-13 and delta N-15 were significantly related to the C:N and O:C ratio which indicates that isotope enrichment with soil depth is linked to the turnover of organic matter (OM). Significantly higher turnover of OM in soils under deciduous tree species depended to 46\% on the quality of litterfall and root inputs (N content, C:N, O:C ratio), and the initial isotopic signatures of litterfall. Hence, SOM composition and turnover also depends on additional-presumably microbial driven-factors. The enrichment of N-15 with soil depth was generally linked to C-13. In soils under pine, however, with limited N and C availability, the enrichment of N-15 was decoupled from C-13. This suggests that transformation pathways depend on litter quality of tree species.

AB  - Woody plant roots can be classified into absorptive roots and transport roots based on root functions, order and traits. While there is an emerging view that living roots actively affect soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition via the rhizosphere priming effect (RPE), the linkages of the RPE with C allocation to absorptive roots (relative to total roots) and their functional traits across soils are virtually unknown. Here, we investigated the RPE by growing a tree species (Chinese fir, Cunninghamia lanceolata) in three isotopically-distinct C-4 soil types with different soil properties such as C/nitrogen (N) ratio and texture, and by growing three tree species (Chinese fir, larch (Larix kaempferi) and ash (Fraxinus mandshurica)) with wide variations in root functional traits in one of the C-4 soils. We classified living roots into absorptive roots (first and second orders) and transport roots (third and higher orders) and then quantified their C allocation (relative to total roots) and morphological and chemical traits associated with economic construction, rhizodeposition and resource acquisition. We found that the RPE of Chinese fir across the three soils decreased with an increase in soil C/N ratio. This result conflicted with the N mining hypothesis and suggests that soil C stabilization mechanisms associated with clay minerals may play an important role. Further, significant differences in the RPE among tree species were largely accounted for by the C allocation to absorptive roots. Moreover, there was a significantly negative relationship between specific surface area of absorptive roots and the specific RPE (per unit biomass of absorptive roots) among tree species, suggesting that absorptive root traits shaping the extent of the rhizosphere may regulate the RPE. Taken together, our results provide evidence that absorptive roots play a predominant role in causing the RPE. These findings present an important step toward improving our capability to predict plant effects on SOC decomposition through linking the RPE to absorptive root functional traits.

AB  - Predicting changes in carbon and nutrient cycles in plantations requires a mechanistic understanding of the effects of stand age on soil quality and microbial communities. Here, we evaluated soil quality by using an integrated soil quality index (SQI) and traced the parallel shifts in fungal community composition using high-throughput sequencing in a chronosequence of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations (stand age of 3, 16, 25, 32, >80 years). Soil properties showed pronounced changes with stand age in the topsoil. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and available phosphorus (AP) were 2.1, 1.9 and 2.2 times higher, respectively, in the oldest stands than in the youngest stands. SQI of the top 5 cm increased logarithmically with stand age. Mycorrhizal fungi initially increased in younger stands, but then they were gradually replaced by saprotrophs in older stands due to larger litterfall. Strong positive correlations between saprotrophic fungi and key soil quality indicators, such as TN, AP and NH4+, confirmed that abundance of decomposers is tightly linked with higher soil quality. Mycorrhizal ordersThelephorales,SebacinalesandRussulalesincreased in abundance and raised the activity of acid phosphatase to mobilise limiting phosphorus from organic matter. Consequently, mycorrhizal fungi are especially relevant in younger stands to acquire nutrients to sustain tree productivity. In developed stands, however, saprotrophic fungi are crucial in recycling nutrients from the litter. Collectively, the increase of topsoil quality during the life cycle of Chinese fir plantations is closely linked with the observed transition of fungal communities from mycorrhizae to saprotrophs.

AB  - The temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition is an important parameter for those seeking accurate projections of SOC dynamics and its feedback on climate change in terrestrial ecosystems. However, howQ(10)responds to N deposition across environmental gradients and the underlying mechanism remain largely unresolved. We conducted a novel incubation experiment with periodically varying temperature based on the of soil origin sites to elucidate the responses ofQ(10)to N addition across China. Our results demonstrated that N addition effects (NAEs) onQ(10)were negatively related to latitude and were strongly site dependent. Bioclimatic, edaphic, and microbial variables together explained 50.1\% of the total variation in NAEs onQ(10), but bioclimate (16.0\%) had the greater explanation than edaphic (11.8\%) and microbial properties (6.3\%). The response of soil exchangeable Ca(2+)to N addition was a predictive power for NAEs onQ(10), contributing 7.2\% relative importance in regulating this variation. Furthermore, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi indicated by Glomeromycota were the best microbial predictor and contributed 10.9\% relative importance in the variation regulating NAEs onQ(10). Overall, our results suggest that increasing N addition will increase the sensitivity of SOC decomposition to global warming and highlight the importance of bioclimate, exchangeable Ca2+, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in predicting the response ofQ(10)to N deposition in natural terrestrial ecosystems. The biogeographic variation in response ofQ(10)to N deposition should be considered in carbon-climate models to decrease the prediction uncertainties of SOC dynamics and its feedback to global warming.

AB  - There is a continuing argument about the benefits of biochar on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, crop growth, yield, and fertility of soil. There is also limited research on the effects of biochar on AM colonization, cucumber yield, and soil fertility improvement. Therefore, this investigation aimed to determine the impact of poultry litter biochar (PLB) on colonization of roots by indigenous AM fungi in agricultural soil and their contribution to cucumber yield, nutrition, and soil fertility improvement. A field trial was conducted to assess the effect of PLB combined with compound poultry manure (CPM) and nitrophos (NP) fertilizer to investigate the response of treatments on nutrient-deficient sandy soils. Plant growth responses to biochar showed better plant growth and yield of cucumber. Application of biochar with and without CPM and NP reduced the negative impact of nutrient deficiency stress on cucumber growth. AM fungal colonization, soil fertility, and cucumber yield were improved with the combined application of biochar, CPM, and NP fertilizer. Post-harvest, soil C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn increased with application of biochar applied with CPM and NP. Biochar application with CPM and NP also increased the percent root colonization of cucumber. Use of biochar with CPM and NP has the potential to improve plant growth, yield, nutrient uptake, and soil fertility. Further studies in various agro-ecological conditions would help utilize this technology in sustainable crop production.

AB  - Recent studies have revealed effects of various tree species on soil physical and chemical properties. However, effects of various tree species on composition and activity of soil microbiota and the relevant controls remain poorly understood. We evaluated the influence of tree species associated with two different mycorrhizal types, ectomycorrhiza (EcM) and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), on growth, biomass and metabolic activity of soil fungal and bacterial communities using common garden tree species experiments throughout Denmark. The soil microbial communities differed between six European tree species as well as between EcM (beech, lime, oak and spruce) and AM (ash and maple) tree species. The EcM tree species had higher fungal biomass, fungal growth and bacterial biomass, while AM species showed higher bacterial growth. The results indicated that microbial community composition and functioning differed between groups of tree species with distinct litter qualities that generate soil C/N ratio and soil pH differences. The mycorrhizal association only partly explained litter quality and soil microbial species differences since lime was more similar to AM tree species. In addition, our results indicated that tree species-mediated soil pH and C/N ratio were the most important variables shaping microbial communities with a positive effect on bacterial and a negative effect on fungal growth rates. The results suggest that tree species-mediated microbial community composition and activity may be important drivers of the different vertical soil C distribution previously observed in AM and EcM tree species.

AB  - Thinning profoundly affects soil microbial communities and carbon (C) cycling through altering soil microclimate, plant growth, C inputs and allocations. However, these effects are uncertain and may change with thinning intensity, recovery stage, forest type, and climate. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis, based on 337 observations from 49 studies, to quantify the responses of soil properties, microbial biomass and community structure, and extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) to thinning. We found that thinning did not change the total microbial biomass, but significantly shifted the soil microbial community structure and EEAs. Thinning stimulated both C-oxidase and C-hydrolase, but decreased the ratio of oligotrophic to copiotrophic microbes (i.e. fungi to bacteria ratio and Gram-positive bacteria to Gram-negative bacteria ratio) in the early recovery stage. In contrast, in the mid recovery stage, thinning enhanced C-oxidase but reduced C-hydrolase, and increased the ratio of oligotrophic to copiotrophic microbes. In the late recovery stage, neither community structure nor EEAs differed significantly between thinned and control stands. Such recovery dynamics reflect shifts of the resource-utilization strategies of microbes that are associated with community reorganization. Besides, the distinct litter quality between coniferous and broadleaf forests explained their different microbial responses. Overall, the current meta-analysis suggested that microbes can adapt the thinning-induced biotic and abiotic changes by adjustment of community structure rather than their biomass. The global patterns of how soil microbial community structure and EEAs respond to thinning deepen the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the thinning impacts on the soil C cycling.

AB  - While growing evidence has shown the shift in terrestrial ecosystems from nitrogen (N) limitation to phosphorous (P) limitation under increasing N deposition, it is poorly understood how plants adapt to this P limitation. Here, we examined which strategies would be adopted by plants for alleviating P deficiency caused by N enrichment from the perspective of aboveground conservation and belowground uptake. To achieve this objective, we conducted a five-year N-addition experiment (0 and 50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) in a 60-year-old larch (Larbc kaempferi) plantation, and measured variables related to ecosystem P status, leaf P resorption, soil exploration by roots and extraradical hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi, and rhizosphere effects on soil P cycling. We found that N addition significantly reduced soil available P concentration and enhanced leaf N:P ratio, indicating the increasing degree of P deficiency under N addition. Leaf P resorption efficiency and proficiency were significantly enhanced by N addition, implying the increase in aboveground P conservation. Moreover, N addition significantly increased root length density and decreased ectomycorrhizal extraradical hypha biomass, suggesting the enhanced role of the root pathway in scavenging soil P. Rhizosphere effects on phosphatase activity were significantly enhanced by N addition, indicating the improved capacity of mining P from organic P forms. Collectively, our findings highlight that the larch could concurrently improve aboveground P conservation and belowground P uptake to alleviate P deficiency induced by N addition, and suggest that adjustments in resource allocation associated with these adaptive strategies could have significant consequences on ecosystem functions.

AB  - Tropical soils are critical terrestrial carbon reservoirs with abundant biodiversity that respond rapidly to environmental change. Globally, the expanding conversion of natural tropical forest to plantations in recent decades, to meet economic demands, has markedly influenced the cycling of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools; however, the mechanisms underlying the changes in SOC dynamics are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the SOC dynamics and soil microbial communities at five adjacent tropical forest sites characterized by different logging and plantation practices over the past few decades on Hainan Island, China, by applying natural abundance radiocarbon (C-14) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. At a > 35-year rubber plantation site and a > 50-year eucalyptus plantation site, an abnormal up-profile decrease in radiocarbon abundance was observed in the upper 30 cm soil layer. This could be indicative of continued soil organic matter decomposition long after forest-plantation conversion, and was consistent with the SOC inventories in the upper 30 cm soil layer at the two sites being significantly lower than those of NF. Both the SOC apparent radiocarbon ages and SOC inventory at a eucalyptus plantation site in which tillage was stopped 20 years ago were similar to those of NF, indicating that a recovery process had occurred. The soil microbial biomass was generally lower at the plantation sites than at the NF site. Both the radiocarbon abundance and SOC inventories in the upper 30 cm soil layer showed positive correlations with the soil microbial biomass, suggesting that microbes may have played a key role in the fate of SOC. This study provided evidence that forest-plantation conversion may facilitate the dissimilation of SOC, and also demonstrated that radiocarbon can serve as a powerful tool for assessing the potential changes of soil carbon dynamics resulting from forest-to-plantation conversion.

AB  - Liming can counteract acidification in forest soils, but the effects on soil C and N pools and fluxes over long periods are less well understood. Replicated plots in an acidic and N-rich 40-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest in SW Sweden (Hasslov) were treated with 0, 3.45 and 8.75 Mg ha(-1)of dolomitic lime (D0, D2 and D3) in 1984. Between 1984 and 2016, soil organic C to 30 cm depth increased by 28 Mg ha(-1)(30\% increase) in D0 and decreased by 9 Mg ha(-1)(9.4\% decrease) in D3. The change in D2 was not significant (+ 2 Mg ha(-1)). Soil N pools changed proportionally to those in soil C pools. The C and N changes occurred almost exclusively in the top organic layer. Non-burrowing earthworms responded positively to liming and stimulated heterotrophic respiration in this layer in both D2 and D3. Burrowing earthworms in D3 further accelerated C and N turnover and loss of soil. The high soil C and N loss at our relatively N-rich site differs from studies of N-poor sites showing no C and N loss. Earthworms need both high pH and N-rich food to reach high abundance and biomass. This can explain why liming of N-rich soils often results in decreasing C and N pools, whereas liming of N-poor soils with few earthworms will not show any change in soil C and N. Extractable nitrate N was always higher in D3 than in D2 and D0. After 6 years (1990), potential nitrification was much higher in D3 (197 kg N ha(-1)) than in D0 (36 kg N ha(-1)), but this difference decreased during the following years, when also the unlimed organic layers showed high nitrification potential. Our experiment finds that high-dose liming of acidic N-rich forest soils produces an initial pulse of soil heterotrophic respiration and increases in earthworm biomass, which together cause long-term declines in soil C and N pools.

AB  - The negative effects of deforestation can potentially be ameliorated through ecological restoration. However, reforestation alone may not reassemble the same ecological communities or functions as primary forests. In part, this failure may be owed to forest ecosystems inherently involving complex interactions among guilds of organisms. Plants, which structure forest food webs, rely on intimate associations with symbiotic microbes such as root-inhabiting mycorrhizal fungi. Here, we leverage a large-scale reforestation project on Hawai'i Island underway for over three decades to assess whether arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities have concurrently been restored. The reference ecosystem for this restoration project is a remnant montane native Hawaiian forest that provides critical habitat for endangered birds. We sampled soils from 12 plots within remnant and restored forest patches and characterized AM fungal communities using high-throughput amplicon sequencing. While some AM fungal community metrics were comparable between remnant and restored forest (e.g. species richness), other key characteristics were not. Specifically, community membership and the identity of AM fungal keystone species differed between the two habitat types, as well as the primary environmental factors influencing community composition. Remnant forest AM fungal communities were strongly associated with soil chemical properties, especially pH, while restored forest communities were influenced by the spatial proximity to remnant forests. We posit that combined, these differences in soil AM fungal communities could be negatively affecting the recruitment of native plant hosts and that future restoration efforts should consider plant-microbe interactions as an important facet of forest health.

AB  - Cistus ladanifer scrublands are widely distributed in the Mediterranean basin and represent an early stage of secondary succession following major disturbances (e.g., fire). This vegetation type often establishes on disturbed and poor soils, thereby improving soil stability in stress-prone environments. Fire prevention treatments in these scrublands are often recommended to decrease the risk of wildfires, but the effect of these treatments on associated soil fungi is not known. We studied the effect of distinct fire prevention treatments on soil fungal communities associated with C. ladanifer scrublands soils. We used Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the ITS1 region on soil samples taken after distinct fire prevention treatments that were performed in 27 plots belonging to a long-term experiment. Recent fire prevention treatments did not affect overall fungal community composition nor fungal diversity; however, when analyzing the community according to the functional guilds, the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal species was significantly lower in burned and 100\% cleared plots, compared with control and 50\% cleared plots. In contrast, site history affected fungal community composition and richness to a greater extent than the fire prevention treatments. Our results show a higher susceptibility of ectomycorrhizal species to recent high-intensity fire prevention treatments, whereas fire prevention treatments of medium intensity may reduce the risk of wildfire and maintain the soil fungal community.

AB  - Increases in global temperatures due to climate change threaten to tip the balance between carbon (C) fluxes, liberating large amounts of C from soils. Evidence of warming-induced increases in CO2 efflux from soils has led to suggestions that this response of soil respiration (R-S) will trigger a positive land C-climate feedback cycle, ultimately warming the Earth further. Currently, there is little consensus about the mechanisms driving the warming-induced R-S response, and there are relatively few studies from ecosystems with large soil C stores. Here, we investigate the impacts of experimental warming on R-S in the C-rich soils of a Tasmanian grassy sedgeland and whether alterations of plant community composition or differences in microbial respiratory potential could contribute to any effects. In situ, warming increased RS on average by 28 \%, and this effect was consistent over time and across plant community composition treatments. In contrast, warming had no impact on microbial respiration in incubation experiments. Plant community composition manipulations did not influence R-S or the R-S response to warming. Processes driving the R-S response in this experiment were, therefore, not due to plant community effects and are more likely due to increases in belowground autotrophic respiration and the supply of labile substrate through rhizodeposition and root exudates. CO2 efflux from this high-C soil increased by more than a quarter in response to warming, suggesting inputs need to increase by at least this amount if soil C stocks are to be maintained. These results indicate the need for comprehensive investigations of both C inputs and losses from C-rich soils if efforts to model net ecosystem C exchange of these crucial, C-dense systems are to be successful.

AB  - Root exudation stimulates microbial decomposition and enhances nutrient availability to plants. It remains difficult to measure and predict this carbon flux in natural conditions, especially for mature woody plants. Based on a known conceptual framework of root functional traits coordination, we proposed that root functional traits may predict root exudation. We measured root exudation and other seven root morphological/chemical/physiological traits for 18 coexisting woody species in a deciduous-evergreen mixed forest in subtropical China. Root exudation, respiration, diameter and nitrogen (N) concentration all exhibited significant phylogenetic signals. We found that root exudation positively correlated with competitive traits (root respiration, N concentration) and negatively with a conservative trait (root tissue density). Furthermore, these relationships were independent of phylogenetic signals. A principal component analysis showed that root exudation and morphological traits loaded on two perpendicular axes. Root exudation is a competitive trait in a multidimensional fine-root functional coordination. The metabolic dimension on which root exudation loaded was relatively independent of the morphological dimension, indicating that increasing nutrient availability by root exudation might be a complementary strategy for plant nutrient acquisition. The positive relationship between root exudation and root respiration and N concentration is a promising approach for the future prediction of root exudation.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of environmental variables on soil fungal communities under different vegetation types in order to advance our understanding of soil fungal community assembly associated with restored vegetation and under different climate conditions. Three vegetation types (no grazing and logging in grasslands and forests, and planted herbs and small shrubs in bare land in the desert) on the Loess Plateau in China were chosen as subjects, and pyrosequencing of the 18S rRNA gene region was used to analyze the changes in the diversity and community composition of soil fungi. Vegetation type had significant effects on soil fungal diversity. The forest and grassland soils had similar fungal diversity levels, which were significantly higher than that of the desert ecosystem. Multiple regression models indicated that total phosphorus in soil and the ratio of soil organic carbon to total nitrogen in soil (C:N) were the best predictors of soil fungal diversity. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the most dominant phyla in all soils, accounting for 83.6 \% of fungal sequences. Dothideomycetes (26.6 \%), Sordariomycetes (18.3 \%), Eurotiomycetes (8.5 \%), Pezizomycetes (12.1 \%) and Dothideomycetes (10.7 \%) were the dominant classes across the three vegetation types. Agaricomycetes and Sordariomycetes were more dominant in forest soils than grasslands and desert soils, while Pezizomycetes were more frequently observed in desert soils. Along an increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP) gradient, relative abundance of the Ascomycota phylum decreased and that of the Basidiomycota increased. Among local environmental factors, MAP, soil pH and soil organic matter were the main factors influencing the soil fungal community composition, explaining 20.9 \%, 15.9 \% and 10.4 \% of the variation in the fungal community, respectively. Considering geographic distance, variation partitioning revealed that geographic distance explained more of the fungal community variation than measured environmental factors. This finding may help to predict the consequences in fungal communities in response to climate change and vegetation restoration in arid areas.

AB  - Production of carbon dioxide, as one of the ultimate products of fungal metabolism, can be used to quantify and measure their metabolic rate under different conditions, thus aiding in finding the optimal substrate and environment for cultivation of wood-destroying fungi. This study is focused on speciesPleurotus ostreatusandGanoderma lucidum,. These species are also cultivated for mycorestoration as well as their medicinal and nutritional value. To quantify their metabolical rate on various substrates (agar medium, wood chips, rye straw), multiple custom-built airtight chambers were equipped with CO(2)probes (GMP 343, Vaisala, Finland) to measure the production of carbon dioxide. The highest values were measured during the primordial production on rye straw substrate, with the average values of 1.09 g CO(2)kg(-1)(substrate) h(-1). These values varied significantly between various substrates, fungal species and development stages.

AB  - Hundreds of Proteaceae species in Australia and South Africa typically grow on phosphorus (P)-impoverished soils, exhibiting a carboxylate-releasing P-mobilizing strategy. In the Southwest Australian Biodiversity Hotspot, twoXylomelum(Proteaceae) species are widely distributed, but restricted within that distribution. We grewXylomelum occidentalein hydroponics at 1 mu M P. Leaves, seeds, rhizosheath and bulk soil were collected in natural habitats. Xylomelum occidentaledid not produce functional cluster roots and occupied soils that are somewhat less P-impoverished than those in typical Proteaceae habitats in the region. Based on measurements of foliar manganese concentrations (a proxy for rhizosphere carboxylate concentrations) and P fractions in bulk and rhizosheath soil, we conclude thatX. occidentaleaccesses organic P, without releasing carboxylates. Solution(31)P-NMR spectroscopy revealed which organic P formsX. occidentaleaccessed. Xylomelum occidentaleuses a strategy that differs fundamentally from that typical in Proteaceae, accessing soil organic P without carboxylates. We surmise that this novel strategy is likely expressed also in co-occurring non-Proteaceae that lack a carboxylate-exuding strategy. These co-occurring species are unlikely to benefit from mycorrhizal associations, because plant-available soil P concentrations are too low. Synthesis. Our findings show the first field evidence of effectively utilizing soil organic P byX. occidentalewithout carboxylate exudation and explain their relatively restricted distribution in an old P-impoverished landscape, contributing to a better understanding of how diverse P-acquisition strategies coexist in a megadiverse ecosystem.

AB  - Despite the enormous size of the organic nitrogen (N) pool contained in mineral subsoils, rates of N cycling and soil exoenzyme activities are rarely measured in soils below 10 or 20 cm depth. Furthermore, assumed relationships between N mineralization rates and the activities of various decomposition exoenzymes are poorly characterized. We measured rates of gross and net N mineralization and nitrification as well as the potential activities of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes at five soil depths (forest floor to 50 cm) in Spodosols at three hardwood forests of varying age (45 and 100 years post-harvest and old growth) at and near the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA. As expected, rates of N cycling and potential enzyme activities per unit soil mass correlated strongly with soil carbon (C) concentration, and these parameters declined exponentially with increasing soil depth. After normalization per unit soil organic matter, N cycling rates and specific enzyme activities generally decreased little with depth within the mineral soil. Gross N mineralization rates correlated with specific activities of those enzymes that hydrolyze cellulose (beta-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase) and N-rich glucosamine polymers (N-acetylglucosaminidase), but not those that degrade protein or more complex C compounds. Hence, gross N cycling appear associated with the N released during microbial N recycling, rather than from decomposition of soil organic matter. Across the three stands, the youngest had a larger ratio of N- to-phosphorus-acquiring enzyme activities, indicating a greater N demand in younger than older forests. For all three stands, mineral soil below 10 cm contributed 30-53\% of total gross and net N cycling per unit area to 50 cm depth. Overall, even though microbial N cycling and enzyme activities per unit soil mass decreased with depth, microbial processes in subsoils contributed substantially to ecosystem-scale gross N fluxes because of the sustained microbial activity per unit soil organic matter at depth and the large size of the organic matter pool in the mineral soil. These results support the inclusion of often-ignored mineral subsoils and microbial N recycling in both ecosystem N budgets and in model simulations, due to their contribution to soil N fluxes and the importance of microbial N dynamics in forest stands.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) deposition is a key factor that affects terrestrial biogeochemical cycles with a growing trend, especially in the southeast region of China, where shortage of available phosphorus (P) is particularly acute and P has become a major factor limiting plant growth and productivity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) establish a mutualistic symbiosis with plants, and play an important role in enhancing plant stress resistance. However, the response of AMF to the combined effects of N deposition and P additions is poorly understood. Thus, in this study, a field experiment was conducted in 10-year Chinese fir forests to estimate the effects of simulated nitrogen (N) deposition (low-N, 30 kg ha(-1) year(-1) and high-N, 60 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) and phosphorus (P) addition treatments (low-P, 20 mg kg(-1) and high-P, 40 mg kg(-1)) on AMF since April 2017, which was reflected in AMF root colonization rates and spore density of rhizosphere soil. Our results showed that N deposition significantly decreased AMF root colonization rates and spore density. In N-free plots, P addition significantly decreased AMF root colonization rates, but did not significantly alter spore density. In low-N plots, colonization rates significantly decreased under low P addition, but significantly increased under high P addition, and spore density exhibited a significant decline under high P additions. In high-N plots, colonization rates and spore density significantly increased under P additions. Interactive effects of simulated N deposition and P addition on both colonization rates and spore density were significant. Moderate N deposition or P addition can weaken the symbiotic relationship between plants and AMF, significantly reducing AMF colonization rates and inhibiting spore production. However, a moderate addition of P greatly enhances spore yield. In the case of interactive effects, the AMF colonization rates and spore density are affected by the relative content of N and P in the soil.

AB  - Fungi are key players in vital ecosystem services, spanning carbon cycling, decomposition, symbiotic associations with cultivated and wild plants and pathogenicity. The high importance of fungi in ecosystem processes contrasts with the incompleteness of our understanding of the patterns of fungal biogeography and the environmental factors that drive those patterns. To reduce this gap of knowledge, we collected and validated data published on the composition of soil fungal communities in terrestrial environments including soil and plant-associated habitats and made them publicly accessible through a user interface at https://globalfungi.com. The GlobalFungi database contains over 600 million observations of fungal sequences across>17 000 samples with geographical locations and additional metadata contained in 178 original studies with millions of unique nucleotide sequences (sequence variants) of the fungal internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2 representing fungal species and genera. The study represents the most comprehensive atlas of global fungal distribution, and it is framed in such a way that third-party data addition is possible.

AB  - Biological activities determine quality, sustainability, health, and fertility of soils. The purpose of this study was to evaluate chemical and biological characteristics of soils from Ecuadorian highlands subjected to different management practices, as well as the density and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Soils from naturalized grasslands and other previously cropped plots withZea maysandSolanum tuberosumwere analyzed in laboratory for soil biochemical properties, enzyme activity, and AMF colonization to determine the effect of the soil management over its quality. The characterization of AMF propagules associated to spontaneously colonizing plants in the above soils was also performed. Soil previously cropped withS. tuberosumshowed the highest glomalin content; at the same time, naturalized grassland andZ. mayscropped soils showed higher hyphal length. The acid phosphatase activity was higher in naturalized grasslands andZ. mayscropped soils compared with that in theS. tuberosumcropped soils. Moreover, the highest AMF colonization rates and spore number were found in different spontaneous plant species growing in the naturalized grasslands. This study represents the first characterization of AMF propagules of different cropped and naturalized grassland soils, and also is one of the first reports about changes on biochemical and microbial activities occurring in Andean soils from the highlands of Ecuador, undergoing determinant soil management activities.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) produce contrasting plant-soil feedbacks, but how these feedbacks are constrained by lithology is poorly understood. We investigated the hypothesis that lithological drivers of soil fertility filter plant resource economic strategies in ways that influence the relative fitness of trees with AMF or EMF symbioses in a Bornean rain forest containing species with both mycorrhizal strategies. Using forest inventory data on 1245 tree species, we found that although AMF-hosting trees had greater relative dominance on all soil types, with declining lithological soil fertility EMF-hosting trees became more dominant. Data on 13 leaf traits and wood density for a total of 150 species showed that variation was almost always associated with soil type, whereas for six leaf traits (structural properties; carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus ratios, nitrogen isotopes), variation was also associated with mycorrhizal strategy. EMF-hosting species had slower leaf economics than AMF-hosts, demonstrating the central role of mycorrhizal symbiosis in plant resource economies. At the global scale, climate has been shown to shape forest mycorrhizal composition, but here we show that in communities it depends on soil lithology, suggesting scale-dependent abiotic factors influence feedbacks underlying the relative fitness of different mycorrhizal strategies.

AB  - Fungi are a key component of tropical biodiversity. However, due to their inconspicuous and largely subterranean nature, they are usually neglected in biodiversity inventories. The goal of this study was to identify the key determinants of fungal richness, community composition, and turnover in tropical rainforests. We tested specifically for the effect of soil properties, habitat, and locality in Amazonia. For these analyses, we used high-throughput sequencing data of short and long reads of fungal DNA present in soil and organic litter samples, combining existing and novel genomic data. Habitat type (phytophysiognomy) emerges as the strongest factor explaining fungal community composition. Naturally open areas-campinas-are the richest habitat overall. Soil properties have different effects depending on the soil layer (litter or mineral soil) and the choice of genetic marker. We suggest that campinas could be a neglected hotspot of fungal diversity. An underlying cause for their rich diversity may be the overall low soil fertility, which increases the reliance on biotic interactions essential for nutrient absorption in these environments, notably ectomycorrhizal fungi-plant associations. Our results highlight the advantages of using both short and long DNA reads produced through high-throughput sequencing to characterize fungal diversity. While short reads can suffice for diversity and community comparison, long reads add taxonomic precision and have the potential to reveal population diversity.

AB  - Fire is a major disturbance linked to the evolutionary history and climate of Mediterranean ecosystems, where the vegetation has evolved fire-adaptive traits (e.g., serotiny in pines). In Mediterranean forests, mutualistic feedbacks between trees and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, essential for ecosystem dynamics, might be shaped by recurrent fires. We tested how the structure and function of ECM fungal communities ofPinus pinasterandPinus halepensisvary among populations subjected to high and low fire recurrence in Mediterranean ecosystems, and analysed the relative contribution of environmental (climate, soil properties) and tree-mediated (serotiny) factors. For both pines, local and regional ECM fungal diversity were lower in areas of high than low fire recurrence, although certain fungal species were favoured in the former. A general decline of ECM root-tip enzymatic activity forP. pinasterwas associated with high fire recurrence, but not forP. halepensis. Fire recurrence and fire-related factors such as climate, soil properties or tree phenotype explained these results. In addition to the main influence of climate, the tree fire-adaptive trait serotiny recovered a great portion of the variation in structure and function of ECM fungal communities associated with fire recurrence. Edaphic conditions (especially pH, tightly linked to bedrock type) were an important driver shaping ECM fungal communities, but mainly at the local scale and probably independently of the fire recurrence. Our results show that ECM fungal community shifts are associated with fire recurrence in fire-prone dry Mediterranean forests, and reveal complex feedbacks among trees, mutualistic fungi and the surrounding environment in these ecosystems.

AB  - In temperate and boreal forests, competition for soil resources between free-living saprotrophs and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi has been suggested to restrict saprotrophic fungal dominance to the most superficial organic soil horizons in forests dominated by EcM trees. By contrast, lower niche overlap with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi could allow fungal saprotrophs to maintain this dominance into deeper soil horizons in AM-dominated forests. Here we used a natural gradient of adjacent forest patches that were dominated by either AM or EcM trees, or a mixture of both to determine how fungal communities characterized with high-throughput amplicon sequencing change across organic and mineral soil horizons. We found a general shift from saprotrophic to mycorrhizal fungal dominance with increasing soil depth in all forest mycorrhizal types, especially in organic horizons. Vertical changes in soil chemistry, including pH, organic matter, exchangeable cations, and extractable phosphorus, coincided with shifts in fungal community composition. Although fungal communities and soil chemistry differed among adjacent forest mycorrhizal types, variations were stronger within a given soil profile, pointing to the importance of considering horizons when characterizing soil fungal communities. Our results also suggest that in temperate forests, vertical shifts from saprotrophic to mycorrhizal fungi within organic and mineral horizons occur similarly in both ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal forests.

AB  - Tropical montane cloud forests contain a large abundance and diversity of canopy epiphytes, which depend on canopy soil to retain water and nutrients. We lack an in depth understanding of how these soils contribute to ecosystem processes and soil diversity and how sensitive they may be to projected climate change. We compared canopy and ground soils in Monteverde, Costa Rica, to determine how these two soil types differ in their extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) and fungal communities. Samples were also collected along two elevation gradients to reveal if canopy soils differed in how EEA and fungal communities responded to elevation compared to ground soils. We found that canopy soils had higher EEA than ground soils. Fungal communities were less diverse and differed significantly between the two soil types. These differences were associated with higher relative abundances of yeasts and endophytes in canopy soils. The relative abundances of free-living filamentous fungi and yeasts shifted more dramatically with elevation in canopy soils compared to ground soils. Our study suggests that canopy soils may be a reservoir for endophytes. Epiphytes may invest in symbionts that promote stress tolerance over mycorrhizal fungi whose high resource demands are costly and less beneficial. Overall, soils harbor distinct fungal communities that may be altered under projected climate change.

AB  - Despite the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in temperate forests, knowledge concerning their diversity and interactions with plants is still insufficient. Therefore, we studied the impact of overstorey species identity on AMF abundance and species richness and composition in relation to herbaceous plant cover and soil chemical properties. The effects of 14 tree species grown for 48 years in monospecific plots in the Siemianice Experimental Forest (western Poland) were compared, including the following groupings: deciduous vs coniferous; native to Poland/Europe vs alien; forming vs not forming arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM). Coniferous tree plots were characterised by lower pH values, plots with deciduous trees by higher concentrations of total Ca and exchangeable forms of Ca, K and Mg. AMF abundance in soils and roots increased along with increasing soil alkalinity and macronutrient levels. Concentrations of the PLFA 16:omega 5 AMF hyphal biomass marker were higher in the soils of deciduous and AM-type tree species than those of coniferous and non-AM types. In addition, concentrations of the NLFA 16:16 omega 5 AMF spore biomass marker were higher in the soils of deciduous tree species. No significant differences were found between groups of native and alien tree species. AMF spore and species numbers were low in comparison to other unforested ecosystems, averaging 77.5 and 1.2 per 50 g of soils, respectively. The presence of 8 AMF species, both widespread (e.g. Funneliformis constrictus) and rare (Acaulospora cavernata) was revealed. Significant divergence in AMF species composition was noted between plots of deciduous and coniferous species. Our study showed that tree species identity, considered as a single factor, has only a slight impact on determining AMF community characteristics. The disparity between AMF community characteristics results from the effects of several factors, as pH and element concentrations in soils, acting within tree species groups.

AB  - Increasing nitrogen (N) deposition has seriously harmed the structure and function of ecosystems throughout the world and this problem has been increasing. How N deposition affects soil faunal communities is poorly understood, compared to plant and microbial communities. Canopy and understory N additions of 25 and 50 kg ha(-1) year(-1) were employed to determine whether the effects of N addition on the soil fauna differ between N released to the canopy or to the understory. Specifically, we examined how the soil fauna survives when N additions produce desynchronized and complex impacts on the soil, microbes and litter quantity under mature subtropical forest ecosystems. Our results showed that no significant differences were observed between the soil faunal communities receiving canopy and understory N additions. This is consistent with our observation that the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in the soil did not significantly differ under the two different methods of applying N. There were no observed effects on the litter quantity, soil microbial Phospholipid Fatty Acids or soil physical-chemical properties; therefore, it is not surprising that N treatments for 4 years did not significantly alter the community structure of soil fauna under the mature subtropical forest sites. However, the shifts in seasonal differences in the microbial communities under the N treatments had a positive effect on soil microbial development compared to control, which might also produce a time-delay influence on the relative development of the soil fauna under mature subtropical forest in the future. Further dynamic monitoring is needed to illustrate the possible effects and mechanisms by which increasing N deposition may alter soil faunal development in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Eukaryote-associated microbiomes vary across host taxa and environments but the key factors underlying their diversity and structure in fungi are still poorly understood. Here we determined the structure of bacterial communities in fungal fruitbodies in relation to the main chemical characteristics in ectomycorrhizal (EcM) and saprotrophic (SAP) mushrooms as well as in the surrounding soil. Our analyses revealed significant differences in the structure of endofungal bacterial communities across fungal phylogenetic groups and to a lesser extent across fungal guilds. These variations could be partly ascribed to differences in fruitbody chemistry, particularly the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and pH. Fungal fruitbodies appear to represent nutrient-rich islands that derive their microbiome largely from the underlying continuous soil environment, with a larger overlap of operational taxonomic units observed between SAP fruitbodies and the surrounding soil, compared with EcM fungi. In addition, bacterial taxa involved in the decomposition of organic material were relatively more abundant in SAP fruitbodies, whereas those involved in release of minerals were relatively more enriched in EcM fruitbodies. Such contrasts in patterns and underlying processes of the microbiome structure between SAP and EcM fungi provide further evidence that bacteria can support the functional roles of these fungi in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Effects of natural forest conversion (NFC) on soil nutrient turnover are substantially mediated by soil microbial extracellular hydrolytic enzymatic activities (Hy-EEAs) and oxidative enzymatic activities (Ox-EEAs). Yet it remains largely unknown the indicative links between soil Hy- and Ox-EEAs and soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supplies based on economic theories of microbial metabolism under NFC. Here we used a meta-analysis approach to synthesize the responses of the soil C-, N-, P-degrading Hy-EEAs and Ox-EEAs, soil microbial biomass, soil organic C, total N. P and available P parameters to natural forest conversion from 51 peer-reviewed studies. Our results showed that NFC notably decreased soil Hy-EEAs but statistically insignificant reduction of soil Ox-EEAs. The changes of soil Hy- and Ox-EEAs were significantly and positively associated with soil organic C, available P as well as microbial biomass C and N but significantly and negatively correlated with soil pH, whereas the changes of soil C/N impacted on soil Ox-EEAs remarkably but not for soil Hy-EEAs. The depletion of soil organic carbon stimulated soil microbial secretion of Hy- and Ox-EEAs. The soil total N scarcity only provoked soil microbial Hy-EEAs rather than Ox-EEAs. The soil total P dearth quickened the soil Ox-EEAs, however, the plenitude of soil available P suppressed soil Hy- and Ox-EEAs. Moreover, the eco-enzymatic stoichiometry of soil Hy-EEAs indicated that soil N and P nutrient limitation after NEC restricted soil microbial N- and P-acquiring enzymes secretion, which ultimately reduced resources availability for C acquisition. Altogether, the distinct responses of soil Hy- and Ox-EEAs depended on substrate availability peculiarly for soil N and P gains of microorganisms for further enzymatic ability on soil C decomposition and highlighted the abundant or absent supply of soil N and P for positive or negative enzymatic activities on metabolic requirement of soil edaphons.

AB  - The land-use change is a major determinant influencing ecosystem carbon (C) patterns and nutrient cycling in subalpine forests in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau. While some results have been obtained in relation to the influence of land-use change on aboveground components, less is known about the belowground microbial communities and related processes. We assessed the structure and function of soil microbial communities following land-use change from old-growth forest (OF) to secondary forest (SF), plantation forest (PF), and grassland (GL) in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau, China. Phospholipid fatty acid profiles and enzyme activity analysis were used to determine the composition and activities of microbial communities, respectively. Significant differences in physicochemical characteristics, microbial communities, and extracellular enzyme activities in soils under different land uses were observed in this study. pH and total nitrogen (TN) in OF and SF were significantly higher than in GL. PF showed the highest soil organic C (SOC), and significantly higher than in GL. Total phosphorus (TP) and C/N ratio in PF were significantly higher than the other land-use types. OF and PF had significantly higher anaerobic bacteria than in GL. The actinobacteria in SF was significantly higher than in PF. The saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal (SEM) fungi was significantly lower in GL than the other land-use types. Total microbial biomass and beta-glucosidase activities were significantly higher in OF and SF than in GL. GL had significantly higher polyphenoloxidase activities than in OF and PF. Anaerobic bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and SEM fungi were positively correlated with SOC and TP, Gram+ bacteria were correlated with C/P and N/P ratio. N-acetylglucosaminidase activity was negatively correlated with anaerobic bacteria, while polyphenoloxidase activity was positively related to actinobacteria. Furthermore, redundancy analysis revealed that the microbial community composition was primarily regulated by TN and pH. This suggested that altered land-use type initiated changes in the physicochemical characteristics of the soils, which affected the composition of microbial communities and microbial enzyme activities related to nutrient cycling in this area. This provides a scientific basis for the influence mechanism of land use on composition and function of microbial communities, as well as the rational utilization and management of land resources.

AB  - The effects of leaf litter on moisture content and fungal decay development in above-ground wood specimens were assessed. Untreated southern pine specimens were exposed with or without leaf litter contact. Two types of leaf litter were evaluated; aged (decomposed) and young (early stages of decomposition). The moisture content of specimens was monitored, and specimens were periodically removed for visual evaluation of decay development. In addition, amplicon-based sequencing analysis of specimens and associated leaf litter was conducted at two time points. Contact with either type of leaf litter resulted in consistently higher moisture contents than those not in contact with leaf litter. Visually, evident decay developed most rapidly in specimens in contact with the aged leaf litter. Analysis of amplicon-based sequencing revealed that leaf litter contributes a significant amount of the available wood decay fungal community with similar communities found in the litter exposed wood and litter itself, but dissimilar community profiles from unexposed wood. Dominant species and guild composition shifted over time, beginning initially with more leaf saprophytes (ascomycetes) and over time shifting to more wood rotting fungi (basidiomycetes). These results highlight the importance of the contributions of leaf litter to fungal colonization and subsequent decay hazard for above-ground wood.

AB  - Truffles contribute both directly and indirectly to important dynamics in the soil web, being involved in a large number of ecological functions that are crucial for terrestrial ecosystems. Despite this, the interrelationships between true truffles, i.e. hypogeous ectomycorrhizal fungi producing valuable fruiting bodies, and other elements of the soil system are largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to shed new light on whether and how much Tuber aestivum affects soil microbial activities (evaluated as enzyme activities), abundance (assayed as soil DNA content) and bacterial genetic diversity along with soil chemical properties. We compared chemical and biological variables inside and outside britles (i.e. areas inhabited by truffles with scarce vegetation cover around host plants) in two seasons, namely spring and summer, using both a linear mixed model and a multivariate two-block partial least squares approach. The areas with truffle presence had higher pH but lower organic carbon and nitrogen content. Similarly, all enzyme activities were lower inside the brule than outside, with the exception of peroxidase. A soil quality index (i.e. AI3) based on three enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase, acid phosphomonoesterase and urease) indicated a reduction in soil quality inside the brule. Overall, soil DNA content responded to an interaction of truffle presence/absence and season, while bacterial genetic diversity indexes were higher in spring. Despite the observational nature of this study, results point out that T. aestivum can be considered a key species in the soil where it is present as it was associated with changes in chemistry as well as microbial activity that were generally more conspicuous than mere seasonal effects, although the causative nature of these associations still needs to be confirmed.

AB  - Stump removal is a common forest management practice used to reduce the mortality of trees affected by the fungal pathogen-mediated root disease, Armillaria root rot, but the impact of stumping on soil fungal community structure is not well understood. This study analyzed the long-term impact of stumping and tree species composition on the abundance, diversity and taxonomic composition of soil fungal communities using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) marker-based DNA metabarcoding in a 48-year-old trial at Skimikin, British Columbia. A total of 108 samples were collected from FH (fermented and humus layers), and soil mineral horizons (A and B) from stumped and unstumped plots of six tree species treatments (pure stands and admixtures of Douglas-fir, western red-cedar and paper birch). Fungal alpha-diversity in the A horizon significantly increased with stumping regardless of tree species composition, while beta-diversity was significantly affected by stumping in all the horizons. We also observed that the relative abundance of the saprotrophic fungal community declined while that of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community increased with stumping. In conclusion, increase in ectomycorrhizal fungal associations, which are positively associated with tree productivity, suggests that stumping can be considered a good management practice for mitigating root disease and promoting tree regeneration.

AB  - Insect herbivory can have important consequences for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite a growing recognition of the role of herbivores in above-ground-below-ground interactions, our current understanding is mainly restricted to studies of vertebrates in grassland and tundra ecosystems, while ecosystems with tree-like canopies (termed forests below) and invertebrates remain understudied. Here, we assess the current state of knowledge of one key aspect of plant-herbivore interactions by conducting a meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed literature on the below-ground consequences of above-ground insect herbivory in forest ecosystems. Main results are reported as aggregated relative effect sizes (Cohen's d). We find that above-ground insect herbivory reduced below-ground carbon (C) allocation by plants to roots (-0.56) and root exudation (-0.85), causing shifts in root-symbiont communities, for example, a decrease (-0.67) in the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Microbial decomposer abundances showed no significant responses, while soil faunal abundances increased (0.50). C and nitrogen (N) mineralization rates (C: 0.48, N: 0.48) along with nutrient leaching (C: 0.30, N: 0.77) increased, with a stronger response to outbreak relative to background insect densities. The negative responses increased in strength in colder and dryer biomes while positive responses were reinforced in warmer and wetter biomes, thus extending previously shown effects for vertebrate herbivores to also include insect herbivory. The positive response by soil fauna to insect herbivory was the notable exception. This may be associated with the limited physical soil disturbance caused by insects compared to ungulates. Furthermore, we identified an under-representation in the literature of large areas of boreal and tropical biomes calling for research priorities to fill these knowledge gaps. We present three recommendations for future research: addressing (a) biological drivers of biogeochemistry and response pathways, (b) knowledge gap from boreal and tropical forests, and (c) heterogeneity of herbivore disturbances. Synthesis. Insect herbivores significantly accelerate soil C and N cycling during outbreaks in forest ecosystems, but we lack knowledge on the underlying biological drivers. Overall, below-ground responses to insect herbivory are similar to vertebrate herbivory responses, which may simplify implementing herbivory effects into ecosystem models. Nonetheless, we identify a few important differences and general knowledge gaps on which we base recommendations for future research.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability strongly affects carbon (C) cycling and storage in terrestrial ecosystems. Nutrient addition can increase C inputs into soil via increased above- and belowground plant productivity, but at the same time can accelerate organic matter decomposition in the soil. The mechanisms underlying these effects on soil organic C (SOC) dynamics remain unclear, especially in nutrient-limited alpine ecosystems that have been subjected to increasing N and P availability in recent decades. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms underlying SOC decomposition and stabilization in an alpine grassland soil after four years of N and P additions. The soil aggregate size distribution, microbial community structure (lipid biomarkers), microbial C use efficiency (CUE) and microbial necromass composition (amino sugar biomarkers) were analyzed. Nutrient addition increased dominance of fast-growing bacteria (copiotrophs), while P addition alone intensified the competitive interactions between arbuscular mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi. These changes led to decreases in the microbial CUE of glucose by 1.6-3.5\% and of vanillin by 8.5\%, and therefore, reduced SOC content in the topsoil. The total microbial necromass remained unaffected by nutrient addition, but the contribution of fungal necromass to SOC increased. The increased abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and fungal necromass under elevated N availability raised the mass proportion of soil macroaggregates (>250 mu m) by 16.5-20.3\%. Therefore, fungi were highly involved in macroaggregation following N addition, and so, moderated the SOC losses through enhanced physical protection. Overall, the complex interactions between microbial physiology (CUE), necromass composition (amino sugars) and physical protection (macroaggregation) in mediating SOC dynamics in response to nutrient enrichment were disentangled to better predict the capability of alpine grassland soils to act as a C sink or source under global change.

AB  - Coffea arabica is a highly traded commodity worldwide, and its plantations are habitat to a wide range of organisms. Coffee farmers are shifting away from traditional shade coffee farms in favor of sun-intensive, higher yield farms, which can impact local biodiversity. Using plant-associated microorganisms in biofertilizers, particularly fungi collected from local forests, to increase crop yields has gained traction among coffee producers. However, the taxonomic and spatial distribution of many fungi in coffee soil, nearby forests and biofertilizers is unknown. We collected soil samples from a sun coffee system, shade coffee system, and nearby forest from Izalco, Sonsonate, El Salvador. At each coffee system, we collected soil from the surface (upper) and 10 cm below the surface (lower), and from the coffee plant drip line (drip line) and the walkway between two plants (walkway). Forest soils were collected from the surface only. We used ITS metabarcoding to characterize fungal communities in soil and in the biofertilizer (applied in both coffee systems), and assigned fungal taxa to functional guilds using FUNGuild. In the sun and shade coffee systems, we found that drip line soil had higher richness in pathotrophs, symbiotrophs, and saprotrophs than walkway soil, suggesting that fungi select for microhabitats closer to coffee plants. Upper and lower soil depths did not differ in fungal richness or composition, which may reflect the shallow root system of Coffea arabica. Soil from shade, sun, and forest had similar numbers of fungal taxa, but differed dramatically in community composition, indicating that local habitat differences drive fungal species sorting among systems. Yet, some fungal taxa were shared among systems, including seven fungal taxa present in the biofertilizer. Understanding the distribution of coffee soil mycobiomes can be used to inform sustainable, ecologically friendly farming practices and identify candidate plant-growth promoting fungi for future studies.

AB  - Soil fungi are ecologically important as decomposers, pathogens, and symbionts in nature. Understanding their biogeographic patterns and driving forces is pivotal to predict alterations arising from environmental changes in ecosystem. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an essential resource for soil fungi; however, the role of its quality in structuring fungal community patterns remains elusive. Here using Illumina MiSeq sequencing, we characterized total fungi and their functional groups in 45 soil samples collected from a 1500-km sampling transect through semi-arid regions in northern China, which are currently suffering great pressure from climate change. Total fungi and their functional groups were all observed to exhibit significant biogeographic patterns which were primarily driven by environmental variables. DOM quality was the best and consistent predictor of diversity of both total fungi and functional groups. Specifically, plant-derived DOM was associated with greater diversity relative to microbe-dominated origins. In addition, fungal diversity linearly increased with increases in degree of humification in DOM. Similarly, among all measured environmental variables, DOM quality had the strongest effects on the community composition of total fungi and functional groups. Together, our work contributes to the factors underlying fungal biogeographic patterns and adds detail to the importance of DOM quality in structuring fungal communities.

AB  - Biogenic volatile organic compounds (bVOCs) play important roles in ecological interactions and Earth system processes, yet the biological and physical processes that drive soil bVOC exchanges remain poorly understood. In temperate forests, nearly all tree species associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Given well-established differences in soil biogeochemistry between AM-dominated and ECM-dominated stands, we hypothesized that bVOC exchanges with the atmosphere would differ between soils from the two stand types. We measured bVOC fluxes at the soil-atmosphere interface in plots dominated by AM- and ECM-associated trees in a deciduous forest in south-central Indiana, USA during the early and late vegetative growing season. Soils in both AM- and ECM-dominated plots were a net bVOC sink following leaf-out and were a greater bVOC sink or smaller source at warmer soil temperatures (T-s). The flux of different bVOCs from ECM plots was often related to soil water content in addition to T-s. Methanol dominated total bVOC fluxes, and ECM soils demonstrated greater uptake relative to AM-dominated plots, on the order of 170 nmol m(-2) hr(-1) during the early growing season. Our results demonstrate the importance of soil dynamics characterized by mycorrhizal associations to bVOC dynamics in forested ecosystems and emphasize the need to study bidirectional soil bVOC uptake and emission processes. Plain Language Summary Plants and soils emit and absorb complex carbon-containing molecules in ways that remain poorly understood. These molecules-called ``biogenic volatile organic compounds,{''} or bVOCs-mediate ecological interactions, including plant defense, and also impact atmospheric chemistry, including aerosol formation. We are becoming more aware of the importance of ``mycorrhizal associations{'' as indicators of biogeochemical variation in forests. Tree species that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi typically have fast-decaying leaf litters and faster nutrient cycling relative to tree species that associate with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which generally have slow-decaying leaf litters and slower nutrient cycling. As such, we hypothesized that forest plots dominated arbuscular mycorrhizal- versus ECM-associated trees would differ in their bVOC emissions. We measured soil bVOC flux in a deciduous forest in Indiana, USA, and noted that soils that were dominated by ECM fungi had greater bVOC uptake, especially when soils were warmer. bVOC uptake in soils dominated by ECM fungi was also sensitive to soil moisture. With this new knowledge, we can create improved models of bVOC fluxes at the ecosystem scale to gain a richer understanding of how soil characteristics impact ecosystem processes and atmospheric chemistry.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF) are involved in soil nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. These fungi can promote the uptake of nutrients (e.g., nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) and water by host plants, as well as facilitate host plant growth and resistance to stresses and diseases, thereby maintaining the aboveground primary productivity of forest ecosystems. Moreover, EcMF can acquire the carbon (C) sources needed for their growth from the host plants. The nutrient regulation mechanisms of EcMF mainly include the decay of soil organic matter via enzymatic degradation, nonenzymatic mechanism (Fenton chemistry), and priming effects, which in turn promote C and N cycling. At the same time, EcMF can secrete organic acids and phosphatases to improve the availability of soil P, or increase mycelium inputs to facilitate plant acquisition of P. The spatiotemporal distribution of EcMF is influenced by a combination of historical factors and contemporary environmental factors. The community of EcMF is associated with various factors, such as climate change, soil conditions, and host distribution. Under global climate change, investigating the relationships between the nutrient cycling functions of EcMF communities and their distribution patterns under various spatiotemporal scales is conducive to more accurate assessments of the ecological effects of EcMF on the sustainable development of forest.

AB  - Thinning is an important silvicultural practice for improving the productivity and stability of plantations, but how thinning influences saprotrophic and mycorrhizal microbes and its ecosystem consequence are unclear. Here we conducted a thinning experiment with four treatments (quartic thinning with low-intensity, LT4; triple thinning with medium-intensity, MT3; twice thinning with high-intensity, HT2; and control) in a 60-year-old Korean larch (Larix olgensis) plantation in northeastern China. Our objective was to examine the thinning-induced changes in the community compositions of fungi, ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi, saprotrophic fungi, and bacteria using a high-throughput sequencing method. Thinning treatment explained 59\%, 61\%, and 45\% variance of the total, EcM, and saprotrophic fungal community structures, respectively, but it had no effect on the bacterial community, suggesting that fungi are more sensitive to thinning than bacteria. LT4, MT3, and HT2 increased the saprotrophic fungal abundance by 67\%, 67\%, and 125\%, respectively, but they reduced the EcM fungal abundance by 31\%, 46\%, and 84\%, respectively. In addition, thinning enhanced the soil C accumulation and nutrients availability. Overall, these findings suggest that saprotrophic fungi may play a critical role in microbial-mediated ecosystem functions like EcM fungi in the thinned larch stands.

AB  - Aims Heterogeneous canopies in temperate montane forests affect microclimate and soil characteristics, with important effects on soil microbial communities and related processes. Here, we studied the interactions between plant root traits and soil bacterial and fungal communities in closed forest and open gaps in a mixed forest along an elevational gradient in the French Alps (1400, 1700 and 2000 m). Methods Samples were separated into three fractions (plant root, rhizosphere and bulk soil), to further investigate the influence of plant zones on microbial communities. Bacterial (16S) and fungal (ITS) biodiversity was determined using high throughput sequencing, along with standard measures of soil, litter and root traits. Results We found that (i) microbial community diversity was higher in gaps than in closed forest because of increased root trait diversity and density; (ii) open versus closed forest patches affected phylogenetic dispersion despite differences in elevations with phylogenetic clustering in closed forest; (iii) the interaction between root traits and microbial communities was stronger for rhizosphere and root fractions than for bulk soil and (iv) bacterial community composition was better explained by root traits than for fungi. Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of open gaps versus closed forest patches and associated root traits affecting microbial community structure, particularly for bacterial assemblages that exhibited a stronger interaction with root traits than for fungi.

AB  - A harmonious interspecies relationship is the key to the success of mixed afforestation. This study was conducted to assess the responses of afforestation species to their neighboring trees. We examined five types of stands-monocultures of Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), and two mixtures (Chinese pine x black locust mixture and Chinese pine x sea-buckthorn mixture)-in the Loess Plateau, northwestern China. The height and diameter at breast height of each tree species were measured, and rhizosphere soil, shoot, and root were sampled. In monocultures, black locust was taller than Chinese pine and sea-buckthorn, while the height of Chinese pine and sea-buckthorn was similar. In mixtures, Chinese pine grew better with sea-buckthorn than alone as a result of modified soil properties and plant nutrition, but not with black locust. When Chinese pine was used as neighbors, it affected the level of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization of black locust, soil properties and AM fungal spore density of black locust and sea-buckthorn, but did not significantly affect their growth. Our results suggest that the reciprocal effects between tree species in mixture are not symmetric, and thus planning for efficient mixed afforestation requires knowledge of species-specific growth rate, nutrient requirements, and species interactions.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi contribute to the restoration of soil ecological functions and processes during ecosystem development. Here, diversity and differentiation of AM fungi in rhizosphere soils and roots of the dominant vegetation along a post-coal mining reclamation soil chronosequence of 3, 11, 15, 19 and 24 years after reclamation were investigated. High-throughput sequence analysis of partial Glomeromycotan 18S rRNA in soils and roots revealed a high number of core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across chronosequence. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) OTU richness, Shannon-Weiner index and species dominance were not significantly different across soil and root but were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with ammonium, nitrate, silt fraction, litter, pH, foliar and/or basal covers. AMF community structure was significantly different (P < 0.05) across unmined and reclamation chronosequence soils, with differentiation between younger reclaimed areas (3 and 11 years) and older reclamation ages (19 and 24 years) in multivariate space. In contrast, structural differentiation in the AMF community colonising the single plant-host across the chronosequence was not significant (PERMANOVA, P > 0.05), although community composition and structure were heterogeneous within 3-11 years but similar within 15-24 years. Seven Glomeromycotan genera were detected in soil and roots, including the relatively dominant Glomus genus, and the differentially abundant Acaulospora, Diversispora, Paraglomus and Scutellospora in either earlier or later years since post-mining reclamation. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that nitrates (NO3-N), clay content and bulk density significantly influenced (P < 0.05) the AMF community structure in soil, whereas, the AMF community in root was not significantly influenced (P > 0.05) by environmental variables. Overall, the study suggests that AMF community differentiation reflect ecosystem development over chronological space-time. Thus, AMF species differentiation may be included as part of a minimum dataset for monitoring ecosystem restoration following post-mining reclamation.

AB  - Forest management practices, such as selection or mixing of particular tree species, may enhance forests' carbon (C) sinks and resilience against climate change. While a majority of research on this subject has focused on aboveground production, far less is known about how these management decisions impact belowground C storage, as well as the C and nitrogen (N) stocks of the whole ecosystem. We used a well-replicated 60-year-old experiment in boreal Sweden comparing monocultures and a mixture of the two dominant coniferous species: Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.), set up at a site that was assessed as equally suitable for the growth of either species. Our aim was to evaluate the species identity and species mixing effects on ecosystem C and N stocks. We measured total standing volume, aboveground tree biomass, fine-root biomass, C and N pools in tree biomass and soil, litterfall inputs, and soil CO2 emissions. Our results show major differences in C allocation and growth patterns between spruce and pine. We found almost twice as high total standing volume and litterfall inputs in the pine stands than in the spruce stands. Higher proportion and amount of needle biomass resulted in larger amounts of N retained in the canopy and smaller accumulation of C and N in the humus in the spruce compared to pine stands. The C sinks in aboveground tree biomass and soil were larger in the pine compared to spruce stands at this site. In addition, a significantly higher soil CO2 efflux rate and fineroot biomass in the spruce compared to pine stands suggested greater tree internal allocation of C belowground to roots and ectomycorrhizal fungi in response to stronger N limitation. We found no significant mixing effect in the mixed stands, given the levels of the measured variables did not exceed levels of the most productive monoculture, with an exception of higher SOC stocks in the deeper (10-20 cm) mineral soil layer in the mixed stands. Our results do not support the idea of higher productivity and C sinks of forest mixtures compared to the best performing monoculture on the given site suggesting that these tree species are not complementary from a forest management perspective. However, in many cases the mixed stands performed equally well as the best monoculture, indicating that management for multi-species stands may not result in any loss in C uptake and storage.

AB  - We observed strong positive relationships between soil properties and forest dynamics of growth and mortality across twelve primary lowland tropical forests in a phosphorus-poor region of the Guiana Shield. Average tree growth (diameter at breast height) increased from 0.81 to 2.1mmyr(-1) along a soil texture gradient from 0 to 67\% clay, and increasing metal-oxide content. Soil organic carbon stocks in the top 30cm ranged from 30 to 118 tons C ha(-1), phosphorus content ranged from 7 to 600mgkg(-1) soil, and the relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ranged from 0 to 50\%, all positively correlating with soil clay, and iron and aluminum oxide and hydroxide content. In contrast, already low extractable phosphorus (Bray P) content decreased from 4.4 to <0.02mgkg(-1) in soil with increasing clay content. A greater prevalence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in more clayey forests that had higher tree growth and mortality, but not biomass, indicates that despite the greater investment in nutrient uptake required, soils with higher clay content may actually serve to sustain high tree growth in tropical forests by avoiding phosphorus losses from the ecosystem. Our study demonstrates how variation in soil properties that retain carbon and nutrients can help to explain variation in tropical forest growth and mortality, but not biomass, by requiring niche specialization and contributing to biogeochemical diversification across this region.

AB  - Purpose The aim of the study was to compare the activity, functional diversity, and community-level physiological profiles of soil microorganisms in light of soil physical and chemical properties in areas where a forest was damaged by hurricane-force winds and in untouched spruce forests of the lower montane belt of the Tatra Mountains (the Carpathians). Materials and methods Foehn winds caused a huge windfall in December 2013. The studied valley was strongly affected by windthrow, but in some places, patches of mature forest did survive. In the studied windthrow area, the first stage of secondary succession can now be observed. Sampling sites were selected in places where the soil was not mechanically disturbed. Soil samples were taken from the organic O and humus A soil horizons and basic soil properties were measured, as were the microbial parameters. Overall microbial activity was determined via the soil respiration rate (R), whereas the microbial biomass was determined via the substrate-induced respiration rate (SIR). Bacterial and fungal catabolic activity, functional diversity (H `), and community-level physiological profiles (CLPP) were determined using Biolog (R) ECO and FF plates, respectively. Results and discussion Research has shown that 21 months following the studied windthrow, in Hypereutric Skeletic Cambisols developed on calcareous parent material, changes have occurred in some soil properties: soil field moisture in O and A horizons has increased, DOC concentration in O horizons has decreased, and the C/N ratio in A horizons has decreased. The effect of the windthrow episode on overall biological activity was observed in soil A horizons, where overall microbial respiration and SIR biomass decreased. In both O and A horizons, the ratio of bacterial and fungal functional activity (AUC(bact/fungi)) increased as a result of a fungal AUC decrease. Significant differences in substrate utilization by bacteria occurred between forest-covered soils and windthrow soils in O horizons, where the share of polymer-utilized bacteria activity increased. Conclusions Rapid effects of windfall on soil microbial parameters expressed mostly in decrease overall microbial activity caused by breakdown in fungal activity. However, those differences are more pronounced in A than in O horizons. In spite of changes in those differences, windthrow did not produce a significant effect on the functional diversity index of microorganisms found in the studied soils.

AB  - Biotically-mediated weathering helps to shape Earth's surface. For example, plants expend carbon (C) to mobilize nutrients in forms whose relative abundances vary with depth. It thus is likely that trees' nutrient acquisition strategies-their investment in rooting systems and exudates-may function differently following disturbance-induced changes in depth of rooting zones and soil nutrient stocks. These changes may persist across centuries. We test the hypothesis that plant C allocation for nutrient acquisition is depth dependent as a function of rooting system development and relative abundances of organic vs. mineral nutrient stocks. We further posit that patterns of belowground C allocation to nutrient acquisition reveal anthropogenic signatures through many decades of forest regeneration. To test this idea, we examined fine root abundances and rooting system C in organic acid exudates and exo-enzymes in tandem with depth distributions of organically- and mineral-bound P stocks. Our design permitted us to estimate C tradeoffs between organic vs. mineral nutrient benefits in paired forests with many similar aboveground traits but different ages: post-agricultural mixed-pine forests and older reference hardwoods. Fine roots were more abundant throughout the upper 2 m in reference forest soils than in regenerating stands. Rooting systems in all forests exhibited depth-dependent C allocations to nutrient acquisition reflecting relative abundances of organic vs. mineral bound P stocks. Further, organic vs. mineral stocks underwent redistribution with historic land use, producing distinct ecosystem nutritional economies. In reference forests, rooting systems are allocating C to relatively deep fine roots and low-C exudation strategies that can increase mobility of mineral-bound P stocks. Regenerating forests exhibit relatively shallower fine root distributions and more diverse exudation strategies reflecting more variable nutrient stocks. We observed these disparities in rooting systems' depth and nutritional mechanisms even though the regenerating forests have attained aboveground biomass stocks similar to those in reference hardwood forests. These distinctions offer plausible belowground mechanisms for observations of continued C sink strength in relatively old forests, and have implications for soil C fates and soil development on timescales relevant to human lifetimes. As such, depth-dependent nutrient returns on plant C investments represent a subtle but consequential signal of the Anthropocene.

AB  - Soil phosphorus (P) availability and its distribution influence plant growth and productivity. To evaluate strategies that allow genotypes to be efficient under variable P environments, we planted six hybrid Populus deltoides clones belonging to the section Aigeiros (Aig), LL1, LL9, NL351, NL35, NL1388 and NL895, to three growth conditions in a greenhouse experiment, including low P, a high homogenous P supply and a high heterogeneous P supply. Functional traits, including foliar and root traits as well as rhizosphere processes, were measured. Large genotypic variation in shoot biomass and leaf P concentration was found in response to the P supply level and pattern. Compared with no P supply, LL1, LL9 and NL895 had a greater root length, biomass and P concentration in leaves under a homogenous P supply, while growth traits of NL351, NL35 and NL1388 were not significantly affected. A heterogeneous P supply enhanced the shoot biomass of LL1 and LL9. The root proliferation of LL1 and LL9 in P-rich patches was related to increased P acquisition in leaves. By contrast, a heterogeneous P supply did not enhance the biomass accumulation and the morphological plasticity of roots in other four genotypes, NL351, NL35, NL895 and NL1388, in P-rich patches. We found that functional traits or rhizosphere processes under low P could predict high P performance in Populus clones. Genotypes with a higher specific root length under low P can accumulate a larger biomass under a homogenous P supply. Conversely, high acid phosphatase concentrations decreased the positive impact of a heterogeneous P supply on a genotype's performance. Our results provide implications and applications for silviculture and forest management.

AB  - Peatlands are major carbon sinks globally, but it is still unclear what drives their shift from functioning as carbon sink to a source. Fungi rely on soil carbon inputs and play an active role in carbon mobilization and stabilization. Future climate change scenarios predict increases in temperature and lower water tables, which may lead to functional shifts in fungal communities growing in peatlands. Despite their abundance, the impact of fungi on carbon cycling in peatlands is still poorly understood. Therefore, it is crucial to study the dynamics and distribution of fungal communities in pristine peatlands in order to predict the potential changes in peatland ecosystems more accurately. Here, we review the current knowledge about fungal communities in peatlands, including the influence of peatland type, abiotic factors, and temporal and spatial dynamics on fungal diversity. Our overview shows that fungal diversity in peatlands of certain regions such as tropical areas is severely understudied. Furthermore, we examine the ecological roles and the relative contribution to carbon cycling of functional guilds of fungi in peatlands, showing that saprotrophs are the key guild in organic matter decomposition, and ericoid- and ectomycorrhizal fungi have the ability to act as decomposers and vectors of plant carbon input to soil. We suggest that the application of a combination of methodological approaches for taxonomic and functional characterisation of peatland fungal communities is needed to build better understanding about the diversity-functioning relationships in peatland ecosystems. Overall, this review shows that fungi must be considered as important drivers of mechanistic processes underlying biodiversity, plant nutrient uptake and carbon losses in peatlands.

AB  - Background and Aims Introducing exotic tree species for afforestation out of their natural range may alter the local ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities. The potential functional consequences shaped by exotic trees with recruited local ECM fungi rather than native trees remain unclear. This study examined (a) whether the composition and extracellular enzyme function of ECM fungal communities differed between native masson pine (Pinus massoniana) and exotic slash pine (Pinus elliottii) during seedling establishment; and (b) how differences in enzyme functioning were linked to the growth pattern of the host plants. Methods Native (masson) and exotic (slash) pine seedlings were planted into soil cores collected from each study site. At three months growth, root tips were collected from seedlings and assayed for ECM fungal community composition using high-throughput sequencing, and functioning using single root tip assays for enzymes associated with N, P and C acquisition. Results ECM fungi on masson pines showed higher activities of nitrogen- (N-acetylglucosaminidase, 280-300\%), phosphorus- (acid phosphatase, 105-152\%), and cellulose (beta-glucosidase, 204-235\%; cellobiohydrolase, 142-255\%) compound degrading enzymes compared to those on slash pines. Those differences was attributed to the host-specific performance of certain ECM fungal taxa, such as Rhizopogon spp. Information theory model selection showed that plant nutrient status in masson pines was correlated with the enzymatic contribution of Rhizopogon spp., whereas slash pines depended on a diverse enzyme palette from multiple ECM fungal taxa. Conclusions Host identity strongly influenced ECM fungal community composition and extracellular enzymatic functions of specific ECM fungal taxa, which could feedback to host establishment and nutrient cycling processes of restored ecosystem. Therefore, the origin of afforestation tree species should be an important factor when selecting tree species for restoration of degraded lands.

AB  - Soil respiration is the dominant pathway by which terrestrial carbon enters the atmosphere. Many abiotic and biotic processes can influence soil respiration, including soil microbial community composition. Mycorrhizal fungi are a particularly important microbial group because they are known to influence soil chemistry and nutrient cycling, and, because the type of mycorrhizal fungi in an ecosystem can be assessed based on the plant species present, they may be easier than other soil microbes to incorporate into ecosystem models. We tested how the type of mycorrhizal fungi-arbuscular (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi-associated with the dominant tree species in a mixed hardwood forest was related to soil respiration rate. We measured soil respiration, root biomass, and surface area, and soil chemical and physical characteristics during the growing season in plots dominated by ECM-associated trees, AM-associated trees, and mixtures with both. We found rates of soil respiration that were 29\% and 32\% higher in AM plots than in ECM and mixed plots, respectively. These differences are likely explained by the slightly higher nitrogen concentrations and deeper organic horizons in soil within AM plots compared with soil in ECM and mixed plots. Our results highlight the importance of considering mycorrhizal associations of dominant vegetation as predictors of carbon cycling processes.

AB  - Effective land-based solutions to climate change mitigation require actions that maximize soil carbon storage without generating surplus nitrogen. Land management for carbon sequestration is most often informed by bulk soil carbon inventories, without considering the form in which carbon is stored, its capacity, persistency and nitrogen demand. Here, we present coupling of European-wide databases with soil organic matter physical fractionation to determine continental-scale forest and grassland topsoil carbon and nitrogen stocks and their distribution between mineral-associated and particulate organic matter pools. Grasslands and arbuscular mycorrhizal forests store more soil carbon in mineral-associated organic carbon, which is more persistent but has a higher nitrogen demand and saturates. Ectomycorrhizal forests store more carbon in particulate organic matter, which is more vulnerable to disturbance but has a lower nitrogen demand and can potentially accumulate indefinitely. The share of carbon between mineral-associated and particulate organic matter and the ratio between carbon and nitrogen affect soil carbon stocks and mediate the effects of other variables on soil carbon stocks. Understanding the physical distribution of organic matter in pools of mineral-associated versus particulate organic matter can inform land management for nitrogen-efficient carbon sequestration, which should be driven by the inherent soil carbon capacity and nitrogen availability in ecosystems.

AB  - The mycorrhizal-associated nutrient economy hypothesis proposes a strong connection between plant and fungal traits and the dominant form of soil nutrients. If true, then shifting from an organic to an inorganic nutrient economy should benefit arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees because they are more suited to acquiring inorganic forms of nutrients and have limited decomposing capabilities when compared with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees. An inorganic nutrient economy was experimentally promoted by applying inorganic phosphorus (P) fertiliser and/or elevating soil pH with lime in three Allegheny Plateau mixed-mesophytic forests. Trees were measured over seven growing seasons to determine how growth responded to the treatments based on mycorrhizal association. AM-associated trees showed increased growth in response to increased inorganic nutrients, but ECM tree growth was suppressed when compared with the control. We also observed that understory and mid-story trees responded to the treatments, but large overstory trees showed no significant growth response. Results support the hypothesis that AM trees respond positively to an inorganic nutrient economy. While raising pH in acidic soils can be detrimental to ECM tree growth, the exact mechanism for this response is unclear.

AB  - In boreal systems, soil profiles typically consist of distinct stratified horizons, with organic layers at the surface overlying deeper mineral horizons providing microhabitat variation along a depth gradient, and vertical stratification of fungal communities along such soil profiles is commonly observed. We studied fungal community structure in a coastal pine forest along a gradient of decreasing influence from the coast. In this system, the vertical stratification pattern of soil microhabitats (defined here as organic, mineral with roots and mineral without roots: O, MR and MN, respectively) is non-uniform; organic horizons are sometimes buried under drifting sand dunes. Our results show that soil microhabitats are distinct with respect to physiochemical characteristics, community composition and OTU richness. While community composition was partly related to depth and distance from the coastal forest edge, microhabitat appeared to have the strongest influence. A closer inspection of the OTUs with the highest relative sequence abundance within each microhabitat revealed that microhabitats support functionally distinct fungal communities with respect to trophic mode and growth morphology. These results suggest that in coastal pine forests, variation in soil microhabitats contributes to the high fungal diversity found belowground and may play an important role in optimizing nutrient cycling.

AB  - Differences in nitrogen (N) acquisition patterns between plant species are often reflected in the natural N-15 isotope ratios (delta N-15) of the plant tissues, however, such differences are poorly understood for co-occurring plants in tropical and subtropical forests. To evaluate species variation in N acquisition traits, we measured leaf N concentration (\%N) and delta N-15 in tree and understory plant species under ambient N deposition (control) and after a decade of N addition at 50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (N-plots) in an old-growth subtropical forest in southern China. We also measured changes in leaf delta N-15 after one-year of N-15 addition in both the control and N-plots. The results show consistent significant species variation in leaf \%N in both control and N-plots, but decadal N addition did not significantly affect leaf \%N. Leaf delta N-15 values were also significantly different among the plant species both in tree and understory layers, and both in control and N-plots, suggesting differences in N acquisition strategies such as variation in N sources and dominant forms of N uptake and dependence on mycorrhizal associations among the co-occurring plant species. Significant differences between the plant species (in both control and N-plots) in changes in leaf delta N-15 after N-15 addition were observed only in the understory plants, indicating difference in access (or use) of deposited N among the plants. Decadal N addition had species-dependent effects on leaf delta N-15, suggesting the N acquisition patterns of these plant species are differently affected by N deposition. These results suggest that co-occurring plants in N-rich and subtropical forests vary in their N acquisition traits; these differences need to be accounted for when evaluating the impact of N deposition on N cycling in these ecosystems.

AB  - Aims Net primary productivity is expected to increase in many forests as Earth warms, which can increase litter inputs to soils and affect carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics. Understanding how increasing litter inputs affect soil C and N cycling in tropical and subtropical forests is important because they represent some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth, suggesting that small changes in these cycles can have large effects. Methods To test the effects of increased litter inputs and the interactive effect between microbes and roots on soil C and N stocks and dynamics, we manipulated litter inputs and used trenching to exclude roots in a 40-year-old Cunninghamia lanceolata Lamb. (Chinese fir) plantation. At the site, we measured soil C and N pools, soil C-13 and N-15 natural abundance, and potential activities for C-, N-, and phosphorus-acquiring enzymes. Results After four years of experimental treatment, we found that increasing litter inputs reduced total soil N content by 26\% relative to background litter inputs, but that increasing litter inputs did not affect soil C content in the plots with roots. In the plots without roots, both soil N and C did not change in response to litter inputs. In the plots with roots, soil delta N-15 increased with increasing litter inputs, but there was no effect in the plots without roots. We found a strong interactive effect between root and litter treatment on soil N pools and delta N-15. The decline in soil N pools and increase in soil delta N-15 were associated with elevated potential enzyme activity for N-acquisition (N-acetyl glucosaminidase). Conclusions Adding litter did not have a significant effect on soil C pools, likely because potential soil C losses were offset by increasing litter-derived C inputs. In contrast to C, adding litter decreased N availability, likely through multiple pathways including gaseous N losses, NO3- leaching, root N uptake, and interactions between saprotrophic microbes and roots during the four-year litter addition experiment. Global changes that increase litter production may lower N pools and imbalance C and N cycling in subtropical coniferous forest ecosystems.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) supports essential functions in terrestrial biomes and global biogeochemical cycles, and tropical tree plantations are often called upon to reverse deforestation-induced SOC loss. Yet the comparative efficacy of different plantation types and associated drivers of SOC restoration remain unclear. Theory suggests that higher chemical and spatial heterogeneity of plant litter should promote greater efficiency of soil microbial communities involved in SOC formation, so we hypothesised that more species-diverse tree plantations should be more effective in accelerating recovery of SOC. To test this, we compared developmental recovery of SOC and soil microbial communities between monoculture (Swietenia macrophylla King, mahogany) and highly diverse and mostly native species plantations (termed ``rainforestation{''}). All plantation types, which were aged 15 to 20 years, only restored the composition of the soil microbial community to 20-30\% of the reference, selectively logged old-growth rainforest. Contrary to our hypothesis, mahogany plantations, but not rainforestation, restored SOC and microbial function. Rainforestation shifted soil microbial composition and the composition of the understory vegetation closer to reference conditions. Soil microbial composition at all plantation sites was correlated with plant composition and functional traits, and better explained variation in SOC than land use. In particular, soil fungal PLFA biomass displayed a strong positive correlation with topsoil SOC concentration. This suggests that belowground restoration with tropical reforestation is slow relative to typical rotation times of tropical plantations (15-20 years). We conclude that reliable and rapid restoration of SOC may depend on interventions both above and below ground to re-instate the soil microbial community. This may require careful selection of plant species in combination with microbial inoculations.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is central to soil carbon (C) storage and terrestrial nutrient cycling. New data have upended the traditional model of stabilization, which held that stable SOM was mostly made of undecomposed plant molecules. We now know that microbial by-products and dead cells comprise unexpectedly large amounts of stable SOM because they can become attached to mineral surfaces or physically protected within soil aggregates. SOM models have been built to incorporate the microbial to mineral stabilization of organic matter, but now face a new challenge of accurately capturing microbial productivity and metabolism. Explicitly representing stoichiometry, the relative nutrient requirements for growth and maintenance of organisms, could provide a way forward. Stoichiometry limits SOM formation and turnover in nature, but important nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) are often missing from the new generation of SOM models. In this synthesis, we seek to facilitate the addition of these nutrients to SOM models by (1) reviewing the stoichiometric bias-the tendency to favor one element over another-of four key processes in the new framework of SOM cycling and (2) applying this knowledge to build a stoichiometrically explicit budget of C, N, P, and S flow through the major SOM pools. By quantifying the role of stoichiometry in SOM cycling, we discover that constraining the C:N:P:S ratio of microorganisms and SOM to specific values reduces uncertainty in C and nutrient flow as effectively as using microbial C use efficiency (CUE) parameters. We find that the value of additional constraints on stoichiometry vs. CUE varies across ecosystems, depending on how precise the available data are for that ecosystem and which biogeochemical pathways are present. Moreover, because CUE summarizes many different processes, stoichiometric measurements of key soil pools are likely to be more robust when extrapolated from soil incubations to plot or biome scale estimates. Our results suggest that measuring SOM stoichiometry should be a priority for future empirical work and that the inclusion of new nutrients in SOM models may be an effective way to improve precision.

AB  - Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), as an important component of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool, is a glycoprotein produced by the hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which play a vital role in carbon and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystem. Here we investigated the spatial distribution of GRSP in plant community of the dominated species not associated with AMF based on a typical coniferous and broad-leaved temperate forest in Mt. Changbai, Northeastern China. Spatial distribution of GRSP including easily extractable GRSP (EEG) and total GRSP (TG) is represented by Moran's I on different soil depth among seven soil layers of 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, 30-50 cm, 50-70 cm and 70-100 cm. The concentrations of EEG and TG decreased with the increase of soil depth according to a logarithmic function. The Moran's I coefficient of GRSP was negative in all soil layers except TG in 20-30 cm and 50-70 cm soil layers. When EEG and TG were considered, the Moran's I coefficient was positive in majority of soil layers within the separation distance of less than 4 m but in soil layers of 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm for EEG and in 30-50 cm for TG. The largest Moran's I coefficient including EEG and TG was observed in the soil layer of 5-10 cm. The spatial distribution of GRSP was discrete in typical coniferous and broad-leaved temperate forest, and was affected by mycorrhizal colonization rate, soil organic carbon and total nitrogen.

AB  - Background and aims Agricultural abandonment has been taken as one of the most widely used strategies for ecological restoration. Abandoned croplands expanded worldwide since the middle of the twentieth century and will increase considerably in the future. Whether agricultural abandonment alters the abundances of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization genes, and whether these functional genes are linked to alterations in C and N mineralization rates remain unknown. Methods We took advantage of a well-established chronosequence of nature restoration sites on abandoned croplands which represent a century of vegetation succession in China's Qinling Mountains, to determine soil C and N mineralization rates, and their relationships with vegetation succession, edaphic characteristics, soil microbial communities, and functional genes based on GeoChip 5.0. Results We found that soil C and N mineralization rates, microbial biomass and composition, and the number and abundances of functional genes were significantly affected by vegetation succession following agricultural abandonment. Soil C and N mineralization rates increased by sixfold and threefold, respectively, along the cropland to forest successional gradient. The NO3-N, NH4-N and soil available phosphorus (P) concentrations were important factors associated with the C and N mineralization genes. The shifts in edaphic environments (i.e., soil moisture, cation exchange capacity, and C/P ratio), vegetation-derived substrates (i.e., soil organic C and N), and soil microbial composition (i.e., Fungi/Bacteria ratio, amounts of Gram-negative bacteria, Actinomycetes, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi), rather than the abundances of functional genes involved in mineralization processes, controlled soil C and N mineralization rates along the long-term vegetation successional gradient. Conclusions Abandoning cropland for natural succession could facilitate the recuperation of soil C and N processes and alter soil microbial composition and functional genes. The abundances of microbial functional genes are less important than previously expected in regulating soil C and N mineralization rates.

AB  - Ecologists have frequently observed a pattern of fungal succession during litter decomposition, wherein different fungal taxa dominate different stages of decay in individual ecosystems. However, it is unclear which biological features of fungi give rise to this pattern. We tested a longstanding hypothesis that fungal succession depends on the evolutionary history of species, such that different fungal phyla prefer different decay stages. To test this hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis across studies in 22 different ecosystem types to synthesize fungal decomposer abundances at early, middle and late stages of plant litter decay. Fungal phyla varied in relative abundance throughout decay, with fungi in the Ascomycota reaching highest relative abundance during early stages of decay (P < 0.001) and fungi in the Zygomycota reaching highest relative abundance during late stages of decay (P < 0.001). The best multiple regression model to explain variation in abundance of these fungal phyla during decay included decay stage, as well as plant litter type and climate factors. Most variation in decay-stage preference of fungal taxa was observed at basal taxonomic levels (phylum and class) rather than finer taxonomic levels (e.g. genus). For many finer-scale taxonomic groups and functional groups of fungi, plant litter type and climate factors were better correlates with relative abundance than decay stage per se, suggesting that the patchiness of fungal community composition in space is related to both resource and climate niches of different fungal taxa. Our study indicates that decomposer fungal succession is partially rooted in fungal decomposers' deep evolutionary history, traceable to the divergence among phyla.

AB  - Enrichment of forest soils with inorganic nitrogen (N) tends to inhibit oxidative enzyme expression by microbes and reduces plant litter and soil organic matter decomposition rates. Without further explanation than is currently presented in the scientific literature, we argue that upregulation of oxidative enzymes seems a more competitive response to prolonged N enrichment at high rates than the observed downregulation. Thus, as it stands, observed responses are inconsistent with predicted responses. In this article, we present a hypothesis that resolves this conflict. We suggest that high rates of N addition alter the competitive balance between enzymatic lignin mineralisation and non-enzymatic lignin oxidation. Using metatransciptomics and chemical assays to examine boreal forest soils, we found that N addition suppressed peroxidase activity, but not iron reduction activity (involved in non-enzymatic lignin oxidation). Our hypothesis seems positioned as a parsimonious and empirically consistent working model that warrants further testing.

AB  - In grasslands, fire management and fertilization are established drivers of plant community change, but associated soil fungal responses are less well defined. We predicted that soil fungal communities would change seasonally, that decades of fire cessation and nitrogen (N) fertilization would alter fungal distributions, and that plant and fungal community change would be correlated. Surface soils were sampled monthly for 1 y from a 30-y fire by fertilization experiment to evaluate fungal community dynamics and assess correlation with plant community heterogeneity. ITS gene community composition was seasonally stable, excepting increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal summer abundance in the burned, fertilized treatment. Long-term treatments affected soil fungal and plant communities, with correlated heterogeneity patterns. Despite woody encroachment in the fire cessation treatment, soil fungal communities did not resemble those of forests. This study provides evidence supporting the strength of feedbacks between fungal and plant community change in response to long-term grassland fire and N management changes.

AB  - The negative impacts of non-native invasive plants on native plants has prompted intensive eradication efforts, but whether eradication can restore soil microbial communities that are also sensitive to invasion is generally not considered. Some invasive plants, like Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard), specifically alter soils in ways that promote the invasion process. Garlic mustard disrupts mycorrhizas, increases fungal pathogen loads, and elevates soil nutrient availability and soil pH; thus, the fungal community and soil property responses to garlic mustard eradication may be key to restoring ecosystem function in invaded forests. We conducted a garlic mustard eradication experiment at eight temperate, deciduous forests. 1 and 3 years after initiating annual garlic mustard removal (hand pulling), we collected soil samples and characterized fungal community structure using DNA metabarcoding alongside a suite of edaphic properties. We found that fungal richness, the number of shared fungal species, fungal biomass, and the relative abundance of fungal guilds became less similar to invaded plots by year three of eradication and more similar to uninvaded reference plots. However, fungal community composition did not resemble uninvaded communities by the third year of eradication and remained comparable to invaded communities. Soil chemical and physical properties also remained similar to invaded conditions. Overall soil abiotic-biotic restoration was not observed after 3 years of garlic mustard removal. Garlic mustard eradications may therefore not achieve management goals until soil physical, chemical, and biological properties become more similar to uninvaded forested areas or at least more dissimilar to invaded conditions that can promote invasion.

AB  - Boreal forests are ecosystems with low nitrogen (N) availability that store globally significant amounts of carbon (C), mainly in plant biomass and soil organic matter (SOM). Although crucial for future climate change predictions, the mechanisms controlling boreal C and N pools are not well understood. Here, using a three-year field experiment, we compare SOM decomposition and stabilization in the presence of roots, with exclusion of roots but presence of fungal hyphae and with exclusion of both roots and fungal hyphae. Roots accelerate SOM decomposition compared to the root exclusion treatments, but also promote a different soil N economy with higher concentrations of organic soil N compared to inorganic soil N accompanied with the build-up of stable SOM-N. In contrast, root exclusion leads to an inorganic soil N economy (i.e., high level of inorganic N) with reduced stable SOM-N buildup. Based on our findings, we provide a framework on how plant roots affect SOM decomposition and stabilization.

AB  - Trait-based ecology claims to offer a mechanistic approach for explaining the drivers that structure biological diversity and predicting the responses of species, trophic interactions and ecosystems to environmental change. However, support for this claim is lacking across broad taxonomic groups. A framework for defining ecosystem processes in terms of the functional traits of their constituent taxa across large spatial scales is needed. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the linkages between climate, plant traits and soil microbial traits at many sites spanning a broad latitudinal temperature gradient from tropical to subalpine forests. Our results show that temperature drives coordinated shifts in most plant and soil bacterial traits but these relationships are not observed for most fungal traits. Shifts in plant traits are mechanistically associated with soil bacterial functional traits related to carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling, indicating that microbial processes are tightly linked to variation in plant traits that influence rates of ecosystem decomposition and nutrient cycling. Our results are consistent with hypotheses that diversity gradients reflect shifts in phenotypic optima signifying local temperature adaptation mediated by soil nutrient availability and metabolism. They underscore the importance of temperature in structuring the functional diversity of plants and soil microbes in forest ecosystems and how this is coupled to biogeochemical processes via functional traits.

AB  - Boreal forests carry out functions that are critical to global biogeochemical cycling and climate regulation. Soil microbial diversity has been reported to drive multiple functions simultaneously (multifunctionality) in drylands and temperate ecosystems, however, the role and importance of bacterial and fungal diversity in driving multiple soil functions in boreal forest ecosystems remains poorly understood. We collected soils from 58 plots across upland and lowland (swamp) habitats in a boreal forest ecosystem to evaluate the linkages between fungal/bacterial diversity and multiple soil functions. Fungal and bacterial diversity were determined using 18S rDNA and 16S rDNA amplicons sequencing, and functions related to nutrient cycling (dissolved inorganic and organic nitrogen and carbon, nitrification) and climate regulation (CO2 and N2O emissions) were measured. The results showed that fungal but not bacterial richness was positively related to soil multifunctionality. We further used structural equation modelling to identify the effects of fungal and bacterial communities, and other environmental variables (moisture, pH, soil organic carbon and habitat types) on multifunctionality. Our model predicted 65.0\% of the variation in soil multifunctionality, and confirmed that along with moisture and habitats, fungal richness and community composition were significantly and positively associated with multifunctionality. Finally, we identified specific fungal genera strongly associated with soil multifunctionality, and saprotrophic fungi were especially important for maintaining multiple soil functions. Our results suggest that potential losses in fungal diversity could result in reductions in soil functions particularly linked to nutrient cycling and climate regulation in boreal forests.

AB  - Decomposition is a major flux of the carbon cycle in forest soils and understanding the involved processes is a key for budgeting carbon turnover. Decomposition is constrained by the presence of biological agents such as microorganisms and the underlying environmental conditions such as water availability. A metabarcoding approach of ribosomal markers was chosen to study the succession of bacterial and fungal decomposers on root litter. Litterbags containing pine roots were buried in a pine forest for two years and sequentially sampled. Decomposition and the associated communities were surveyed under ambient dry and long-term irrigation conditions. Early decomposition stages were characterized by the presence of fast-cycling microorganisms such as Bacteroidetes and Helotiales, which were then replaced by more specialized bacteria and litter-associated or parasitic groups such as Acidobacteria, white rots, and Pleosporales. This succession was likely driven by a decrease of easily degradable carbohydrates and a relative increase in persistent compounds such as lignin. We hypothesize that functional redundancy among the resident microbial taxa caused similar root decomposition rates in control and irrigated forest soils. These findings have important implications for drought-prone Alpine forests as frequent drought events reduce litter fall, but not litter decomposition, potentially resulting in lower carbon stocks.

AB  - Both fungal and bacterial communities in soils play key roles in driving forest ecosystem processes across multiple time scales, but how seasonal changes in environmental factors shape these microbial communities is not well understood. Here, we aimed to evaluate the importance of seasons, elevation, and soil depth in determining soil fungal and bacterial communities, given the influence of climate conditions, soil properties and plant traits. In this study, seasonal patterns of diversity and abundance did not synchronize between fungi and bacteria, where soil fertility explained the diversity and abundance of soil fungi but soil water content explained those of soil bacteria. Model-based clustering showed that seasonal changes in both abundant and rare taxonomic groups were different between soil fungi and bacteria. The cluster represented by ectomycorrhizal genus Lactarius was a dominant group across soil fungal communities and fluctuated seasonally. For soil bacteria, the clusters composed of dominant genera were seasonally stable but varied greatly depending on elevation and soil depth. Seasonally changing clusters of soil bacteria (e.g., Nitrospira and Pelosinus) were not dominant groups and were related to plant phenology. These findings suggest that the contribution of seasonal changes in climate conditions, soil fertility, and plant phenology to microbial communities might be equal to or greater than the effects of spatial heterogeneity of those factors. Our study identifies aboveground-belowground components as key factors explaining how microbial communities change during a year in forest soils at mid-to-high latitudes.

AB  - Ecosystem processes and the organisms involved are generally limited by the availability of one or more elements in soil, an important phenomenon to consider for our understanding of ecosystem functioning and future changes. Especially in tropical forests, typically growing on nutrient depleted soils, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) or other limitations are assumed. However, large-scale nutrient manipulation experiments revealed complex site-specific patterns and several authors raised the need for novel approaches to reveal deeper mechanistic insights on limitation patterns, especially concerning soil microbial activity. In order to gain such deeper knowledge, based on a short review of previous small-scale studies focusing on soil micro-organisms, we developed an experimental approach which controls for common biases, including indirect treatment effects, addition of co-elements or nutrient pulses. Using this technique, we tested the hypotheses that fungi growing in tropical forest soils are mainly limited by P and that N versus P limitations shift along an altitudinal gradient. Mesh bags of 38 mu m filled with sand were amended with weak ion exchange resins loaded with N, P or potassium (K) and buried underneath the litter layer at three altitudinal sites in southern Ecuador. After a period of four months, the in-growth of fungal hyphae was quantified, phospholipid fatty acids were analysed for a subset of samples, and chemical properties were determined. In line with the first hypothesis, hyphal abundance was increased in P-amended mesh bags, indicating P limitation. However, this pattern was not significantly shifted along the altitudinal gradient. By contrast, N addition increased hyphal abundance at the lowest site, compared to significant reductions at 2,000 and 3,000 m-not only in fungi but also in bacterial abundance as indicated by PLFA analyses, contradicting common soil-age hypotheses. Decreased nutrient immobilization and fungal in-growth at higher elevations suggest slow microbial activity, including nitrification, which may have caused toxic ammonium accumulation. The experimental design offers a promising tool to provide more mechanistic and soil-focused analyses specifically targeting microbes, which in this system strongly supported the hypothesis of primary fungal P limitation in tropical forest soils. A plain language summary is available for this article.

AB  - Most empirical and modeling research on soil carbon (C) dynamics has focused on those processes that control and promote C stabilization. However, we lack a strong, generalizable understanding of the mechanisms through which soil organic carbon (SOC) is destabilized in soils. Yet a clear understanding of C destabilization processes in soil is needed to quantify the feedbacks of the soil C cycle to the Earth system. Destabilization includes processes that occur along a spectrum through which SOC shifts from a `protected' state to an `available' state to microbial cells where it can be mineralized to gaseous forms or to soluble forms that are then lost from the soil system. These processes fall into three general categories: (1) release from physical occlusion through processes such as tillage, bioturbation, or freeze-thaw and wetting-drying cycles; (2) C desorption from soil solids and colloids; and (3) increased C metabolism. Many processes that stabilize soil C can also destabilize C, and C gain or loss depends on the balance between competing reactions. For example, earthworms may both destabilize C through aggregate destruction, but may also create new aggregates and redistribute C into mineral horizon. Similarly, mycorrhizae and roots form new soil C but may also destabilize old soil C through priming and promoting microbial mining; labile C inputs cause C stabilization through increased carbon use efficiency or may fuel priming. Changes to the soil environment that affect the solubility of minerals or change the relative surfaces charges of minerals can destabilize SOC, including increased pH or in the reductive dissolution of Fe-bearing minerals. By considering these different physical, chemical, and biological controls as processes that contribute to soil C destabilization, we can develop thoughtful new hypotheses about the persistence and vulnerability of C in soils and make more accurate and robust predictions of soil C cycling in a changing environment.

AB  - Among plant traits, plant secondary metabolites such as tannins mediate plant-herbivore interactions but also have after-life effects on litter decomposition and nutrient cycling. We propose that niche construction mechanisms based on positive plant-soil feedback (PSF) could influence the evolution of tannin production. By modelling the flow of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) through plants and soil in a spatially explicit context, we explored the relative contribution of herbivory and positive PSF as drivers of tannin evolution. We assumed soil N to be contained in labile and recalcitrant compartments, the latter made of tannin-protein complexes from which plants can absorb nutrients via associations with mycorrhizal fungi. In infertile environments and for plants with low biomass turnover rates, we show that when tannins modify soil properties locally, positive PSF alone can drive their evolution. We further predict the existence of positive coevolutionary feedback between associations with mycorrhizal fungi with a decaying ability and tannins, possibly triggered by the evolution of the latter as protection against herbivores. In line with our theoretical results, empirical evidence suggest that tannins are mostly present in plants with low tissue turnover, associated with mycorrhizal fungi able to decay organic matter and inhabiting infertile environments. Synthesis. Our model proposes that the evolution of tannin production can be triggered by positive plant-soil feedback, provided that tannins promote the local N retention and that mycorrhizal fungi associated with plants are able to absorb N from tannin-protein complexes. In our model, tannin production evolves only in infertile ecosystems, in agreement with field observations. Our findings highlight that the strength of niche construction depends on the ecological context, hence that global ecological properties constrain local eco-evolutionary dynamics.

AB  - Wildfire is the dominant disturbance in boreal forests and fire activity is increasing in these regions. Soil fungal communities are important for plant growth and nutrient cycling postfire but there is little understanding of how fires impact fungal communities across landscapes, fire severity gradients, and stand types in boreal forests. Understanding relationships between fungal community composition, particularly mycorrhizas, and understory plant composition is therefore important in predicting how future fire regimes may affect vegetation. We used an extreme wildfire event in boreal forests of Canada's Northwest Territories to test drivers of fungal communities and assess relationships with plant communities. We sampled soils from 39 plots 1 year after fire and 8 unburned plots. High-throughput sequencing (MiSeq, ITS) revealed 2,034 fungal operational taxonomic units. We found soil pH and fire severity (proportion soil organic layer combusted), and interactions between these drivers were important for fungal community structure (composition, richness, diversity, functional groups). Where fire severity was low, samples with low pH had higher total fungal, mycorrhizal, and saprotroph richness compared to where severity was high. Increased fire severity caused declines in richness of total fungi, mycorrhizas, and saprotrophs, and declines in diversity of total fungi and mycorrhizas. The importance of stand age (a surrogate for fire return interval) for fungal composition suggests we could detect long-term successional patterns even after fire. Mycorrhizal and plant community composition, richness, and diversity were weakly but significantly correlated. These weak relationships and the distribution of fungi across plots suggest that the underlying driver of fungal community structure is pH, which is modified by fire severity. This study shows the importance of edaphic factors in determining fungal community structure at large scales, but suggests these patterns are mediated by interactions between fire and forest stand composition.

AB  - The roles of soil fungal diversity and community composition in regulating soil respiration when above- and below-ground plant carbon (C) inputs are excluded remain unclear. In the present study, we aimed to examine the following. (a) How does the exclusion of above- and below-ground plant C inputs affect soil respiration and soil fungi singly and in combination? (b) Are changes in soil fungal diversity aligned with changes in soil respiration? A field experiment with manipulation of plant C inputs was established in a subtropical forest in southwest China in 2004 with litter removal and tree stem-girdling to exclude inputs of the above- and below-ground plant C, respectively. In 2009, we measured the rates of soil respiration with an infrared gas analyser and soil fungal community structure using Illumina sequencing. We found that the rates of soil respiration were reduced significantly by litter removal and girdling, by similar magnitudes. However, they were not decreased further by the combination of these two treatments compared to either treatment alone. In contrast, litter removal increased the diversity of soil fungal communities, whereas girdling decreased the abundance of symbiotrophic fungi but increased the abundance of saptrotrophic and pathotrophic fungi. These changes in soil fungal community might initiate CO2 emission from soil C decomposition, offsetting further decline in soil respiration when plant C inputs are excluded. These results revealed that the exclusion of the above- and below-ground plant C inputs led to contrasting soil fungal communities but similar soil function. Our findings suggest that both above- and below-ground plant C are important in regulating soil respiration in subtropical forests, by limiting substrates for soil fungal growth and altering the diversity and composition of the soil fungal community. Highlights Litter removal and girdling decreased soil respiration by similar magnitudes The combination of litter removal and girdling did not further decrease soil respiration Litter removal significantly increased species richness of soil fungal communities Girdling changed the abundance of functional guilds of soil fungal communities

AB  - American chestnut (Castenea dentata), once dominant throughout the eastern deciduous forest of North America, was extirpated from its native range by chestnut blight fungus. Through development of blight-resistant trees, the reintroduction of chestnut is likely, though little is known about the biogeochemistry of forests influenced by chestnut. We performed a one-year laboratory incubation experiment with soil and litter from 10-year-old monoculture plantings of pure American chestnut, black cherry, and northern red oak, in addition to a field-based C-13 isotopic analysis of soil C. Parameters included litter decomposition, C respiration, N leaching, soil oxidizable C, extracellular enzyme activity related to nutrient acquisition, and litter chemistry. Results indicate that chestnut litter decayed more rapidly than that of oak or cherry (19.0\%, 10.8\%, 14.1\% mass loss in chestnut, oak, and cherry litter, respectively). Chestnut had lower N leaching rates than soils beneath oak or cherry (7.8, 11.5, and 12.0 mg N kg(-1) in chestnut, cherry, and oak soils, respectively), greater dissolved organic C (DOC) in leachate than soils influenced by oak (32.2 and 26.4 mg kg(-1) in chestnut and oak soil, respectively). No differences in soil respiration or total soil C by species were detected. We conclude that surface soils influenced by chestnut have large inputs of C through rapid litter decomposition and low inorganic N availability, indicating potential for accumulation of C in surface soil over the long-term.

AB  - The Philippines is known as one of the megadiverse countries in the world. One of its important biological resources are macrofungi which play an active role in wood decomposition, thereby contributing to nutrient recycling in the forest ecosystem. However, in spite of the important ecological role of macrofungi, little is known about their biodiversity in the Philippines. Investigations on the taxonomy and diversity of macrofungi are also gaining importance, as many macrofungi species are on the brink of extinction due to environmental destruction. Therefore, this study was conducted to document the different species of macrofungi in Ifugao Province, Philippines to come up with a species list of macrofungi in areas inhabited by the Ifugao indigenous community. Purposive sampling method was done to scan the nine barangay study sites: Bangaan, Poitan and Viewpoint in the municipality of Banaue, Bokiawan, Hapao and Poblacion in the municipality of Hungduan, and Chaya, Chumang and Mapawoy in the municipality of Mayoyao. Collected macrofungal samples were identified using both morphological and molecular methods. A total of 144 macrofungal samples were collected; out of these, 109 species were identified: 74 morphologically and 35 molecularly. Of these samples, 71 macrofungi were identified up to the species level while 34 could only be identified up to the genus level. The identified macrofungi belonged to 30 families, 47 genera and 47 species. Sixteen identified species of macrofungi were utilized as food as declared by the community and these are Agaricus sp., Auricularia auricula, Coprinellus disseminatus, Coprinus comatus, Lentinus sajorcaju, Lenzites elegans, Mycena sp., Oudemansiella canarii, Phellinus sp., Pleurotus djamor, Pleurotus ostreatus, Pleurotus sp., Schizophyllum commune, Trametes elegans, Termitomyces sp. and Vascellum pratense. This study is the first report on macrofungal diversity in the area inhabited by the Ifugao community in Ifugao Province.

AB  - Fine root decomposition constitutes a critical yet poorly understood flux of carbon and nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we present the first large-scale synthesis of species trait effects on the early stages of fine root decomposition at both global and local scales. Based on decomposition rates for 279 plant species across 105 studies and 176 sites, we found that mycorrhizal association and woodiness are the best categorical traits for predicting rates of fine root decomposition. Consistent positive effects of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and negative effects of lignin concentration emerged on decomposition rates within sites. Similar relationships were present across sites, along with positive effects of temperature and moisture. Calcium was not consistently related to decomposition rate at either scale. While the chemical drivers of fine root decomposition parallel those of leaf decomposition, our results indicate that the best plant functional groups for predicting fine root decomposition differ from those predicting leaf decomposition.

AB  - Deforestation has a substantial impact on aboveground biodiversity, but the response of belowground soil fungi remains poorly understood. In a tropical montane rainforest in southwestern China, plots were established along a forest degradation gradient ranging from mature and regenerated forests to open land to examine the impacts of forest degradation and deforestation on ecosystem diversity and function. Here, we evaluated the changes in belowground fungal diversity and community composition using a metabarcoding approach. Soil saprotrophic fungal richness declined with increasing forest disturbance. For example, Penicillium spp. (phosphorus {[}P]-solubilizing fungi) dominated in mature forest but were less abundant in regenerating forests and showed the lowest abundance in open land sites. Conversely, the abundance of facultative pathogenic fungi increased along the disturbance gradient. The decline in soil saprophytic fungi may be a direct result of forest disturbance or it may be associated with increased availability of soil phosphorus indirectly through an increase in soil pH. The increase in abundance of facultative pathogenic fungi may be related to reduced competition with saprotrophic fungi, changes in microclimate, or increased spore rain. These results demonstrate a loss of dominant P-solubilizing saprotrophic fungi along the disturbance gradient, indicating a change from soil P limitation in mature tropical forests to soil C limitation in deforested sites. The increased prevalence of pathogenic fungi may inhibit plant succession following deforestation. Overall, this research demonstrates that soil fungi can be used as a sensitive indicator for soil health to evaluate the consequences of forest disturbance. IMPORTANCE The soil fungal functional group changes in response to forest disturbance and indicates a close interaction between the aboveground plant community and the belowground soil biological community. Soil saprotrophic fungi declined in relative abundance with increasing forest disturbance. At the same time, the relative abundance of facultative pathogenic fungi increased. The loss of saprotrophic fungal richness and abundance may have been a direct result of forest disturbance or an indirect result of changes in soil pH and soil P. Furthermore, the dominant P-solubilizing saprotrophic fungi were replaced by diverse facultative pathogenic fungi, which have weaker C decomposition ability. These changes potentially indicate a shift from soil phosphate limitation to carbon limitation following deforestation. This study suggests that changes in fungal functional group composition can be used as an indicator of the effects of forest disturbance on soil carbon and nutrients.

AB  - Aim Leaf nutrient resorption is a key nutrient conservation trait, which also influences nutrient cycling rates and pools. Most global biogeochemical models assume that resorption is non-varying at a temporal scale. However, this trait can differ substantially within populations among years. We assessed the commonality of attaining proficient resorption, the factors associated with proficient resorption, as well as the variability of this trait and the factors controlling trait variability. Location Global. Time period 1965-2009. Major taxa studied Plants. Methods We compiled multi-year nutrient resorption data from the literature, representing 50 studies, 94 unique study locations, and 141 species from 53 families and 29 orders. We used multiple linear regression to relate resorption data, as well as the variability in this trait, expressed as the coefficient of variation, to environmental factors. Results Resource availability was a key driver of resorption, with nutrient-poor soils associated with more complete resorption and lower resorption plasticity. Nitrogen and phosphorus resorption differentially responded to some drivers, such as leaf habit, soil order and mycorrhizal status. Main conclusions Overall, environmental and biological factors representing a strong selective force for nutrient conservation, such as nutrient-poor soil orders, semi-arid soil moisture regimes, or lack of plant mutualists, were associated with complete resorption, whereas incomplete resorption was associated with weak selective forces, such as nutrient-rich soil orders, or factors impeding this physiological process (e.g., drought). Inter-annual variability in resorption was common, particularly for phosphorus. This plasticity has implications for ecosystem nutrient cycling and plant productivity, and accounting for this plasticity in dynamic models of nutrient cycling will improve predictions of nutrient limitations and productivity under future climate conditions.

AB  - To understand nutrient cycling in soils, soil processes and microorganisms need be better characterized. To determine whether specific trophic groups of fungi are associated with soil enzyme activity, we used soil imprinting to guide mm-scale sampling from microsites with high and low phosphatase activities in birch/Douglas-fir stands. Study 1 involved sampling one root window per site at 12 sites of different ages (stands); study 2 was conducted at one of the stem-exclusion stands, at which 5 root windows had been installed. Total fungal and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) fingerprints differed between high- and low-phosphatase activity microsites at 8 of 12 root windows across 12 sites. Where differences were detected, fewer EM fungi were detected in high- than low-phosphatase activity microsites. Using 5 root windows at one site, next-generation sequencing detected similar fungal communities across microsites, but the ratio of saprotrophic to EM fungal reads was higher in high-phosphatase activity microsites in the two windows that had low EM fungal richness. In windows with differences in fungal communities, both studies indicated that EM fungi were less successful than saprotrophic fungi in colonizing fine-scale, organic matter-rich microsites. Fine-scale sampling linked with in situ detection of enzyme activity revealed relationships between soil fungal communities and phosphatase activity that could not be observed at the scales employed by conventional approaches, thereby contributing to the understanding of fine-scale phosphorus cycling in forest soils.

AB  - Understanding the responses of heterotrophic (R-h) and autotrophic (R-a) components of soil respiration (R-s) to warming is important in evaluating and modelling the effects of changes in climate on soil carbon (C) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. We used a mesocosm system with buried heating cables (5 degrees C warming) to investigate the responses of R-s, R-h and R-a to warming in a subtropical forest in southern China. Soil CO2 effluxes were measured with a portable automatic soil CO2 flux system from March 2014 to July 2015. We found that warming increased mean R-s and R-h from 788 to 1036 g C m(-2) year(-1) (+31\%) and from 512 to 707 g C m(-2) year(-1) (+38\%), respectively. There was no difference in R-a between the warming treatment and the control. The lack of response of R-a to warming was probably because the fine root biomass did not change with warming treatment. Soil warming also increased available dissolved organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, actinomycetal biomass and arbuscular mycorrhizal biomass. Our results suggest that R-h might be more sensitive to climate warming than R-a, and future climate warming could increase soil C loss from increased R-h in subtropical forest ecosystems. Highlights A field warming experiment with partitioning of soil respiration in a humid subtropical forest. Warming increased R-s and R-h without significantly altering soil microbial substrate availability. Heterotrophic respiration appeared more sensitive to warming than autotrophic respiration. Warming increased Actinomycetes bacteria and Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

AB  - Rates of leaf litter decay are generally expected to accelerate with increasing temperature. However, chronic temperature elevation may cause changes in the quality of litter residues or in the composition of decompose communities that result in unexpected decay responses. We performed a 23-month litter decomposition study al a long-term soil warming experiment to determine how soil warming affects litter decay rate, litter chemistry extracellular enzyme activities, and fungal community composition. Experimental soil warming did not affect litter mass loss, but did result in a 23\% increase in the relative abundance of lignin; a concomitant shift in enzyme activity wherein lignin-decomposing enzymes had higher activity in the heated treatment while cellu. lose-decomposing enzymes were suppressed; and a shift in the composition of the active fungal community. In particular, ectomycorrhizal fungi were three times more abundant in the heated treatment than the control, and shifts in fungal community composition were significantly correlated with the observed changes in extracellular enzyme activities. Our results suggest that warming altered the trajectory of decay resulting in litter residue: enriched in lignin compounds and that were populated by a higher relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi. These shifts may have altered the temperature sensitivity of litter decay by reducing the quality of litter residue: and changing fungal community function.

AB  - It is now widely accepted that the majority of tropical landscapes are in transition from disturbance to recovery. Remediation efforts are occurring in Central and South America, attempting to recuperate the soils, often using indigenous nitrogen (N)-fixing tree species. Tree species-generated soil microbial heterogeneity might be important in facilitating regeneration of forest vegetation growth and, although some work has identified these efforts may enhance the soil carbon (C), there have been few studies conducted on how these trees are affecting the below-ground soil biological dynamics in these regions. Here, we explored how and to what extent individual plant effects of a native N-fixing and non-N-fixing plant has affected the below-ground soil C and N metrics and soil bacterial and fungal community composition. To begin to address this, we examined if there were differences in various soil abiotic factors (ToC, TN, C:N ratio, C-mic , NH4+, NO3-, pH, and \% moisture) and in the soil bacterial and fungal community composition associated with soil of a native non-N-fixer, Dipteryx panamensis and a native N-fixer, Pentaclethra macroloba, and in comparison to the primary forest bulk-soil in which these tree species occur. We found that primary forest-soils had the greatest amounts of soil NH4+ and C-mic, followed by Pentaclethra-soils. Dipteryx-soils had the least amount of soil C-mic and NH4+, but the greatest amounts of soil NO3-. The PERMANOVA results indicated that the Bray-Curtis soil bacterial and fungal community compositions were significantly different between N-fixing and non-N-fixing tree-soils, and also to that of the primary forest-soils. Our results also demonstrated that soil NH4+ best explained the variation observed in the soil C-mic patterns (39.2\%), and, both the soil bacterial (22.8\%) and fungal community composition (18.1\%). Furthermore, we provide evidence that the N-fixer Pentaclethra-soils stimulates the production of more soil C-mic than the non-N-fixer Dipteryx-soils. It is clear that these tree species are important in creating changes in the soil microbial community composition, and that NH4+ may be associated with a shift in a functional response that may have implications for CUE and remediation in this region.

AB  - Recent initiatives, such as the United Nations declaring 2015 as the International Year of Soils and the French ``4 per 1000{''} initiative call attention on soils and on the importance of maintaining and increasing soil organic matter stocks for soil fertility and food security, and for climate change adaptation and mitigation. We stress that soil organic carbon storage (i.e. an increase of soil organic carbon stocks) should be clearly differentiated from soil organic carbon sequestration, as the latter assumes a net removal of atmospheric CO2. Implementing management options that allow increasing soil organic carbon stocks at the local scale raises several questions, which are discussed in this article: how can we increase SOC stocks, at which rate and for how long; where do we prioritize SOC storage; how do we estimate the potential gain in C and which agricultural practices should we implement? We show that knowledge and tools are available to answer many of these questions, while further research remains necessary for others. A range of agricultural practices would require a re-assessment of their potential to store C and a better understanding of the underlying processes, such as no tillage and conservation agriculture, irrigation, practices increasing below ground inputs, organic amendments, and N fertilization. The vision emerging from the literature, showing the prominent role of soil microorganisms in the stabilization of soil organic matter, draw the attention to more exploratory potential levers, through changes in microbial physiology or soil biodiversity induced by agricultural practices, that require in-depth research.

AB  - Rising winter air temperature will reduce snow depth and duration over the next century in northern hardwood forests. Reductions in snow depth may affect soil bacteria and fungi directly, but also affect soil microbes indirectly through effects of snowpack loss on plant roots. We incubated root exclusion and root ingrowth cores across a winter climate-elevation gradient in a northern hardwood forest for 29 months to identify direct (i.e., winter snow-mediated) and indirect (i.e., root-mediated) effects of winter snowpack decline on soil bacterial and fungal communities, as well as on potential nitrification and net N mineralization rates. Both winter snowpack decline and root exclusion increased bacterial richness and phylogenetic diversity. Variation in bacterial community composition was best explained by differences in winter snow depth or soil frost across elevation. Root ingrowth had a positive effect on the relative abundance of several bacterial taxonomic orders (e.g., Acidobacterales and Actinomycetales). Nominally saprotrophic (e.g., Saccharomycetales and Mucorales) or mycorrhizal (e.g., Helotiales, Russalales, Thelephorales) fungal taxonomic orders were also affected by both root ingrowth and snow depth variation. However, when grouped together, the relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and ectomycorrhizal fungi were not affected by root ingrowth or snow depth, suggesting that traits in addition to trophic mode will mediate fungal community responses to snowpack decline in northern hardwood forests. Potential soil nitrification rates were positively related to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea abundance (e.g., Nitrospirales, Nitrosomondales, Nitrosphaerales). Rates of N mineralization were positively and negatively correlated with ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi, respectively, and these relationships were mediated by root exclusion. The results from this study suggest that a declining winter snowpack and its effect on plant roots each have direct effects on the diversity and abundance of soil bacteria and fungal communities that interact to determine rates of soil N cycling in northern hardwood forests.

AB  - Fungal abundance and diversity were assessed in two differently managed forest soils. In soil 1, chipped woody debris had been spread on the top soil and mixed with the soil by standard deep ploughing to 50cm. In soil 2, woody debris was removed and there was no ground preparation. Ten years later, the different methods of management resulted in unexpectedly distinctive habitat heterogeneity with a high variation in structure of the mycobiota communities. Incorporation of woody debris into soil resulted in lower abundance of fungi but greater fungal diversity (which may enhance ecosystem stability) and was beneficial for the growth of Scots pines. Removal of post-harvest woody debris from the surface of the clear-cut site with no subsequent ground preparation, compared with incorporating chipped debris and deep ploughing, resulted in the soil of the subsequent 10-year-old Scots pine plantation having: (a) 159-fold greater abundance of fungi, (b) lower fungal diversity, (c) different fungal community composition, (d) higher proportion of mycorrhizal fungi, (e) no root rot pathogens, (f) less tree biomass. The study showed that removal of post-harvest woody debris and no ground preparation is potentially beneficial for the health of young coniferous trees.

AB  - Accurate projections of the terrestrial carbon (C) sink are critical to understanding the future global C cycle and setting CO2 emission reduction goals. Current earth system models (ESMs) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) with coupled carbon-nitrogen cycles project that future terrestrial C sequestration will be limited by nitrogen (N) availability, but the magnitude of N limitation remains a critical uncertainty. Plants use multiple symbiotic nutrient acquisition strategies to mitigate N limitation, but current DGVMs omit these mechanisms. Fully coupling N-acquiring plant-microbe symbioses to soil organic matter (SOM) cycling within a DGVM for the first time, we show that increases in N acquisition via SOM decomposition and atmospheric N-2 fixation could support long-term enhancement of terrestrial C sequestration at global scales under elevated CO2. The model reproduced elevated CO2 responses from two experiments (Duke and Oak Ridge) representing contrasting N acquisition strategies. N release from enhanced SOM decomposition supported vegetation growth at Duke, while inorganic N depletion limited growth at Oak Ridge. Global simulations reproduced spatial patterns of N-acquiring symbioses from a novel niche-based map of mycorrhizal fungi. Under a 100-ppm increase in CO2 concentrations, shifts in N acquisition pathways facilitated 200 Pg C of terrestrial C sequestration over 100years compared to 50 Pg C for a scenario with static N acquisition pathways. Our results suggest that N acquisition strategies are important determinants of terrestrial C sequestration potential under elevated CO2 and that nitrogen-enabled DGVMs that omit symbiotic N acquisition may underestimate future terrestrial C uptake. Plain Language Summary Plants grow faster when there is more carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air. Because plant growth removes CO2 from the air, this faster plant growth could lessen the warming that is caused by CO2 emissions from human activities. However, plants also need nitrogen to grow, and the availability of this nutrient could constrain, or limit, how much CO2 plants can remove from the air. Correctly predicting the degree of nitrogen limitation of plant growth is a major challenge for global land models. Some plants can overcome nitrogen limitation by partnering with fungi that extract nitrogen from the soil or with bacteria that extract nitrogen from the air. We incorporated these plant-microbe partnerships into a global land model, and we show that these partnerships could sustain plant growth under rising CO2 concentrations. This suggests that existing models and experiments that do not include these partnerships may underestimate the potential for future CO2 uptake by plants.

AB  - Background and aimsMicrobial communities are the primary drivers of organic matter decomposition in peatlands. However, limited knowledge is available regarding depth-dependent microbial community structure and function in East Asian peatlands, using cultivation independent approaches.MethodsWe investigated the vertical stratification of prokaryote and fungal communities in a moderately rich fen in northeast China (Hani) and a rich fen in southwest China (Riganqiao).ResultsFungal and prokaryotic operational taxonomic unit (OTU) composition exhibited strong site and/or depth responses. Prokaryotic OTUs exhibited the greatest alpha diversity at the mesotelm hot spot', whereas the predicted metagenomic metabolic functions did not align with the pattern of prokaryote alpha diversity. The large cover of shrubs contributed to a greater relative abundance of ericoid- and ecto-mycorrhizal fungi at Hani, whereas Riganqiao showed more arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Soil pH and water table depth were among the predominant abiotic factors associated with microbial community composition.ConclusionsProjected shifts in hydrology and/or vegetation with global change may cause substantial impacts on peatland microorganisms and thus the associated biogeochemistry. It is critical to better understand the mechanism of the discrepancy between microbial community structure and the functions at the mesotelm hot spot' when evaluating the ecosystem functions in peatlands.

AB  - Litter decomposition is a prominent pathway for nutrient availability and management in terrestrial ecosystems. An in-situ litter decomposition experiment was carried out for different land use types along an elevation gradient in the Taihang Mountain area restored after heavy forest degradation in the past. Four land use types, i.e., cropland, shrubland, grassland, and forest, selected randomly from a 300-700 m elevation were investigated for the experiment using the litter bag technique. Litter mass loss ranged from 26.9\% (forest) to 44.3\% (cropland) varying significantly among land use types. The initial litter quality, mainly N and C/N, had a significant effect on the litter loss rate. The interaction of elevation x land use types x time was significant (p < 0.001). Litter nutrient mobility (K > P approximate to N > C) of the decomposing litter was sporadic with substantial stoichiometric effects of C/N, N/P, and C/P. The residual litters were enriched in N-15 and depleted in C-13 as compared to the initial litter. Increment of N, P, and delta N-15 values in residual litter indicates that, even in the highly weathered substrate, plant litter plays a crucial role in conserving nutrients. This study is a strong baseline for monitoring the functioning of the Taihang Mountain ecosystem restored after the complete destruction in the early 1990s.

AB  - Wildfires burn approximately 1\% of boreal forest yearly, being one of the most significant factors affecting soil organic matter (SOM) pools. Boreal forests are largely situated in the permafrost zone, which contains half of global soil carbon (C). Wildfires advance thawing of permafrost by burning the insulating organic layer and decreasing surface albedo, thus increasing soil temperatures. Fires also affect SOM quality through chemical and physical changes, such as the formation of resistant C compounds. The long-term post-fire effects on SOM quality, degradability and isotopic composition are not well known in permafrost forests. We studied the effect of forest fires on the proportional sizes of SOM pools with chemical fractionation (extracting with water, ethanol and acid) of soil samples (5, 30 and 50cm depths) collected from a fire chronosequence in the upland mineral soils of the Canadian permafrost zone. We also determined the C-13 and N-15 isotopic composition of soil after fire. In the topsoil horizon (5cm) recent fire areas contained a smaller fraction of labile SOM and were slightly more enriched with N-15 and C-13 than older fire areas. The SOM fraction ratios reverted towards pre-fire status with succession. Changes in SOM were less apparent deeper in the soil. Best predictors for the size of recalcitrant SOM fraction were active layer depth, vegetation biomass and soil C/N ratio, whereas microbial biomass was best predicted by the size of the recalcitrant SOM fraction. Results indicated that SOM in upland mineral soils at the permafrost surface could be mainly recalcitrant and its decomposition not particularly sensitive to changes resulting from fire.

AB  - AimsNitrogen (N) addition could affect litter decomposition through its direct effects on soil N availability and indirect effects on initial litter chemistry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative contribution of these direct and indirect effects to the decomposition of fine roots with different diameter classes.MethodsA two-year reciprocal replant-transplant field experiment was conducted in a Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) plantation to examine the relative effect of exogenous and endogenous N enrichment induced by N addition (10gNm(-2)yr.(-1)) on the decomposition of fine roots with different diameter classes: < 0.5mm (small fine root, SFR) and 0.5-2mm (large fine root, LFR).ResultsThe LFR had significantly higher decomposition rates (k: 0.315-0.397yr.(-1)) than the SFR (0.245-0.274yr.(-1)) after 2years of incubation. Exogenous N (i.e., increased soil N availability due to N addition) had no significant effect on the decomposition rates of fine roots, whereas endogenous N (i.e. increased N concentration in litter due to N addition) inhibited and accelerated the decomposition of SFR and LFR, respectively. Endogenous N decreased the net release of N but both endogenous and exogenous N increased the net release of phosphorus (P) from SFR. By contrast, exogenous and endogenous N decreased the net release of N and P from LFR.ConclusionsOur results suggest that N addition affected fine root decomposition indirectly by changing the chemical traits of fine roots rather than directly through changing soil N availability. Elevated input and decreased net N release of fine roots might be a potential mechanism explaining the increases of total organic carbon and total N in the semi-arid forest soil under N addition. Our study also suggests that SFR may be a more important source of stable soil organic matter relative to LFR.

AB  - The extent of young postfire conifer forests is growing throughout western North America as the frequency and size of high-severity fires increase, making it important to understand ecosystem structure and function in early seral forests. Understanding nitrogen (N) dynamics during postfire stand development is especially important because northern conifers are often N limited. We resampled lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) stands that regenerated naturally after the 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA) to ask (1) How have N pools and fluxes changed over a decade (15 to 25 yr postfire) of very rapid forest growth? (2) At postfire year 25, how do N pools and fluxes vary with lodgepole pine density and productivity? Lodgepole pine foliage, litter (annual litterfall, forest-floor litter), and mineral soils were sampled in 14 plots (0.25 ha) that varied in postfire lodgepole pine density (1,500 to 344,000 stems/ha) and aboveground net primary production (ANPP; 1.4 to 16.1 Mg center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)). Counter to expectation, foliar N concentrations in lodgepole pine current-year and composite needles (1.33 and 1.11\% N, respectively) had not changed over time. Further, all measured ecosystem N pools increased substantially: foliar N increased to 89 kg N/ha (+93\%), O-horizon N increased to 39 kg N/ha (+38\%), and mineral soil percent total N (0-15 cm) increased to 0.08\% (+33\%). Inorganic N availability also increased to 0.69 mu g N center dot{[}g resin](-1)center dot d(-1) (+165\%). Thus, soil N did not decline as live biomass N pools increased. Among stands, biomass N pools at postfire year 25 remained strongly influenced by early postfire tree density: foliar and litterfall N concentrations declined with lodgepole pine density and ANPP, but the foliar N pool increased. Lodgepole pine ANPP correlated negatively with annual resin-sorbed N, and we found no indication of widespread N limitation. The large increases in N pools cannot be explained by atmospheric N deposition or presence of known N fixers. These results suggest an unmeasured N source and are consistent with recent reports of N fixation in young lodgepole pine.

AB  - The role of mycorrhizal symbiosis as a control of the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen in soils and in the nitrogen nutrition of plants is considered. The contribution of ericoid mycorrhiza (ErM) and ectomycorrhiza (EcM) to nitrogen (N) supply of host plants is well known, whereas the role of arbuscular mycorrhiza (ArM) is insufficiently understood. Exoenzymes released into the soil from the ErM and EcM mycelium favor the hydrolysis of high-molecular-weight N-containing organic compounds of plant litter and soils to or amino acids that are then transported toward plant roots and are absorbed by them. ArM-producing fungi have a limited capacity to release hydrolytic enzymes capable to decompose high-molecular-weight organic compounds into the soil (or do not have it at all). Therefore, they are specialized on the absorption of inorganic forms of N and amino acids appearing in the soil in the course of decomposition of high-molecular-weight N-containing compounds by saprotrophic microorganisms. The activity of hydrolytic exoenzymes and the role of mycorrhiza in the nitrogen nutrition of plants become more significant under conditions of the low supply with mineral N compounds and decrease upon the rise in availability of mineral Ncompounds. At the same time, mycorrhizal fungi and host plants may compete for the limited resource. The isotopic composition of N in plants (N-15) and the fractionation of N-15 isotope between the mycorrhizal fungi and host plants are considered indicative of the participation of mycorrhiza in the nitrogen nutrition of plants.

AB  - The temporal dynamics of soil bacterial communities are understudied, but such understanding is critical to elucidating the drivers of community variation. The goal of this study was to characterize how soil bacterial communities vary across diurnal, sub-seasonal and seasonal time-scales in a 5.8 m(2) plot and test the hypothesis that bacterial diversity varies on each of these scales. We used 16S rDNA gene amplicon sequencing to quantify the alpha and beta diversity of soil bacteria as well as the Net Relatedness Index and Nearest Taxon Indices to assess the degree of phylogenetic clustering, and the extent to which community shifts were driven by stochastic vs. deterministic limitation. We found that species richness was highest in winter, lowest in fall and that communities were compositionally distinct across seasons. There was no evidence of diurnal-scale shifts; the finest temporal scale over which community shifts were detected using our DNA-based analysis was between sampling dates separated by 6 weeks. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that seasonal-scale differences in community composition were the result of environmental filtering and homogeneous selection. Our findings provide insight into temporal variation of soil bacterial communities across the hourly to seasonal scales while minimizing the potential confounding effect of spatial variation. Soil bacterial communities are distinct across the four seasons and at the sub-seasonal scale, but not the dirunal-scale, in a temperate deciduous forest.

AB  - Boreal forest soils retain significant amounts of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in purely organic layers, but the regulation of organic matter turnover and the relative importance of leaf litter and root-derived inputs are not well understood. We combined bomb C-14 dating of organic matter with stable isotope profiling for Bayesian parameterization of an organic matter sequestration model. C and N dynamics were assessed across annual depth layers (cohorts), together representing 256 yr of organic matter accumulation. Results were related to ecosystem fertility (soil inorganic N, pH and litter C:N). Root-derived C was estimated to decompose two to 10 times more slowly than leaf litter, but more rapidly in fertile plots. The amounts of C and N per cohort declined during the initial 20 yr of decomposition, but, in older material, the amount of N per cohort increased, indicating N retention driven by root-derived C. The dynamics of root-derived inputs were more important than leaf litter dynamics in regulating the variation in organic matter accumulation along a forest fertility gradient. N retention in the rooting zone combined with impeded mining for N in less fertile ecosystems provides evidence for a positive feedback between ecosystem fertility and organic matter turnover.

AB  - Fungi play important regulatory roles in terrestrial ecosystem functioning. However, fungal diversity and community composition in forests along gradients of plant communities at a regional scale remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the determinants of the litter fungi community by sampling along edaphic and floristic gradients across five forest sites on Purple Mountain in Nanjing, China. Illumina sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 region was used for fungal identification. We examined the effects of vegetation type on the taxonomic and functional structure of the fungal community in litter. Fungal taxonomic and functional diversity were each significantly positively correlated with tree diversity and soil carbon content, negatively related to soil pH. At the regional scale, litter resources and tree species more strongly affected the diversity of fungi than did tree species richness. Our study suggests a predominant effect of plant diversity in conjunction with nutrient resources and edaphic conditions on litter fungal communities in subtropical ecosystems.

AB  - Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) is a hydrophobic glycoprotein that can protect soil organic carbon (SOC) from decomposition by promoting the formation of soil aggregates. Few studies, however, have evaluated the response of aggregate-associated SOC and GRSP to freeze-thaw cycles (FTs) under different patterns of vegetation restoration. Soil samples were collected from three typical natural-succession grasslands (dominated by Artemisia capalaris, A. sacrorum, and Bothriochloa ischaemum) and a Chinese pine (Pains tabuliformis) forest before and after natural FTs during a winter-spring season on the Loess Plateau in China. The soil aggregate stability and concentrations of SOC, easily extractable GRSP (EE-GRSP) and total GRSP (T-GRSP) in different aggregate fractions were measured. The FTs decreased the proportion of > 5.0 mm wet-sieved fractions, increased the proportion of < 0.25 mm wet-sieved fractions, and decreased the mean weight diameters by 8.7, 9.5, 2.9, and 9.4\% in the soils of A. capiilaris, A. sacrorum, B. ischaemum, and P. tabuliformis, respectively. The SOC, T-GRSP, and EE-GRSP concentrations in each aggregate fraction generally decreased after FTs in the four vegetation types. The SOC, T-GRSP, and EE-GRSP concentrations did not differ significantly in the larger aggregate fractions before the FTs in the soils for B. ischaemum and P. tabuliformis, but their concentrations were significantly higher for B. ischaemum than P. tabuliformis after FTs. The SOC and GRSP concentrations were significantly and linearly correlated in most aggregate fractions both before and after the FTs. These results indicated that the FTs decreased SOC by decreasing the GRSP concentration in each aggregate fraction and that SOC was more sensitive to FTs in forest than in natural-succession grassland.

AB  - Tropical secondary forests currently represent over half of the world's remaining tropical forests and are critical candidates for maintaining global biodiversity and enhancing potential carbon-use efficiency (CUE) and, thus, carbon sequestration. However, these ecosystems can exhibit multiple successional pathways, which have hindered our understanding of the soil microbial drivers that facilitate improved CUE. To begin to address this, we examined soil \% C; \% N; C:N ratio; soil microbial biomass C (C-mic); NO3-; NH4+; pH; \% moisture; \% sand, silt, and clay; and elevation, along with soil bacterial and fungal community composition, and determined which soil abiotic properties structure the soil C-mic and the soil bacterial and fungal communities across a primary forest, 33-year-old secondary forest, and 22-year-old young secondary in the Northern Zone of Costa Rica. We provide evidence that soil microbial communities were mostly distinct across the habitat types and that these habitats appear to have affected the soil ectomycorrhizal fungi and the soil microbial groups associated with the degradation of complex carbon compounds. We found that soil C-mic levels increased along the management gradient from young, to old secondary, to primary forest. In addition, the changes in soil C-mic and soil fungal community structure were significantly related to levels of soil NO3-. Our analyses showed that even after 33years of natural forest regrowth, the clearing of tropical forests can have persistent effects on soil microbial communities and that it may take a longer time than we realized for secondary forests to develop carbon-utilization efficiencies similar to that of a primary forest. Our results also indicated that forms of inorganic N may be an important factor in structuring soil C-mic and the soil microbial communities, leading to improved CUE in regenerating secondary forests. This study is the first in the region to highlight some of the factors which appear to be structuring the soil C-mic and soil microbial communities such that they are more conducive for enhanced CUE in secondary forests.

Relatively small but significant increase in the number and diversity of Oribatida species was observed in O variant for the deciduous trees. Mulching was the soil revitalization method that clearly improved the density and biodiversity of Oribatida species. In total, the investigated area harbored 37 species of oribatid mites. The most effective bioindicator and stimulant of soil revitalization was a common fungivorous species Tectocepheus velatus.

AB  - Saprotrophic basidiomycetes play a crucial role in leaf-litter decomposition, especially in nitrogen-limited boreal and temperate forests. Populations of this group of fungi have been inadequately investigated. We examined the populations of three different saprotrophic species (Mycetinis alliaceus, Marasmius rotula and Gymnopus androsaceus) in forests in Serbia and Montenegro. To determine the distribution of genets at each of the three investigated sites, molecular analysis was conducted using the inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) method. Seven to fifteen genets (genotypes, individuals) were identified on each site and the majority of them were represented by a single sporocarp. The sizes of the genets with two or more sporocarps were estimated to range from 0.3 to 4.0 m. Results obtained in this study suggest that populations of these three species can consist of numerous and relatively small genets.

AB  - Tricholoma matsutake is an ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungus capable of in vitro saprotrophic growth, but the sources of C and N used to generate sporocarps in vivo are not well understood. We examined natural abundance isotope data to investigate this phenomenon. For this purpose, C, N and their stable isotopes (C-13, N-15) content of fungal sporocarps and their potential nutrient sources (i.e., foliage, litter, fine roots, wood, and soil) were investigated from two well-studied sites in Finland and Japan. Our results show that C-13 values of T. matsutake and other fungal groups are consistent with those of most studies, but a very high N-15 value (16.8 parts per thousand +/- 2.3) is observed in T. matsutake. Such isotopic pattern of fungal N-15 suggests that matsutake has a greater proteolytic potential to digest chemically complex N-15-enriched organic matter and hydrophobic hyphae. This assumption is further supported by a significant and positive correlation between C-13(cap-stipe) and N-15(cap-stipe) exclusively in T. matsutake, which suggests common C and N sources (protein) possible for isotopically enriched cap. The C-13 increase of caps relative to stipe presumably reflects greater contents of C-13-enriched protein than C-13-depleted chitin. We conclude that T. matsutake is a typical ECM fungus which obtains for its sporocarp development for both C and N from a common protein source (vs. photosynthetic carbon) present in soil organic matter.

AB  - Forest floor carbon (C) sequestration has been negatively correlated with manganese (Mn) availability, possibly due to reduced efficacy of Mn-peridoxase enzymes produced by Agaricomycete fungi. I examined a soil C and Mn dataset from a podzolization gradient, along with fungal sporocarp Mn concentrations, to potentially corroborate this finding. An inverse power relationship between soil C and soil Mn content across temperate rainforests was confirmed, which provides further evidence of a Mn bottleneck in C turnover. Average Mn concentrations of saprotrophic sporocarps were greater than those of ectomycorrhizal fungi, and displayed a similar inverse correlation with increasing soil C. The absence or limited effectiveness of select saprotrophic fungi across Mn-depleted forest soils may be one mechanism behind impeded turnover of recalcitrant organic matter.

AB  - Increasing urbanisation is widely associated with decline in biodiversity of all forms. The aim of the present study was to answer two questions: (i) Does rapid urbanization in Delhi (India) affect biodiversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi? (ii) If so, how? We measured the AM fungal diversity at nine sites located in Delhi forests, which had different types of urban usage in terms of heavy vehicular traffic pollution, littering, defecation and recreational activities. The study revealed a significant decrease in AM fungal diversity (alpha diversity) and abundance measured as spore density, biovolume, mean infection percentage (MIP) in roots, soil hyphal length and easily extractable glomalin related soluble proteins (EE-GRSP) at polluted sites. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and nested PERM ANOVA, revealed significant differences in AM fungal community structure which could be correlated with variations in soil moisture, temperature, pH, carbon, and nitrogen and phosphorus levels. BEST (biota and environmental matching) analysis of biological and environmental samples revealed that soil temperature and moisture accounted for 47.6 \% of the total variations in the samples. The study demonstrated how different forms of human activities in urban ecosystems of Delhi are detrimental to the diversity and abundance of AM fungi.

AB  - The soil decomposer community is a primary driver of carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. Understanding the processes that structure this community is critical to our understanding of the global carbon cycle. In North American forests, soil fungal communities are regulated by grazing soil invertebrates, which are in turn controlled by the predatory red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus). The presence of these soil invertebrate taxa is known to exert direct top-down control via selective grazing on saprotrophic fungi, with direct consequences for biogeochemical cycling in soil. We investigated whether the removal of P. cinereus would relieve top-down control on decomposer fungal communities in a tri-trophic mesocosm study. Fungal communities were characterized using metabarcoding and high-throughput DNA sequencing. The beta-diversity of fungal communities differed between salamander presence and absence treatments with a strong effect on saprotrophic fungal communities. We concluded that P. cinereus, a mesopredator in the detritivore food chain, exerts a prominent control on the composition and functional diversity of fungal communities in soil through a multi-trophic top-down process. Given their capacity to govern the compositions of soil invertebrates, the activity of these amphibians may be important for regulating ecosystem function and nutrient cycling in temperate forest systems.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations were historically considered rare or absent from tropical ecosystems. Although most tropical forests are dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees, ECM associations are widespread and found in all tropical regions. Here, we highlight emerging patterns of ECM biogeography, diversity and ecosystem functions, identify knowledge gaps, and offer direction for future research. At the continental and regional scales, tropical ECM systems are highly diverse and vary widely in ECM plant and fungal abundance, diversity, composition and phylogenetic affinities. We found strong regional differences among the dominant host plant families, suggesting that biogeographical factors strongly influence tropical ECM symbioses. Both ECM plants and fungi also exhibit strong turnover along altitudinal and soil fertility gradients, suggesting niche differentiation among taxa. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are often more abundant and diverse in sites with nutrient-poor soils, suggesting that ECM associations can optimize plant nutrition and may contribute to the maintenance of tropical monodominant forests. More research is needed to elucidate the diversity patterns of ECM fungi and plants in the tropics and to clarify the role of this symbiosis in nutrient and carbon cycling.

AB  - Although water is a critical resource for organisms, microbially-mediated processes such as decomposition and nitrogen (N) transformations can endure within ecosystems even when water is scarce. To identify underlying mechanisms, we examined the genetic potential for fungi to contribute to specific aspects of carbon (C) and N cycling in a drought manipulation in Southern California grassland. In particular, we measured the frequency of fungal functional genes encoding enzymes that break down cellulose and chitin, and take up ammonium and amino acids, in decomposing litter. Furthermore, we used ``microbial cages{''} to reciprocally transplant litter and microbes between control and drought plots. This approach allowed us to distinguish direct effects of drought in the plot environment versus indirect effects via shifts in the microbial community or changes in litter chemistry. For every fungal functional gene we examined, the frequency of that gene within the microbial community increased significantly in drought plots compared to control plots. In contrast, when plot environment was held constant, frequencies of these fungal functional genes did not differ significantly between control-derived microbes versus drought-derived microbes, or between control-derived litter versus drought-derived litter. It appears that drought directly selects for fungi with the genetic capacity to acquire these specific C- and N-containing compounds. This genetic trait may allow fungi to take advantage of ephemeral water supplies. Altogether, proliferation of fungi with the genetic capacity for C and N acquisition may contribute to the maintenance of biogeochemical cycling under drought.

AB  - Rhizosphere soil C:N:P stoichiometry is useful for identifying the linkage of plant species and soil nutrients, which can be particularly helpful for understory vegetation management of forest ecosystems. There has been limited research on rhizosphere soil stoichiometry, especially for co-existing overstory and understory plant species. We investigated the bulk and rhizosphere soil C:N:P stoichiometry of dominant overstory trees and understory shrubs (Adinandra millettii, Eurya muricata, and Loropetalum chinense) inPinus massoniana Lamb., Pinus elliottii Engelm., and Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook. plantations in subtropical China. Rhizosphere soil C, N, and P concentrations and ratios increased significantly compared with bulk soil, and those of overstory trees were higher than those of understory shrubs with the exception of L. chinense. Rhizosphere soil C:N, C:P, and N:P of L. chinense were not significantly different with those of overstory trees but were higher than those of A. millettii and E. muricata. Soil pH significantly influenced the profiles produced by soil C, N, and P concentrations and their stoichiometries. This study indicated that the difference in nutrient status between overstory trees and understory shrubs was related to shrub species, in which soil pH was the dominant driving factor. Understory shrub species should be considered in plantation management to reduce resource competition among species.

AB  - Nutrient amendment increases plant productivity but the effects and mechanisms on soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and stability remain unclear, especially in nutrient deficient alpine ecosystem. Here, based on an experiment combining nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) input continuously for 15 years, we found that nutrient amendment did not affect total SOC content, but increased mineral-associated C with decreasing soil aggregate stability. Despite increased total phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and bacteria PLFA, nutrient amendment decreased soil enzyme activities involved in C cycling. The C-13 NMR analyses showed that nutrient amendment decreased the aliphaticity but enhanced aromaticity of SOC. Structural equation models indicated that P availability (Olsen-P content) was most related to shifts in microbial community composition and decreased enzyme activities. Moreover, the concomitantly reduced aggregation and increased mineral-associated C were mainly attributable to the decrease of fungal biomass and increase of bacterial biomass. Together, interconnected factors such as increased acidity, aggregate destabilization, microbial community shift towards bacteria, and loss of oxidative enzyme activities could contribute to the overall response of SOC under intensive N and P input. In particular, available P rather than N may re-shape the pattern of physical and chemical stabilization of SOC, shifting from moderately physical protection to highly chemical stability, implicating the pivotal roles of P management in C cycling of alpine ecosystem.

AB  - Fertilizer application has contributed substantially to increasing crop yield. Despite the important role of soil fungi in agricultural production, we still have limited understanding of the complex responses of fungal taxonomic and functional groups to organic and mineral fertilization in long term. Here we report the responses of the fungal communities in an alkaline soil to 30-year application of mineral fertilizer (NP), organic manure (M) and combined fertilizer (NPM) by the Illumina HiSeq sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR to target fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes. The results show: (1) compared to the unfertilized soil, fertilizer application increased fungal diversity and ITS gene copy numbers, and shifted fungal community structure. Such changes were more pronounced in the M and NPM soils than in the NP soil (except for fungal diversity), which can be largely attributed to the manure induced greater increases in soil total organic C, total N and available P. (2) Compared to the unfertilized soil, the NP and NPM soils reduced the proportion of saprotrophs by 40\%, the predominant taxa of which may potentially affect cellulose decomposition. (3) Indicator species analysis suggested that the indicator operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the M soil occupied 25.6\% of its total community, but that only accounted for 0.9\% in the NP soil. Our findings suggest that fertilization-induced changes of total fungal community were more responsive to organic manure than mineral fertilizer. The reduced proportion of cellulose decomposition-related saprotrophs in mineral fertilizer treatments may potentially contribute to increasing their soil C stocks.

AB  - The altitudinal effects on the distributions of phyllosphere fungal assemblages in conspecific plants remain poorly elucidated. To address this, phyllosphere fungal communities associated with Mussaenda shikokiana were investigated at four sites across a 350 m elevation gradient in a subtropical forest by employing Illumina metabarcoding of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region. Our results demonstrated that phyllosphere fungal assemblages with a single host possessed high taxonomic diversity and multiple trophic guilds. OW richness was significantly influenced by elevation. The elevation gradient also entailed distinct shifts in the community composition of phyllosphere fungi, which was significantly related to geographical distance and mean annual temperature (MAT). Additionally, comparison of phyllosphere fungal networks showed reduced connectivity with increasing elevation. Our data provide insights on the distribution and interactions of the phyllosphere fungal community associated with a single host along a short elevation gradient.

AB  - Fungal metabolic rates could increase under climate warming but may be counteracted by mechanisms of physiological acclimation and evolutionary adaptation. We hypothesized that Vmax and Km parameters of Neurospora discreta extracellular enzymes would acclimate to warmer temperatures through compensatory mechanisms. We also predicted that evolution under warmer temperatures would alter enzyme parameters and fungal respiration through adaptive mechanisms. In contrast to these predictions, growth at higher temperature (22 degrees C versus 16 degrees C) increased the temperature-corrected Vmax of three enzymes. The carbon substrate used for fungal growth (lignin versus sucrose) had a much greater impact on enzyme Vmax than temperature. Following experimental evolution, the enzymatic parameters of Neurospora strains did not adapt to higher temperatures as hypothesized; rather, enzyme Vmax values were unaffected, and respiration rates increased. Together, these results suggest that physiological and evolutionary mechanisms are unlikely to counteract soil carbon losses driven by saprotrophic fungi under climate warming.

AB  - Most tree roots on Earth form a symbiosis with either ecto- or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Nitrogen fertilization is hypothesized to favor arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species at the expense of ectomycorrhizal species due to differences in fungal nitrogen acquisition strategies, and this may alter soil carbon balance, as differences in forest mycorrhizal associations are linked to differences in soil carbon pools. Combining nitrogen deposition data with continental-scale US forest data, we show that nitrogen pollution is spatially associated with a decline in ectomycorrhizal vs. arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. Furthermore, nitrogen deposition has contrasting effects on arbuscular vs. ectomycorrhizal demographic processes, favoring arbuscular mycorrhizal trees at the expense of ectomycorrhizal trees, and is spatially correlated with reduced soil carbon stocks. This implies future changes in nitrogen deposition may alter the capacity of forests to sequester carbon and offset climate change via interactions with the forest microbiome.

AB  - Understanding how soil processes, belowground plant and fungal species composition, and nutrient cycles are altered by disturbances is essential for understanding the role forests play in mitigating global climate change. Here we ask: How are root and fungal communities altered in a mid-successional forest during shifts in dominant tree species composition? This study utilizes the Forest Accelerated Succession ExperimenT (FASET) at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) as a platform for addressing this question. FASET consists of a 39-ha treatment in which all mature early successional aspen (Populus spp.) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) were killed by stem-girdling in 2008. Four years after girdling, neither overall fungal diversity indices, plant diversity indices, nor root biomass differed between girdled (treated) and non-girdled (reference) stands. However, experimental advancement of succession by removal of aspen and birch resulted in 1) a shift in fungal functional groups, with significantly less ectomycorrhizal fungi, 2) a trend toward less arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and 3) a significant increase in the proportion of saprotrophs in girdled stands. In addition to shifts in functional groups between treated and untreated stands, ectomycorrhizal fungi proportions were negatively correlated with NH4+ and total dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in soil. This research illustrates the propensity for disturbances in forest ecosystems to shift fungal community composition, which has implications for carbon storage and nutrient cycling in soils under future climate scenarios.

AB  - Human-driven increases in bioavailable nitrogen over the last century have revealed the critical need to understand how nitrogen availability influences terrestrial ecosystems. In contrast to widespread evidence that increasing inorganic nitrogen strongly influences the diversity and composition of plant and microbial communities, the effect of organic nitrogen addition, the predominant form of nitrogen in soils, remains less clear. In this study, we conducted a field experiment manipulating both the amount and composition of soil organic nitrogen present in soil fungal in-growth bags, followed by molecular characterization of fungal communities after a four-month incubation. Saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi readily colonized experimental in-growth bags, indicating a broad overlap in the fundamental niches of these two functional guilds. Increases in labile forms of organic nitrogen resulted in sharp declines in species richness and diversity across fungal guilds, as well as notable shifts in fungal community composition. The relative abundance of fungi classified as molds and yeasts peaked where organic nitrogen was both high and most labile, whereas slower-growing saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi were more abundant in the non-amended treatments. Taken together, our results indicate that similar to inorganic nitrogen, increasing the amount of organic nitrogen can dramatically alter the richness and composition of fungal communities in temperate forest soils.

AB  - Common ecological restoration treatments such as thinning trees and prescribed burning could result in changes to soil fungal communities and changes to the function of those communities. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are especially likely to be affected as they are symbionts on plant roots and exhibit host and niche preferences. Ectomycorrhizal fungi also produce extracellular enzymes that are important in soil nutrient cycling. We conducted a community survey of ectomycorrhizal fungi and assayed ectomycorrhizal root tip enzyme activity using substrate plugs in northern Mississippi upland oak-pine woodland plots differing in restoration history to explore the influence of woodland restoration on ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition and function. Restoration treatment was significant in explaining the occurrence of the most common fungal species (Russula xerampelina) and the most common family (Thelephoraceae) in the ectomycorrhizal fungal community survey. Highest potential laccase, peroxidase, and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase enzyme activity were found in a prescribed burn plot, and the lowest enzyme activities at a wildfire plot, where richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi was also lower. Different fungal families displayed significantly different enzymatic capabilities, with Hydnangiaceae having the highest laccase activity and Tuberaceae having significantly higher peroxidase and chitinase activity than several other families. These results suggest that restoration treatments can affect ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition and function, and better understanding these changes can aid understanding of the niches of ectomycorrhizal fungi and the impacts of restoration.

To illustrate the value of doing so, we highlight six insights of one of the most influential mycorrhiza researchers of the twentieth century, Jack Harley. These insights concerning mycotrophy, the new niche, the sheath, C cycling, N cycling, and mutualism were published prior to 1975 and so may have escaped the notice of many. but they laid the groundwork for some of the most important research of today.

AB  - The upper canopy of some rain forests in New Caledonia is dominated by single species. These monodominants are commonly secondary species, their dominance not persisting without disturbance. We tested whether dominance is associated with efficient uptake and use of nutrients (N, P and K), comparing between seedlings of monodominants (Nothofagus spp., Arillastrum gummiferum and Cerberiopsis candelabra) and 14 subordinates, grown in a nursery house. We also tested whether this trend applies more broadly to shade-intolerant trees that regenerate episodically (ER species) versus shade-tolerant trees that regenerate continuously (CR species). In the sun treatment, monodominants had higher photosynthetic nutrient-use efficiency and productivity for N and K, and uptake efficiency for N, P and K, than subordinates; ER species had higher photosynthetic nutrient-use efficiency for N, P and K, and uptake efficiency for N and P, than CR species. Uptake efficiency and productivity per nutrient mass were uncorrelated across species, yet Nothofagus spp., A. gummiferum and C. candelabra combined high levels of both traits for N, and Nothofagus spp. and A. gummiferum combined moderate to high levels for P, in sun-grown seedlings. This trait combination may contribute substantially to competitiveness and post-disturbance dominance on these nutrient-poor soils.

AB  - Knowledge on the diversity and ecology of microfungi associated with soil-dwelling mites is rather limited. To get insights into associations between the two highly diverse groups, we studied composition and potential function of mite-associated fungal communities occurring in soil. Two different mite species living in temperate region pine forest soil were screened for associated fungi. The fungal community was assessed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses in a predatory (Leptogamasus obesus) and a predominantly saprobic (Oppiella subpectinata) mite species as well as in the organic soil layer. Key fungi were identified by sequencing, and community composition was exemplarily compared between the RFLP and a 454 metabarcoding approach. Composition of the fungal communities differed between mite species and between mites and organic soil layer. The mites were predominantly associated with Zygomycota, less frequently with Ascomycota, and rarely with Basidiomycota. The bulk soil was colonized by roughly equal proportions of the three phyla. Fungal taxa being known to exhibit chitinolytic activity were predominantly restricted to mites. Compositional and functional differences between the communities suggest that mites represent a particular microhabitat for fungi, the ``acarosphere.{''} This mobile habitat may contribute to nutrient cycling by combining fungal and animal decomposition activities and serve as vector for soil-inhabiting fungi.

AB  - While we know that understory vegetation affects the soil microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activities in subtropical Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) forests, we are less certain about the degree of its influence. We determined the degree to which the soil abiotic and biotic properties, such as PLFAs and extracellular enzyme activities, were controlled by understory vegetation. We established a paired treatment in a subtropical Chinese fir plantation, which comprised one plot from which the understory vegetation and litter were removed (None) and another from which the litter was removed but the understory vegetation was left intact (Understory). We evaluated how the understory vegetation influenced the soil abiotic properties, the bacterial, fungal, and actinobacterial PLFAs, and the activities of five hydrolases and two oxidative enzymes. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon, soil organic carbon, ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), and total nitrogen contents and soil moisture were 18 \%, 25 \%, 12 \%, 34 \%, 8 \%, and 4\% lower in the None treatments than in the Understory treatments, respectively (P < 0.05). Soil bacterial, fungal, and total PLFAs, and the potential activities of beta-1,4-glucosidase (beta G), beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase, were as much as 24\% lower in None treatments than in Understory treatments (P < 0.05). The specific activities of C-acquiring enzymes were as much as 41\% higher (P < 0.05), and the ratio of C- to N-acquiring enzymes was also higher in the None treatments than in the Understory treatments. This suggests that in the absence of understory vegetation microbes invested more in C acquisition than N acquisition because the carbon (C) inputs were less labile. The negative relationship between DOC and AP shows that DOC is consumed when P-acquiring enzymes are produced. The positive correlation between NH4+-N and beta G suggested the increased availability of N promoted the decomposition of C. More extracellular enzymes that degrade soil organic matter are produced when there is understory vegetation, which leads to losses of soil C. On the other hand, the soil C sink is maintained by increased inputs of C. We can therefore conclude that understory vegetation contributes to C sequestration in Chinese fir forests and suggest that understory should be maintained to sustain soil quality in subtropical Chinese fir plantations.

AB  - During long-term ecosystem development and its associated decline in soil phosphorus (P) availability, the abundance of mycorrhizal plant species declines at the expense of non-mycorrhizal species with root specialisations for P-acquisition, such as massive exudation of carboxylates. Leaf manganese (Mn) concentration has been suggested as a proxy for such a strategy, Mn concentration being higher in non-mycorrhizal plants that release carboxylates than in mycorrhizal plants. Shifts in nitrogen (N)-acquisition strategies also occur; nodulation in legumes is expected at low N availability, when sufficient P is available. We investigated whether two congeneric legume species (Bossiaea linophylla and Bossiaea eriocarpa) occurring along two long-term chronosequences on the south-western Australian coast and grown in a glasshouse at varying N and P supply exhibited plasticity in nutrient-acquisition strategies. We hypothesised that the shifts in nutrient limitation and nutrient-acquisition strategies at the community level would also be found at the species level. Leaf N: P ratios and the responses to nutrient availability suggested that growth of both species exhibited P-limitation in all treatments, due to the very high leaf [}N] of legumes afforded by symbiotic N-fixation. Mycorrhizal colonisation was not greater at higher P supply, and root exudation of carboxylates was not stimulated at low P supply; both were unrelated to leaf {[}Mn]. However, nodule production declined with increasing N supply. We conclude that intraspecific variation in nutrient-acquisition and use is low in these species, and that the variation at the community level, observed in previous studies, is likely driven by high-species turnover.

AB  - The Neotropics are among the least explored regions from a mycological perspective. A few recent molecular studies in South America have shown high fungal diversity as well as numerous groups of mostly undescribed taxa. Through soil metabarcoding analysis we compared richness and species composition among macrofungal communities, belonging to Agaricales, Russulales, Boletales and Phallomycetidae groups, in three elevational forests types in the subtropical Yungas of Northwestern Argentina (Piedmont forest; Montane forest, Montane cloud forest). The aims of this study were to assess richness of taxonomic and functional groups along the elevation gradient and to assess the relationships between environmental variables and species composition in the studied fungal communities. The results have shown rich Agaricomycetes communities, diversely structured among forests habitats. The elevation gradient differentially affected the richness and distribution of Agaricales, Russulales, Boletales and Phallomycetidae. Based on fungal trophic modes and guilds, the gradient also affected the ectomycorrhizal taxa distribution. When considering the basidiomata growth forms (agaricoid, boletoid, gasteroid, etc.), only the secotioid type showed significant elevational differences. Additional analyses indicated that saprotrophic nutritional mode was dominant along the entire gradient, being partially replaced by biotrophic modes at higher elevations. Fungal communities in the Montane cloud forests are most dissimilar when compared with communities at the Piedmont forest and Montane forest, which is consistent with the different biogeographic origins of these forests. DNA metabarcoding sequence analysis provided detailed information on the diversity and taxonomic and functional composition of macrofungal communities.

AB  - Myxomycetes are one of the major microbial predator groups found in detrital food webs within terrestrial ecosystems. They are typical inhabitants of coarse woody debris (CWD). However, the association between fungal communities and the foraging habits of myxomycetes has not been explored sufficiently in the field. Our study aimed to find community relationships between myxomycetes and fungi, a potential prey, on CWD, and the trophic status of saproxylic myxomycetes using stable isotope analysis of their sporocarps. Records of sporocarps present on 184 Pinus densifiora logs during a 3-year period listed 37 species of myxomycetes and 45 species of fungi. Ordination analysis using occurrence data of 34 dominant species (17 myxomycetes and 17 fungi) revealed their dynamic succession during log decay. Fungal dominants were clearly divided into two groups-earlier and later- and the majority of myxomycetes occurred during the middle stages of log decay between the first and second groups of fungal dominants. Species level associations between fungal and myxomycetes communities were rare. Isotopic nitrogen (delta N-15) values of myxomycetes were significantly higher than those of wood-decay fungi, but few myxomycetes showed delta N-15 values higher than those of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Isotopic carbon (delta C-13) values of myxomycetes were not significantly different from those of fungi. delta N-15 values of myxomycetes and fungi and delta C-15 of myxomycetes significantly increased with an increase in wood decay. However, these positive correlations between stable isotope profiles and wood decay disappeared after the values were calibrated by subtracting the delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of sapwood from those of myxomycetes and fungi. While saproxylic myxomycetes have long been assumed to be bacterivous, the results of this study suggest that wood-decay fungi could be an important part of their diet, and their foraging associations might be non species specific.

AB  - Intensified anthropogenic activities will increase rates of nitrogen (N) deposition over the next decades, especially in the tropics. There are urgent needs to know how soil microbial community in N-rich tropical forests responds to long-term N deposition. This study examined effects of long-term N additions on soil microbial biomass (determined by chloroform fumigation), microbial community composition (based on phospholipid fatty acids, PLFAs), and microbial enzyme activities, using an ongoing experimental N additions field in an N rich tropical forest of South China. There were four N additions levels: no additions (Control); 50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (Low-N); 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (Medium-N), and 150 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (High-N). Results showed that long-term N additions significantly decreased microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), but had little effects on total PLFAs. However, elevated N inputs significantly reduced the relative abundance of bacterial PLFAs, especially gram-negative bacterial PLFAs with higher gram-positive bacteria: gram-negative bacteria ratio in N treatment plots. Although N additions did not change fungi: bacteria ratio, the proportion of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased significantly with N additions. Long-term N additions greatly increased bacterial stress indexes and enhanced specific enzyme activity (activity per unit of microbial biomass) involved in carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization. Meanwhile, shifts in microbial community composition and specific enzyme activity were correlated well with soil pH and available N. These results suggest that N-mediated environmental stresses can play an important role in shaping microbial community, and that soil microbes will invest more resources on enzyme production in N-rich forest under elevated N deposition.

AB  - Nitrogen deposition can strongly affect biodiversity, but its specific effects on terrestrial microbial communities and their roles for ecosystem functions and processes are still unclear. Here, we investigated the impacts of N deposition on wood-inhabiting fungi (WIF) and their related ecological functions and processes in a highly N-limited deadwood habitat. Based on high-throughput sequencing, enzymatic activity assay and measurements of wood decomposition rates, we show that N addition has no significant effect on the overall WIF community composition or on related ecosystem functions and processes in this habitat. Nevertheless, we detected several switches in presence/absence (gain/loss) of wood-inhabiting fungal OTUs due to the effect of N addition. The responses of WIF differed from previous studies carried out with fungi living in soil and leaf-litter, which represent less N-limited fungal habitats. Our results suggest that adaptation at different levels of organization and functional redundancy may explain this buffered response and the resistant microbial-mediated ecosystem function and processes against N deposition in highly N-limited habitats.

AB  - investigated how properties of soil organic matter (SOM) were altered after 10 years exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration ({[}CO2]) in a Mojave Desert ecosystem, using plant and microbial biomarkers. We focused on roles of Larrea tridentata, the dominant evergreen shrub which form islands of fertility, and biological soil crusts which have extensive cover in plant interspace. Soils to 5 cm in depth were collected under L. tridentata and plant interspace, and biological soil crusts to 0.5 cm in depth under three cover types, Pleuraphis rigida, a C-4 grass, shrubs and plant interspace. Soil organic carbon contents were not significantly different between elevated and ambient {[}CO2]. However, significantly higher abundance of n-alkanes, a major constituent of foliage wax material, occurred in the elevated compared to ambient {[}CO2] plots in the soils collected under L. tridentata, but no such difference was found in the soils at plant interspace or the biological soil crusts. There was no significant difference in abundance of microbial phospholipid fatty acids between the CO2 treatments in the soils of either cover types. However, neutral lipid fatty acid abundance was significantly higher under elevated than ambient {[}CO2] in the soils under L. tridentata, whereas no such significant difference was observed at plant interspace. These results emphasize important roles of the dominant shrubs in SOM formation under elevated {[}CO2] in arid ecosystems. Elevated {[}CO2] stimulated growth of L. tridentata in wet years, and aboveground litter deposition via senescence contributed to SOM formation in islands of fertility. In addition, elevated {[}CO2] stimulated soil microbial turnover rates in rhizosphere of L. tridentata, which left more soil microbial necromass, a major SOM source. We concluded that responses of dominant shrubs to elevated {[}CO2] can stimulate SOM formation in arid ecosystems, but biological soil crusts may have limited capacity.

AB  - Despite the general appreciation that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can influence decomposition of organic materials, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we investigated whether AMF influence decomposition and change the associated soil bacterial and fungal communities through nutrient acquisition and whether this effect is altered by the level of soil phosphorus (P). We conducted a pot experiment using Medicago truncatula as host plant without or with AMF (a mixture of six species) and with two levels of soil P (4 and 24 mg kg(-1)). Hyphal-ingrowth mesh bags (which excluded roots but not hyphae or other microbes) were used to measure the effect of AMF hyphae on decomposition. Maize leaves dual-labeled with N-15:C-13 stable isotopes were used as the organic substrate. Bacterial and fungal communities were accessed via sequencing of partial 16S rRNA and ITS genes. The results showed the N-15 and C-13 content of the organic matter remaining in the mesh bags under low soil P availability were significantly lower in the treatment with AMF than without AMF. Under high soil P availability, however, no significant difference of N-15 content remaining was found between AMF and non-AMF treatments, while C-13 content remaining was higher in AMF than in non-AMF treatment. Levels of mycorrhizal colonization and (1) N-5 transport from organic matter to the host by AMF hyphae were higher at low P availability than at high P availability, suggesting that the host can acquire more nutrients through the AM from organic matter when soil P availability was low. The composition of bacterial and fungal communities were altered by AMF at both soil P levels. For bacterial community, the richness and diversity were higher with low P availability, especially for the phyla Saccharibacteria and Nitrospirae. For fungal community, AMF increased the richness but not the diversity under low P availability. Together, we show that AMF acquire nutrients from organic matter for host, influence decomposition and alter the bacterial and fungal communities, and that these effects were modulated by the soil P availability.

AB  - The diversity of stipitate hydnoid fungi of the genera Bankera, Hydnellum, Phellodon and Sarcodon was Studied at 92 microlocalities in the Czech Republic in 2010-2014. Their vegetation was documented by means of phytosociological releves. In total, 26 hydnoid species were found. Individual microlocalities hosted 1-6 hydnoid species. Frequent co-occurrence of certain species pairs or groups was revealed. Multivariate analyses were used to test community patterns between hydnoids and vegetation, divided into layers and plant functional groups. We confirmed the hypothesis that vegetation layers and functional groups have different effects on the individual hydnoid species. The occurrence of hydnoids is conditional especially on the dominant tree species. The main vegetation gradient of hydnoid sites is represented by the proportion of deciduous versus coniferous trees. Smaller trees in shrub and herb layers do not play a significant role except for spruce. Some hydnoids occur at sites with a species-rich herb layer, whereas others occur at sites with ericoid heaths and lichens, wet sites covered with hygrophilous mosses, or bare soils only covered by litter. Possible factors favouring hydnoids and causing their accumulation at small sites are outlined, e.g. facilitation, phylogenetic conservatism and alteration of tree dominants during succession. Habitat conditions creating ``hydnoid site quality{''} are summarized including the character of the Czech hydnoid-richest sites. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

AB  - Litter decomposition is a crucial biogeochemical process linking nutrient cycling and carbon (C) storage in ecosystems, but few studies have investigated this process in agroforestry systems, where tree leaf litter is mixed with intercrop residues. A 360-day in situ litter bag decomposition experiment was conducted in three ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) plantation systems (a ginkgo-corn (Zea mays L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) system, ginkgo-rape (Brassica napus L.)-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) system, and pure ginkgo system). Ginkgo leaves decomposed fastest in the ginkgo-corn-wheat system, followed by the ginkgo-soybean-rape system, and the pure ginkgo system. Among all litter species, corn leaves and a ginkgo-corn mixture in the ginkgo-corn-wheat system decomposed fastest and wheat straw most slowly. The Olson's litter exponential decay model showed the same results; approximately 9 months and slightly less than 27 months was required to decompose 50 and 95\% of the litter, respectively. Compared to single-species litter, mixed litters accelerated litter decomposition, except for the ginkgo-wheat mixture. Litter nitrogen (N) loss varied dramatically among litter species during the 360-day in situ incubation. The agroforestry system, litter quality, and mixed effects play important roles in litter decomposition. The Ca content, organic carbon, and living vegetation should be taken into account when studying litter decomposition in agroforestry. Analysis during the litter decomposition process clearly indicated that litter N loss changes dramatically.

AB  - While it is increasingly recognized that ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree species vary in their effects on soil nitrogen (N) cycling, little is known about the mechanisms causing and how ECM and AM trees adapt to this variation. Using monoculture plots of six ECM and eight AM tropical trees planted in a common garden, we examined whether the contrasting effects of ECM and AM trees on soil N cycling could be explained by their differences in plant traits. Furthermore, rhizosphere effects on soil N transformations and soil exploration by fine roots were also measured to assess whether ECM and AM trees differed in N acquisition capacities. Results showed that soil NH4+-N concentration, net N mineralization and net nitrification rates were markedly lower, but soil C:N ratio was significantly higher beneath ECM trees than beneath AM trees. This more closed N cycling caused by ECM trees was attributed to their resource-conservative traits, especially the poorer leaf litter decomposability compared with AM trees. To adapt to their induced lower soil N availability, ECM trees were found to have greater rhizosphere effects on NO3--N concentration, net N mineralization and net nitrification rates to mine N, and higher soil exploration in terms of root length density to scavenge N from soils, indicating that these two strategies work in synergy to meet N demand of ECM trees. These findings suggest that ECM and AM trees have contrasting effects on soil N cycling owing to their differences in leaf litter decomposability and correspondingly possess different N acquisition capacities.

AB  - The family Russulaceae is considered an iconic lineage of mostly mushroom-forming basidiomycetes due to their importance as edible mushrooms in many parts of the world, and their ubiquity as ectomycorrhizal symbionts in both temperate and tropical forested biomes. Although much research has been focused on this group, a comprehensive or cohesive synthesis by which to understand the functional diversity of the group has yet to develop. Interest in ectomycorrhizal fungi, of which Russulaceae is a key lineage, is prodigious due to the important roles they play as plant root mutualists in ecosystem functioning, global carbon sequestration, and a potential role in technology development toward environmental sustainability. As one of the most species-diverse ectomycorrhizal lineages, the Russulaceae has recently been the focus of a dense sampling and genome sequencing initiative with the Joint Genome Institute aimed at untangling their functional roles and testing whether functional niche specialization exists for independent lineages of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Here we present a review of important studies on this group to contextualize what we know about its members' evolutionary history and ecosystem functions, as well as to generate hypotheses establishing the Russulaceae as a valuable experimental system.

AB  - Functional differences between trees with arbuscular (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) partnerships influence important ecological processes including nutrient cycling, community assembly, and biomass allocation patterns. Although most broadleaf temperate forests show both mycorrhizal types, relatively few studies have addressed functional difference among coexisting mycorrhizal tree species. The maintenance of ECM associations usually requires higher C investment than AM, leading to (A) lower root biomass and (B) more conservative root trait syndromes in ECM tree species compared to AM species. Here we quantified the representation and trait syndromes of 14 canopy tree species associated with either AM or ECM fungi in a natural forest community. Our results showed that, whereas species root abundance was proportional to basal area, some ECM tree roots were largely under-represented (up to similar to 33\%). Most of the under-representation was due to lower than expected root abundance of Quercus rubra and Fagus grandifolia. Functional root traits in tree species were similar, with the exception of higher tissue density in ECM species. Moreover, closely related AM and ECM exhibited similar traits, suggesting inherited trait syndrome from a common ancestor. Thus, we found little evidence of divergent functional root trait syndromes between mycorrhizal types. Cores dominated by ECM species influenced trait distribution at the community level, but not total biomass, suggesting that mycorrhizal affiliation may have a stronger effect on the spatial distribution of traits but not on biomass stocks. Our results present an important step toward relating belowground carbon dynamics to species traits, including mycorrhizal type, in broadleaf temperate forests.

AB  - 1. Mycorrhizal fungi are known for their functional importance in plant growth and nutrition, and because these symbiotic fungi represent a fundamental linkage between plants and soils, they likely underpin a number of biogeochemical processes in ecosystems. However, our ability to isolate and quantify their role in ecosystems has remained a challenge. 2. This special feature presents seven new studies that advance our understanding of how mycorrhizal fungi contribute to ecosystem function. We specifically highlight two complementary approaches by which ecologists are gaining insight: focusing on mycorrhizal fungal traits to target the biological mechanisms that scale up to the ecosystem, and capturing patterns and processes across ecosystems to understand the net effect of complex plant-fungal-soil interactions. 3. The studies in our special feature provide evidence that traits both within and across species of mycorrhizal fungi can contribute to ecosystem processes, and that disturbance from global change and management may result in altered mycorrhizal traits and lead to compromised ecosystem function. From a broader perspective, studies also demonstrate that key ecosystem properties vary over gradients of mycorrhizal dominance and time, suggesting that mycorrhizal effects emerge from complex interactions within ecosystems 4. Synthesis. Employing complementary approaches to the study of mycorrhizal ecology may allow us to isolate the mycorrhizal traits that matter most for ecosystem properties, as well as the suite of ecosystem properties that result from mycorrhizal fungi, thus converging on biogeochemical mechanisms that underpin terrestrial ecosystem function.

AB  - 1. The distribution of mycorrhizal associations across biomes parallels a distinct gradient of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks, raising the question of how mycorrhizal traits relate to ecosystem properties. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) hosts and fungi employ contrasting strategies for N acquisition, which may manifest in differences in soil C and N pools and/or soil C: N. However, cross-biome comparisons are confounded with climatic and edaphic gradients as well as phylogenetic and functional trait distributions of component plant species. Here, we test emerging hypotheses that soil C, N and C: N are related to the dominance of EM trees within a temperate forest region where AM and EM trees largely coexist but vary in local abundance. 2. To determine the importance of mycorrhizal type on soil C and N, we analysed data from c. 1,000 forest inventory plots in the eastern United States. For each plot, we quantified the dominance of trees with different mycorrhizal associations and accounted for potentially confounding variables including phylogeny (angiosperm or gymnosperm), leaf N, soil clay content and climate. We used hierarchical Bayesian models to determine how these variables explained the patterns of soil C and N in the forest floor and mineral soil layers. 3. Increasing EM dominance was associated with higher C: N across all soil layers. This relationship remained even after accounting for tree phylogeny, leaf N content, soil clay content, temperature and precipitation, which were all important for explaining soil C: N. However, this mycorrhizal pattern of soil C: N was not related to increases in soil C content; rather, increasing EM dominance was associated with reductions in soil N. 4. Synthesis. Our findings are consistent with the proposition that mycorrhizal associations are related to terrestrial ecosystem properties. The mycorrhizal effect on soil C: N may result from differences in how arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plants interact with their fungal symbionts, decomposers and organic matter, to sustain differential cycling of C and N. Alternatively, these patterns could arise from differential success of the two mycorrhizal types in contrasting soil conditions; both processes may occur simultaneously, leading to a self-reinforcing positive feedback.

AB  - Rates of recovery of soil organic matter (SOM) in abandoned fields of Mediterranean Spain are affected by spontaneous succession in the vegetation, the occurrence of periodic wildfires and lack of forest management. Soil organic matter has a relevant role together with the renaturalization process of shallow soil under vines (V) and olive groves (OL), cork oak (S) and pine (P1) trees, pasture (PR), Cisttis (MC) and Erica (MB) scrub in abandoned areas of NE Spain that are sensitive to fire. Physical, chemical, biological and biochemical properties of the soil determined season by season warned against its fragility. Pyrolysis-GC products showed in general moderate to strong positive and negative correlation with soil organic carbon (OC), easily extractable glomalin (EE-GRSP) and total glomalin (GRSP), f3-glucosidase and protease, which strengthens the hypothesis that both less and mote recalcitrant SOM fractions might be inferred and so there is a scale of potential carbon storage in the environments studied. Recently abandoned V and OL soil had small OC contents (mean 2.51 +/- 0.25 and 15.26 +/- 1.39 g kg(-1)) and GRSP (mean 1.04 +/- 0.22 and 2.84 +/- 0.53 g kg(-1)) and large contents of aromatic compounds. By contrast, PR and MB soil had large OC (mean 36.24 +/- 0.75 and 37.66 +/- 2.38 g kg(-1)) and GRSP (mean 4.85 +/- 0.87 and 3.88 +/- 0.76 g kg(-1)) content and smaller contents of aromatic compounds. This suggested a renewal of active OC in older soil. In fact, EE-GRSP and GRSP of more organic soil were positively correlated with the mineralization indices N/O (Furfural/Pyrrole) and O/Y (Pyrrole/Phenol) from active organic compounds (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively), and negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with the humification index B/E3 (Benzene/Toluene) from recalcitrant organic compounds. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified those environments where soil renaturalization is better. Our findings might indicate the potential for carbon storage in different abandoned shallow soil environments under renaturalization in Mediterranean climate conditions.

AB  - Most scientific papers dealing with soil biota do not describe the humus form or even mention the humus type, although it's the habitat of micro-and macro-organisms, and the environment they contribute to create. Traditionally, and to a large extent, even today research into the topic of soil biology is rooted in agroecosystems. The humus context is neither a Mull nor a Moder but is more closely related to the former. In consequence, advance knowledge is poorly suited to the natural humus profile, notably to the Moder way of life, despite the number of studies concerning biodiversity. In this paper, Mull and Moder are taken as examples of contrasting life-styles. These two humus forms exhibit such dramatic differences that they support two different food webs enclosing high levels of unshared species diversity. A spectrum between Mull and Moder can be interpreted as a juxtaposition of hotspots coming from the two humus forms. Such an additive effect may explain much of the soil diversity enigma irrespectively of any other ecological determinants (soil, climate and vegetation).

AB  - Forest mycorrhizal type mediates nutrient dynamics, which in turn can influence forest community structure and processes. Using forest inventory data, we explored how dominant forest tree mycorrhizal type affects understory plant invasions with consideration of forest structure and soil properties. We found that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) dominant forests, which are characterised by thin forest floors and low soil C : N ratio, were invaded to a greater extent by non-native invasive species than ectomycorrhizal (ECM) dominant forests. Understory native species cover and richness had no strong associations with AM tree dominance. We also found no difference in the mycorrhizal type composition of understory invaders between AM and ECM dominant forests. Our results indicate that dominant forest tree mycorrhizal type is closely linked with understory invasions. The increased invader abundance in AM dominant forests can further facilitate nutrient cycling, leading to the alteration of ecosystem structure and functions.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play an important role in litter decomposition. This study investigated how soil nutrient level affected the process. Results showed that AMF colonization had no significant effect on litter decomposition under normal soil nutrient conditions. However, litter decomposition was accelerated significantly under lower nutrient conditions. Soil microbial biomass in decomposition system was significantly increased. Especially, in moderate lower nutrient treatment (condition of half-normal soil nutrient), litters exhibited the highest decomposition rate, AMF hypha revealed the greatest density, and enzymes (especially nitrate reductase) showed the highest activities as well. Meanwhile, the immobilization of nitrogen (N) in the decomposing litter remarkably decreased. Our results suggested that the roles AMF played in ecosystem were largely affected by soil nutrient levels. At normal soil nutrient level, AMF exhibited limited effects in promoting decomposition. When soil nutrient level decreased, the promoting effect of AMF on litter decomposition began to appear, especially on N mobilization. However, under extremely low nutrient conditions, AMF showed less influence on decomposition and may even compete with decomposer microorganisms for nutrients.

AB  - Land-use change in tropical dry forests can dramatically alter soil properties, but little is known about their resilience. We assessed soil resilience by examining resistance to, as well as recovery from, pasture use by smallholder farmers in western Mexico. We measured 25 soil and vegetation properties and compared old-growth forest (OGF) sites and pastures to evaluate resistance to pasture use. We assessed whether those properties recovered to OGF reference values after pasture abandonment by analyzing the trajectories of properties along a chronosequence of secondary vegetation. Finally, we assessed whether recovery of soil properties could be inferred from the recovery of vegetation properties. Nine out of 25 properties differed significantly between the OGF sites and pastures. From these nine nonresistant properties, six (i.e., penetration resistance, soil C concentration, soil C/N, basal area, individual density, rarefied species richness of woody vegetation) showed recovery as a significant positive relationship with forest age. In contrast, surface litter C, litter C/N, and soil available P showed no resistance and no recovery within the successional period examined (up to 35 y). The best vegetation indicator for the recovery of some soil properties was woody species richness. This may suggest that functional differences of colonizing plants matter for recovery after pasture use. Our findings indicate that soil was overall resilient to pasture use, but some properties did not recover synchronously with vegetation properties during succession. Thus, more attention should be paid to soil function, because full ecosystem recovery is often inferred from the recovery of vegetation properties. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The study was conducted in the years 2006-2007 in Biale Blota nursery belonging to Bydgoszcz Forest Inspectorate (53 degrees 06'12.3 `' N; 17 degrees 55'41.5 `' E), Poland. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of mulching with forest litter and organic fertilization (compost prepared from sanitized sewage sludge supplemented with bark or sawdust) on the presence of oribatid mites in the nurseries producing European larch (Larix decidua L.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The oribatid mites were treated as bioindicators of the effectiveness of soil revitalization treatments in in-ground nursery. The study showed a strong positive effect of mulching larch and pine nurseries with forest litter on the abundance and species diversity of oribatid mites. Dynamics of changes in Oribatida presence in this two-year study revealed positive effects of mulching on soil revitalization, particularly in pine nursery and when combined with fertilization with bark-enriched compost. High abundance and growing population of such fungivores as Oppiella nova and Tectocepheus velatus may indicate positive changes in fungal communities. The study suggests that these species may be good bioindicators of soil biological activity in in-ground forest nurseries.

AB  - 1. Woodland ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal species declined considerably in the Netherlands in the late 20th century, mainly due to raised levels of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Environmental measures have been taken to reduce this deposition, but it remains unclear whether and to what extent ECM species have benefitted from these. 2. We hypothesized that ECM species, especially those species that are known to be nitrophobic, that is, sensitive to nitrogen loading, have recovered to some extent from the reduction in nitrogen deposition after 1994. We further hypothesized that, due to legacy effects of deposition, recovery has been stronger in regions where deposition levels have previously been lower 3. To test these hypotheses, we analysed long-term opportunistic data, that is, observations collected without standardized field method. We applied data filtering and a modified List Length method to adjust for potential biases in these data. The removal of bias left us with two periods to examine ECM species trends: before (1965-1985) and after (1994-2013) deposition reduction started {[}in 1994]. 4. We compared trends in ECM species in 1965-1985 with those in 1994-2013. Multispecies indicators were used to summarize the findings of ECM species, and to compare these with results of litter saprotrophic species and wood saprotrophic and wood parasitic species. 5. We found that (1) most trends switched in direction from negative to positive after the reduction in nitrogen deposition began; (2) these trends were more pronounced for nitrophobic ECM species than for nitrotolerant ECM species; (3) trends for ECM species differed from those of the other functional groups; and (4) recovery was stronger in the region with a history of lower deposition. 6. Policy implications. Our results suggest that woodland ectomycorrhizal species benefit substantially from environmental measures to reduce nitrogen deposition. Our study is one of few scientific studies to date documenting evidence of success of large-scale (nation-wide) environmental measures. We have demonstrated that opportunistic citizen science data can be used for the detection of species trends, but it is essential to examine and control for potential bias in the data.

AB  - The view that ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi commonly participate in the enzymatic liberation of nitrogen (N) from soil organic matter (SOM) has recently been invoked as a key mechanism governing the biogeochemical cycles of forest ecosystems. Here, we provide evidence that not all evolutionary lineages of ECM have retained the genetic potential to produce extracellular enzymes that degrade SOM, calling into question the ubiquity of the proposed mechanism. Further, we discuss several untested conditions that must be empirically validated before it is certain that any lineage of ECM fungi actively expresses extracellular enzymes in order to degrade SOM and transfer N contained therein to its host plant.

AB  - Fungal Fungi diversity and community composition are mainly depending on soil and vegetation factors. However, the effects of these drivers on different fungal taxonomy and functional guilds remain largely unexplored, especially in subtropical forest ecosystems. The soil was collected from five dominate tree species forests: Castanopsis carlesii, Castanopsis fabri, Cinnamomum chekiangense, Schima superb, and Cunninghamia lanceolata in Wanmulin National Nature Reserve of South-eastern China. Fungal communities in rhizosphere and bulk soil were assessed employing ITS rDNA illumina sequencing. Ascomycota dominated the fungal community and most of them belong to Saprotrophic fungal group. On the genus level, Cladophialophora, Spirosphaera, and Podospora were dominate in soils of Castanopsis carlesii, Castanopsis fabri, and Cinnamomum chekiangense (> 50\% of the OTUs), respectively. Analysis of similarity showed that the Ascomycota and Saprotrophic fungi rather than total fungal community were significantly different among the soils with different dominant tree species. Furthermore, Ascomycota community were affected by soil C, C/N, and total K, while Saprotrophic fungi were explained by changes in tree richness, diameter at breast height and soil available P. In conclusion, our analyses revealed that the effects of dominant tree species on soil fungi are largely depend on different taxonomic and functional groups levels.

AB  - Physical disturbance of soil profiles, even at shallow depths, is a ubiquitous consequence of anthropogenic landscape modification, with short-term impacts on important ecological guilds of fungi. DNA-based methods for surveying community composition are widely incorporated into studies attempting to explain fungal responses to forest ecosystem disturbances. Here we compare fungal community composition between three distinct soil profile manipulations (20 cm depth) and undisturbed control plots in a sub-boreal spruce forest in the Central Interior region of British Columbia, Canada. Fungal community composition differences were tracked by internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) amplicon sequencing, with comparisons drawn using genus-level annotations. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis indicated that disturbed-sample community compositions were similar to controls at 0 months and distinct from controls at 5- and 12-months post disturbance, but did not indicate clustering of samples according to disturbance regime. We used Linear Discriminant Effect Size (LEISe) analysis to identify fungal genera that consistently indicate disturbed or undisturbed (control) treatments across 5- and 12-month sampling times. Four fungal genera (Exophiala, Hyphodontiella, Mastigobasidium, and Umbelopsis) were detected with higher ranges of relative abundance in all disturbance regimes when compared to control plots. Deliberate mixing of LFH into mineral horizon soils stimulated multiple genera that were more frequently detectable in replicate plots at 12 months, when compared to undisturbed and immediately re-assembled plots. Four ectomycorrhizal genera (Amphinema, Cortinarius, Piloderma, and Russula) were identified as strong indicators of control plot soils. A single genus, Capronia, was identified as differentially abundant between stockpiled LFH and immediately replaced LFH. Our results are consistent with declines in ectomycorrhizal fungal abundance and increases in saprotroph abundance previously reported in DNA-based community profiling studies of forest soil disturbance. This investigation demonstrates that bulk soil sampling can be used to evaluate soil-handling regimens to understand fungal community disruption/recovery and highlights LEfSc as an approach to indicator selection in DNA-dependent biodiversity surveys.

AB  - Litter fungal communities and their ligninolytic enzyme activities (laccase, Mn-peroxidase, and lignin-peroxidase) play a vital role in forest biogeochemical cycles by breaking down plant cell wall polymers, including recalcitrant lignin. However, litter fungal communities and ligninolytic enzyme activities have rarely been studied in Neotropical, non-coniferous forests. Here, we found no significant differences in litter ligninolytic enzyme activities from well preserved, moderately disturbed, and heavily disturbed Quercus deserticola Trel. forests in central Mexico. However, we did find seasonal effects on enzyme activities: during the dry season, we observed lower laccase, and increased Mn-peroxidase and lignin-peroxidase activities, and in the rainy season, Mn-peroxidase and lignin-peroxidase activities were lower, while laccase activity peaked. Fungal diversity (Shannon-Weaver and Simpson indices) based on ITS-rDNA analyses decreased with increased disturbance, and principal component analysis showed that litter fungal communities are structured differently between forest types. White-rot Polyporales and Auriculariales only occurred in the well preserved forest, and a high number of Ascomycota were shared between forests. While the degree of forest disturbance significantly affected the litter fungal community structure, the ligninolytic enzyme activities remained unaffected, suggesting functional redundancy and a possible role of generalist Ascomycota taxa in litter delignification. Forest conservation and restoration strategies must account for leaf litter and its associated fungal community.

AB  - Natural disturbances alter the biophysical conditions of ecosystems, influencing patterns of structure, composition, and successional dynamics. Following high severity natural disturbance in forest ecosystems, land managers sometimes employ salvage harvesting to harvest trees killed or damaged by the disturbance agent. Despite its widespread practice, the effects of salvage harvesting on many ecosystem functions and species assemblages are still poorly understood. This study presents the first attempt to document and analyze the effects of salvage harvesting on macrofungal communities following catastrophic wind disturbance. On 27 April 2011, an EF3 tornado damaged forest stands within the Oakmulgee Ranger District of the Talladega National Forest in west-central Alabama, USA. Following the event, portions of some stands were subject to salvage harvesting. In 2016, we established three treatments, undisturbed, tornado disturbed, and salvage harvested, in stands that were dominated by Pinus palustris P. Miller prior to the 2011 disturbance events. Throughout the sample period, 546 occurrences of 84 macrofungal species were recorded. Tornado disturbed areas hosted the highest macro fungal species richness overall. Undisturbed areas hosted the highest species richness for ectomycorrhizal macrofungi. Salvage harvested areas had reduced species richness for both saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal macrofungi compared to tornado disturbed plots. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination and permutational multivariate analysis of variance indicated that all three treatments differed in macrofungal community composition. The results indicated that salvage harvesting following catastrophic wind disturbance has the capacity to reduce macrofungal species richness and fruiting abundance. The reduction in deadwood volume and alterations to the ectomycorrhizal-associating plant community documented at salvage harvested sites is likely responsible for the observed differences in macrofungal fruiting patterns. The implications of reduced macro fungal richness in the early stages of forest development following catastrophic disturbance should be subject to long-term studies.

AB  - As a source of suspended soils', epiphytes contribute large amounts of organic matter to the canopy of tropical rain forests. Microbes associated with epiphytes are responsible for much of the nutrient cycling taking place in rain forest canopies. However, soils suspended far above the ground in living organisms differ from soil on the forest floor, and traditional predictors of soil microbial community composition and functioning (nutrient availability and the activity of soil organisms) are likely to be less important. We conducted an experiment in the rain forest biome at the Eden Project in the U.K. to explore how biotic and abiotic conditions determine microbial community composition and functioning in a suspended soil. To simulate their natural epiphytic lifestyle, bird's nest ferns (Asplenium nidus) were placed on a custom-built canopy platform suspended 8 m above the ground. Ammonium nitrate and earthworm treatments were applied to ferns in a factorial design. Extracellular enzyme activity and Phospholipid Fatty Acid (PLFA) profiles were determined at zero, three and six months. We observed no significant differences in either enzyme activity or PLFA profiles between any of the treatments. Instead, we observed decreases in beta-glucosidase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase activity, and an increase in phenol oxidase activity across all treatments and controls over time. An increase in the relative abundance of fungi during the experiment meant that the microbial communities in the Eden Project ferns after six months were comparable with ferns sampled from primary tropical rain forest in Borneo.

AB  - In this paper we address total glomalin-related soil protein (T-GRSP) as a possible indicator of differences in forest soils related to reactive nitrogen and forest composition. We focused especially on the relationship between T-GRSP (g kg(-1)), soil organic carbon (SOC), and reactive nitrogen (N-r) availability among different categories of temperate forests and different horizons. Our study included 105 sampling sites divided into 5 categories, which vary in elevation and tree species composition (coniferous, deciduous, mixed). We detected significantly higher T-GRSP and SOC in the F+H horizon under conifers. We assume that this observation might be attributed to suppression of decomposition of T-GRSP and SOC by nature of coniferous litter. The lack of significant differences in T-GRSP/SOC among the categories and the positive correlations between T-GRSP and SOC in most of the categories confirmed the strong relationship of T-GRSP with SOC. We found a significantly higher content of T-GRSP in the F+H horizon for all studied forest categories. However, the contribution of T-GRSP to SOC is significantly higher in the Ahorizon, which might be caused by stabilization of glomalin by mineral fraction, including clay minerals or by the belowground origin of glomalin. We found the increase of SOC with increasing N-r in the Ahorizon for most categories of forest. T-GRSP follows this trend in the case of deciduous forests (decid), mixed forest (mixed), and mountain forests (mount). On the other hand, we detected a decrease of T-GRSP with increasing N-r in the F+H horizon of coniferous forests (conif). Moreover the T-GRSP/SOC decreases with the increase of N-r in the Ahorizon of conif, mixed and mount, which points to the higher sensitivity of forest with prevalence of coniferous trees. Our observations have confirmed an ecosystem-specific relationship between T-GRSP, SOC and N-r. We concluded that T-GRSP in combination with T-GRSP/SOC has the potential to reveal qualitative changes in soil organic matter (SOM) connected with increasing N-r.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are important mutualists for the growth and health of most boreal trees. Forest age and its host species composition can impact the composition of ECM fungal communities. Although plentiful empirical data exist for forested environments, the effects of established vegetation and its successional trajectories on ECM fungi in urban greenspaces remain poorly understood. We analyzed ECM fungi in 5 control forests and 41 urban parks of two plant functional groups (conifer and broadleaf trees) and in three age categories (10, similar to 50, and > 100 years old) in southern Finland. Our results show that although ECM fungal richness was marginally greater in forests than in urban parks, urban parks still hosted rich and diverse ECM fungal communities. ECM fungal community composition differed between the two habitats but was driven by taxon rank order reordering, as key ECM fungal taxa remained largely the same. In parks, the ECM communities differed between conifer and broadleaf trees. The successional trajectories of ECM fungi, as inferred in relation to the time since park construction, differed among the conifers and broadleaf trees: the ECM fungal communities changed over time under the conifers, whereas communities under broadleaf trees provided no evidence for such age-related effects. Our data show that plant-ECM fungus interactions in urban parks, in spite of being constructed environments, are surprisingly similar in richness to those in natural forests. This suggests that the presence of host trees, rather than soil characteristics or even disturbance regime of the system, determine ECM fungal community structure and diversity. IMPORTANCE In urban environments, soil and trees improve environmental quality and provide essential ecosystem services. ECM fungi enhance plant growth and performance, increasing plant nutrient acquisition and protecting plants against toxic compounds. Recent evidence indicates that soil-inhabiting fungal communities, including ECM and saprotrophic fungi, in urban parks are affected by plant functional type and park age. However, ECM fungal diversity and its responses to urban stress, plant functional type, or park age remain unknown. The significance of our study is in identifying, in greater detail, the responses of ECM fungi in the rhizospheres of conifer and broadleaf trees in urban parks. This will greatly enhance our knowledge of ECM fungal communities under urban stresses, and the findings can be utilized by urban planners to improve urban ecosystem services.

AB  - Previous studies have revealed inconsistent correlations between fungal diversity and plant/soil properties from local to global scales. Here, we investigated the internal relationships between soil fungal diversity and plant/soil properties on the Loess Plateau following vegetation restoration, using Illumina sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region for fungal identification. We found significant effects of land use types (Af, Artificial forest; Ns, Natural shrub; Ag, Artificial grassland; Ng, Natural grassland; Sc, slope cropland) on soil fungal communities composition, and the dominant phyla were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota, which transitioned from Basidiomycota-dominant to Ascomycota-dominant community due to vegetation restoration. The Chao1 richness, Shannon's diversity and ACE indices were significantly influenced by land use types with the order of Ns > Af > Ng > Ag > Sc, and the total number of OTUs varied widely. In contrast, Good's coverage and Simpson's diversity indicated no significant difference among land use types (p > 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that plant and soil properties were closely related to fungal diversity regardless of land use types. In addition, soil organic carbon (SOC) and H-plant (plant richness, Shannon-Wiener index) were strong driving factors that explained fungal diversity. As revealed by the structural equation model (SEM) and generalized additive models (GAMs), fungal diversity was directly and indirectly affected by soil and plant properties, respectively, providing evidence for strong links between soil fungal diversity and plant and soil properties on the Loess Plateau.

AB  - Background and aims - Many South American ecosystems remain unexplored and neglected as to the occurrence and distribution of fungi. Data about occurrence of sporocarp forming hypogeous fungi in Atlantic rainforests and Caatinga biome are even less frequently published. For this reason, intensive studies on this group are needed. During studies of hypogeous sequestrate fungi in Northeastern Brazil several sclerotium-like structures were encountered in soil and here determined based on phylogenetic affiliation. Methods - The fungal structures in soils were sampled by raking the litter and top soil organic layer at four different forest sites, all located in the Atlantic rainforest or in the `brejo de altitude' (upland wet forest enclaves) of the Atlantic rainforest remnants within the Caatinga biome. Samples were studied by optical microscopy and molecular analyses. Internal Transcribed Spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS nrDNA) sequences (barcoding of fungi) were used to identify some selected specimens. Key results - Among the nine sclerotium samples, four were related to the /trechisporales lineage, three related to /entolomataceae, and two to the /amylocorticiales lineages. Conclusions - This study provides new information about sclerotium-forming fungi occurring naturally in soils and litter layers from native Atlantic rainforests in Brazil. It is a starting point for more detailed and systematic studies planned for epigeous and hypogeous sequestrate fungi. Such studies are needed to understand the distribution, evolutionary affiliations and trophic modes of those fungi.

AB  - Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Plant Health (PLH) Panelperformed a pestcategorisation of Pseudocercosporapini-densiflorae, a well-defined and distinguishable fungal species of the family Mycosphaerellaceae. The regulated harmful organism is the anamorph Cercoseptoriapini-densiflorae (synonym Cercosporapini-densiflorae) with the corresponding teleomorph Mycosphaerellagibsonii. P.pini-densiflorae causes a needle blight of Pinus spp. also known as Cercospora blight of pines or Cercospora needle blight. P.pini-densiflorae is reported from sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America, Asia and Oceania, but not from the EU. The pathogen is regulated in Council Directive 2000/29/EC (Annex IIAI) as a quarantine organism whose introduction into the EU is banned on plants (other than fruit and seeds) and wood of Pinus. The pest could enter the EU via plants for planting and other means (uncleaned seed, cut branches of pine trees, isolated bark, growing media accompanying plants, and mycorrhizal soil inocula). Hosts are widespread in the EU and favourable climatic conditions are present in Mediterranean countries. Pinushalepensis, Pinusnigra, Pinuspinea, Pinuspinaster and Pinussylvestris are reported to be highly susceptible to the pathogen. The pest would be able to spread following establishment after introduction in the EU mainly on infected plants for planting. The pest introduction could have impacts in nurseries and young plantations. Cleaning seeds from needles and removing infected seedlings and pine litter from affected nurseries can reduce the risk of establishment in nurseries and of spread from nurseries to forests, especially given the limited scale of splash dispersal. The main knowledge gaps concern (i) the role of means of entry/spread other than plants for planting and (ii) the potential consequences in mature tree plantations and forests. The criteria assessed by the Panelfor consideration as potential quarantine pest are met. For regulated non-quarantine pests, the criterion on the pest presence in the EU is not met.

AB  - The growing demand for renewable, carbon-neutral materials and energy is leading to intensified forest land-use. The long-term ecological challenges associated with maintaining soil fertility in managed forests are not yet known, in part due to the complexity of soil microbial communities and the heterogeneity of forest soils. This study determined the long-term effects of timber harvesting, accompanied by varied organic matter (OM) removal, on bacterial and fungal soil populations in 11-to 17-year-old reforested coniferous plantations at 18 sites across North America. Analysis of highly replicated 16 S rRNA gene and ITS region pyrotag libraries and shotgun metagenomes demonstrated consistent changes in microbial communities in harvested plots that included the expansion of desiccation-and heat-tolerant organisms and decline in diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, the majority of taxa, including the most abundant and cosmopolitan groups, were unaffected by harvesting. Shifts in microbial populations that corresponded to increased temperature and soil dryness were moderated by OM retention, which also selected for sub-populations of fungal decomposers. Biogeographical differences in the distribution of taxa as well as local edaphic and environmental conditions produced substantial variation in the effects of harvesting. This extensive molecular-based investigation of forest soil advances our understanding of forest disturbance and lays the foundation for monitoring long-term impacts of timber harvesting.

AB  - Tropical forests generally occur on highly weathered soils that, in combination with the immobility of phosphorus (P), often result in soils lacking orthophosphate, the form of P most easily metabolized by plants and microbes. In these soils, mineralization of organic P can be the major source for orthophosphate. Both plants and microbes encode for phosphatases capable of mineralizing a range of organic P compounds. However, the activity of these enzymes depends on several edaphic factors including P availability, tree species, and microbial communities. Thus, phosphatase activity in both roots and the root microbial community constitute an important role in P mineralization and P nutrient dynamics that are not well studied in tropical forests. To relate phosphatase activity of roots and bacteria in tropical forests, we measured phosphatase activity in roots and bacterial isolates as well as bacterial community composition from the rhizosphere. Three forests in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico were selected to represent a range of soil P availability as measured using the resin P method. Within each site, a minimum of three tree species were chosen to sample. Root and bacterial phosphatase activity were both measured using a colorimetric assay with para-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate for the phosphomonoesterase enzyme. Both root and bacterial phosphatase were chiefly influenced by tree species. Though tree species was the only significant factor in root phosphatase activity, there was a negative trend between soil P availability and phosphatase activity in linear regressions of average root phosphatase and resin P. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance of bacterial community composition based on 16S amplicon sequencing indicated that bacterial composition was strongly controlled by soil P availability (p-value < 0.05). These results indicate that although root and bacterial phosphatase activity were influenced by tree species; bacterial community composition was chiefly influenced by P availability. Although the sample size is limited given the tremendous diversity of tropical forests, our study indicates the importance of roots and bacterial function to understanding phosphatase activity. Future work will broaden the diversity of tree species and microbial members sampled to provide insight into P mineralization and model representation of tropical forests.

AB  - The nitrate to ammonium ratios in nitrogen (N) compounds in wet atmospheric deposits have increased over the recent past, which is a cause for some concern as the individual effects of nitrate and ammonium deposition on the biomass of different soil microbial communities and enzyme activities are still poorly defined. We established a field experiment and applied ammonium (NH4Cl) and nitrate (NaNO3) at monthly intervals over a period of 4 years. We collected soil samples from the ammonium and nitrate treatments and control plots in three different seasons, namely spring, summer, and fall, to evaluate the how the biomass of different soil microbial communities and enzyme activities responded to the ammonium (NH4Cl) and nitrate (NaNO3) applications. Our results showed that the total contents of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) decreased by 24 and 11\% in the ammonium and nitrate treatments, respectively. The inhibitory effects of ammonium on Gram-positive bacteria (G(+)) and bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) PLFA contents ranged from 14 to 40\% across the three seasons. We also observed that the absolute activities of C, N, and P hydrolyses and oxidases were inhibited by ammonium and nitrate, but that nitrate had stronger inhibitory effects on the activities of acid phosphatase (AP) than ammonium. The activities of N-acquisition specific enzymes (enzyme activities normalized by total PLFA contents) were about 21 and 43\% lower in the ammonium and nitrate treatments than in the control, respectively. However, the activities of P-acquisition specific enzymes were about 19\% higher in the ammonium treatment than in the control. Using redundancy analysis (RDA), we found that the measured C, N, and P hydrolysis and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities were positively correlated with the soil pH and ammonium contents, but were negatively correlated with the nitrate contents. The PLFA biomarker contents were positively correlated with soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total N contents, but were negatively correlated with the ammonium contents. The soil enzyme activities varied seasonally, and were highest in March and lowest in October. In contrast, the contents of the microbial PLFA biomarkers were higher in October than in March and June. Ammonium may inhibit the contents of PLFA biomarkers more strongly than nitrate because of acidification. This study has provided useful information about the effects of ammonium and nitrate on soil microbial communities and enzyme activities.

AB  - Ectomycorrhiza is a mutualistic symbiosis of paramount importance in the functioning of forest ecosystems. Therefore, inoculation with ectomycorrhizal fungi, particularly edible species, has gained enormous relevance in the production of forest trees with economic importance. However, due to technical difficulties for the cultivation of ectomycorrhizal basidiomata associated with their host trees, factors influencing basidiomata formation have not been fully understood. This study evaluated the effect of two light wavelengths on the production of basidiomata of two edible ectomycorrhizal mushroom species (Hebeloma leucosarx and Laccaria bicolor) associated with two neo-tropical trees, Pinus montezumae and Pinus greggii. The two fungal species evaluated are widely used as food and sold in traditional markets in Mexico. In general, the type of light differentially influenced the basidioma formation of these fungi in association with host seedlings in greenhouse during six years. Increased basidioma formation of H. leucosarx was observed associated with trees growing in pots covered with yellow filters with a wavelength of similar to 590 nm compared with those covered with red filters with a wavelength of similar to 660 nm. Meanwhile, the opposite trend was observed in basidiomata of L. bicolor. The host tree species influenced the formation of basidiomata. Hebeloma leucosarx produced more basidiomata in association with P. montezumae than with P. greggii. In addition, a description of basidiomata formation from very young stages previous to senescence is provided for both mycobionts. To our knowledge, this is the first record of the effect of light wavelengths on the production of basidiomata of edible ectomycorrhizal mushrooms, demonstrating that this phenomenon is more complex than previously believed.

AB  - It has been predicted that the precipitation and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition will increase in northern China. Though a variety of publications have documented the effects of increased precipitation and N deposition on aboveground plant community, the responses of soil microbial community composition and function to these possible global changes still remain largely unknown. In this study, we take advantage of a long-term (9-year) field experiment that was established in a typical steppe in Inner Mongolia, China. The responses of microbial community composition and soil enzymatic activities to simulated N deposition and increased precipitation were examined. It was found that the low level of N addition showed no influence on the relative abundance of bacteria, but the relatively high N deposition increased the relative abundance of bacteria. The increased precipitation in combination with N addition, estimated at all N levels, significantly decreased the relative abundance of fungi and fungi/bacteria ratio. Increased precipitation played important roles in enhancing microbial activity in this semi-arid region. It was observed that water supply increased the activities of the five of the enzymes determined, including peroxidase (PER), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), beta-Glucosidase (BG), protease (PRO) and alkaline phosphomonoesterase (alkaline PME). The activity of cellulase was reduced by long-term increased precipitation treatment, but was stimulated by simulated N deposition, which may due to the changes in litter components under projected climate change. The influences of N deposition on the microbial enzymatic activities might be alleviated (such as PER), strengthened (acid PME), or not affected by the projected precipitation increment. We also found that the overall changes in soil enzymatic activity patterns are more sensitive to environmental changes than the variations in soil microbial community composition, which may be explained by the microbial function redundancy and the limitations of research method. By all accounts, in future scenarios of increased precipitation in combination with N deposition, the proportion of soil fungi would be reduced, and the microbial community composition might be shifted to be bacteria-dominant. We also predicted that with the increasing of N deposition level, the activities of cellulolase would be enhanced, whereas the activities of ligninolytic enzymes (PER and PPO) would be reduced sharply.

AB  - Effects of biodiversity on productivity are more likely to be expressed when there is greater potential for niche complementarity. In soil, chemically complex pools of nutrient resources should provide more opportunities for niche complementarity than chemically simple pools. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal genotypes can exhibit substantial variation in nutrient acquisition traits and are key components of soil biodiversity. Here, we tested the hypothesis that increasing the chemical complexity and forms of soil nutrients would enhance the effects of intraspecific ECM diversity on host plant and fungal productivity. In pure culture, we found substantial variation in growth of strains of the ECM fungus Laccaria bicolor on a range of inorganic and organic forms of nutrients. Subsequent experiments examined the effects of intraspecific identity and richness using Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings colonized with different strains of L. bicolor growing on substrates supplemented with either inorganic or organic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. Intraspecific identity effects on plant productivity were only found under the inorganic nutrient amendment, whereas intraspecific identity affected fungal productivity to a similar extent under both nutrient treatments. Overall, there were no significant effects of intraspecific richness on plant and fungal productivity. Our findings suggest soil nutrient composition does not interact strongly with ECM intraspecific richness, at least under experimental conditions where mineral nutrients were not limiting. Under these conditions, intraspecific identity of ECM fungi becomes more important than richness in modulating plant and fungal performance.

AB  - Background: Evergreen coniferous forests contain high stocks of organic matter. Significant carbon transformations occur in litter and soil of these ecosystems, making them important for the global carbon cycle. Due to seasonal allocation of photosynthates to roots, carbon availability changes seasonally in the topsoil. The aim of this paper was to describe the seasonal differences in C source utilization and the involvement of various members of soil microbiome in this process. Results: Here, we show that microorganisms in topsoil encode a diverse set of carbohydrate-active enzymes, including glycoside hydrolases and auxiliary enzymes. While the transcription of genes encoding enzymes degrading reserve compounds, such as starch or trehalose, was high in soil in winter, summer was characterized by high transcription of ligninolytic and cellulolytic enzymes produced mainly by fungi. Fungi strongly dominated the transcription in litter and an equal contribution of bacteria and fungi was found in soil. The turnover of fungal biomass appeared to be faster in summer than in winter, due to high activity of enzymes targeting its degradation, indicating fast growth in both litter and soil. In each enzyme family, hundreds to thousands of genes were typically transcribed simultaneously. Conclusions: Seasonal differences in the transcription of glycoside hydrolases and auxiliary enzyme genes are more pronounced in soil than in litter. Our results suggest that mainly fungi are involved in decomposition of recalcitrant biopolymers in summer, while bacteria replace them in this role in winter. Transcripts of genes encoding enzymes targeting plant biomass biopolymers, reserve compounds and fungal cell walls were especially abundant in the coniferous forest topsoil.

AB  - Intensive land expansion of commercial oil palm agricultural lands results in reducing the size of peat swamp forests, particularly in Southeast Asia. The effect of this land conversion on macrofungal biodiversity is, however, understudied. We quantified macrofungal biodiversity by identifying mushroom sporocarps throughout four different habitats; logged peat swamp forest, large-scale oil palm plantation, monoculture, and polyculture smallholdings. We recorded a total of 757 clusters of macrofungi belonging to 127 morphospecies and found that substrates forgrowing macrofungi were abundant in peat swamp forest; hence, morphospecies richness and macrofungal clusters were significantly greater in logged peat swamp forest than converted oil palm agriculture lands. Environmental factors that influence macrofungi in logged peat swamp forests such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, soil pH, and soil moisture were different from those in oil palm plantations and smallholdings. We conclude that peat swamp forests are irreplaceable with respect to macrofungal biodiversity. They host much greater macrofungal biodiversity than any of the oil palm agricultural lands. It is imperative that further expansion of oil palm plantation into remaining peat swamp forests should be prohibited in palm oil producing countries. These results imply that macrofungal distribution reflects changes in microclimate between habitats and reduced macrofungal biodiversity may adversely affect decomposition in human-modified landscapes.

AB  - We investigated the interaction between fungal communities of soil and dead wood substrates. For this, we applied molecular species identification and stable isotope tracking to both soil and decaying wood in an unmanaged boreal Norway spruce-dominated stand. Altogether, we recorded 1990 operational taxonomic units, out of which more than 600 were shared by both substrates and 589 were found to exclusively inhabit wood. On average the soil was more species-rich than the decaying wood, but the species richness in dead wood increased monotonically along the decay gradient, reaching the same species richness and community composition as soil in the late stages. Decaying logs at all decay stages locally influenced the fungal communities from soil, some fungal species occurring in soil only under decaying wood. Stable isotope analyses suggest that mycorrhizal species colonising dead wood in the late decay stages actively transfer nitrogen and carbon between soil and host plants. Most importantly, Piloderma sphaerosporum and Tylospora sp. mycorrhizal species were highly abundant in decayed wood. Soil- and wood-inhabiting fungal communities interact at all decay phases of wood that has important implications in fungal community dynamics and thus nutrient transportation.

AB  - For 15+ years, a beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) dominated forest on calcareous soil was studied on two opposing slopes with contrasting microclimate in Tuttlingen, Swabian Alb, Germany. The cool-humid NE aspect of these slopes represents the majority of beech forests under current climate, the warmer and drier SW aspect represents beech forests under future climate conditions. The field studies were supplemented by investigations under controlled conditions. The research program aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of plant-soil-microbe water, carbon and nitrogen feedbacks in a changing climate and a holistic view of the sensitivity of beech to climate change. The results of comparative and experimental studies underpin the high vulnerability of adult beech and its natural regeneration on calcareous soil to both direct climate change effects on plant physiology and indirect effects mediated by soil biogeochemical cycles. Mechanisms contributing to this vulnerability at the ecosystem and organismic level indicate a high significance of competitive interactions of beech with other vegetation components and soil microbial communities. Obvious forest management practices such as selective felling did not necessarily counteract negative effects of climate change.

AB  - Both top-down (grazing) and bottom-up (resource availability) forces can determine the strength of priority effects, or the effects of species arrival history on the structure and function of ecological communities, but their combined influences remain unresolved. To test for such influences, we assembled experimental communities of wood-decomposing fungi using a factorial manipulation of fungivore (Folsomia candida) presence, nitrogen availability, and fungal assembly history. We found interactive effects of all three factors on fungal species composition and wood decomposition 1 year after the fungi were introduced. The strength of priority effects on community structure was affected primarily by nitrogen availability, whereas the strength of priority effects on decomposition rate was interactively regulated by nitrogen and fungivores. These results demonstrate that top-down and bottom-up forces jointly determine how strongly assembly history affects community structure and function.

AB  - Root-derived resources are receiving increased attention as basal resources for soil animal food webs. They predominantly function as carbon and energy resources for microbial metabolism in the rhizosphere, however, root-derived nitrogen may also be important. We explored both the role of root-derived carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) for the nutrition of soil animal species. Using C-13 and N-15 pulse labeling we followed in situ the flux of shoot-derived C and N into the soil animal food web of young beech (Fagus sylvatica) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) trees. For labeling with C-13, trees were exposed to increased atmospheric concentrations of (CO2)-C-13 and for labeling with N-15 leaves were immersed in a solution of (CaNO3)-N-15. Twenty days after labeling root-derived N was detected in each of the studied soil animal species whereas incorporation of root-derived C was only detected in the ash rhizosphere. More root-derived N was incorporated into soil animals from the beech as compared to the ash rhizosphere, in spite of the higher N-15 signatures in fine roots of ash as compared to beech. The results suggest that soil animal food webs not only rely on root C but also on root N with the contribution of root N to soil animal nutrition varying with tree species. This novel pathway of plant N highlights the importance of root-derived resources for soil animal food webs. (C) 2017 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Peatlands store an immense pool of soil carbon vulnerable to microbial oxidation due to drought and intentional draining. We used amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR to (i) examine how fungi are influenced by depth in the peat profile, water table and plant functional group at the onset of a multiyear mesocosm experiment, and (ii) test if fungi are correlated with abiotic variables of peat and pore water. We hypothesized that each factor influenced fungi, but that depth would have the strongest effect early in the experiment. We found that (i) communities were strongly depth stratified; fungi were four times more abundant in the upper (10-20 cm) than the lower (30-40 cm) depth, and dominance shifted from ericoid mycorrhizal fungi to saprotrophs and endophytes with increasing depth; (ii) the influence of plant functional group was depth dependent, with Ericaceae structuring the community in the upper peat only; (iii) water table had minor influences; and (iv) communities strongly covaried with abiotic variables, including indices of peat and pore water carbon quality. Our results highlight the importance of vertical stratification to peatland fungi, and the depth dependency of plant functional group effects, which must be considered when elucidating the role of fungi in peatland carbon dynamics.

AB  - In order to understand the relationships between understory bamboo and soil properties, we compared microbial community structures in the soil of a Betula ermanii boreal forest with Sasa kurilensis present and removed using high-throughput DNA sequencing. The presence of understory S. kurilensis strongly affected soil properties, including total carbon, total nitrogen, nitrate, and the C:N ratio as well as relative soil moisture. Marked differences were also noted in fungal and bacterial communities between plots. The relative abundance of the fungal phylum Ascomycota was 13.9\% in the Sasa-intact plot and only 0.54\% in the Sasa-removed plot. Among the Ascomycota fungi identified, the most prevalent were members of the family Pezizaceae. We found that the abundance of Pezizaceae, known to act as mycorrhizal fungi, was related to the amount of total carbon in the Sasa-intact plot. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher, whereas those of Planctomycetes and Actinobacteria were lower in the Sasa-intact plot than in the Sasa-removed plot. Furthermore, the results obtained suggest that some species of the phylum Planctomycetes are more likely to occur in the presence of S. kurilensis. Collectively, these results indicate that the presence of S. kurilensis affects microbial communities and soil properties in a B. ermanii boreal forest.

AB  - Fine-root traits mediate the capacity of plants to acquire soil resources in different environments. This study aimed to examine the changes of fine-root traits when roots proliferate into the litter layer vs. mineral soils, and to determine fine-root trait plasticity of these roots in response to nitrogen (N) addition. A one-year N addition experiment was conducted in a 22-year-old broadleaf Mytilaria laosensis (Hamamelidaceae) plantation in subtropical China. Newly produced fine roots were collected monthly from the litter layer and upper mineral soil (0-10 cm) layer to measure root morphological traits and nutrient concentrations. Fine-root production was determined using ingrowth mesh screens in the litter layer. Fine-root production in the litter layer in the Mytilaria laosensis plantation was 2.6 g m(-2) yr.(-1) but increased 3- to 5-fold with N addition. Significant differences in fine-root morphological traits and nutrient concentrations were found between the litter layer and 0-10 cm mineral soil layer. Fine roots in the litter layer were thinner, with higher specific root length (SRL), higher specific root area (SRA), a higher proportion of fine-root biomass in lower, more absorptive root orders, and lower root tissue density (RTD) than those in 0-10 cm mineral soil layer. Higher carbon (C), N, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) concentrations and lower C:N ratio (C/N) were also observed in fine roots in the litter layer, compared to the 0-10 cm mineral soil layer. Nitrogen addition significantly increased root P, K, and Ca concentrations, but had no effect on Mg concentration. Nitrogen addition did not affect most fine-root morphological traits but did result in decreased root diameter. Compared with the mineral soil, roots produced in the litter layer generally reflected a more absorptive strategy with smaller root diameter and lower RTD and with higher SRL, SRA, and nutrient concentrations which together are generally associated with more metabolically active, but shorter lived roots. Strong responses of fine-root production and nutrient concentrations to N addition also suggest that N may be a driving factor for fine-root growth into the litter layer. Further studies are required to identify the effect of fine-root growth into the litter layer on microbial activity.

AB  - Most land plants acquire nitrogen (N) through associations with arbuscular (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, but these symbionts employ contrasting strategies for N acquisition, which may lead to different stocks of soil carbon (C). We experimentally test this hypothesis with a mesocosm system where AM and ECM tree seedling roots, or their hyphae only, could access mineral soils with C-13- and N-15-enriched organic matter. We quantified loss of soil C and N, plant uptake of N and new inputs of plant C to soil. We found that AM, but not ECM, seedlings reduced soil C relative to controls. Soil C loss was greater in the presence of roots relative to hyphae only for both AM and ECM seedlings, but was correlated with plant N uptake for AM seedlings only. While new plant C inputs stimulated soil C loss in both symbioses, we detected plant C inputs more frequently and measured higher rates of decomposer activity in soils colonized by AM relative to ECM seedlings. Our study experimentally demonstrates how mycorrhizal strategies for N can affect soil C and C: N, even at the scale of an individual plant. Such effects may contribute to broad patterns in soil C across terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - This study examines the diversity and community structure of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Eumycota, and Glomeromycota, as well as the microbial catabolic profile of spruce-fir and birch forest litter from control and industrially contaminated sites in the Middle and Southern Urals. Rare and dominant operational taxonomic units' (OTU) role in contamination-induced community transformation was assessed using Hill profiles and abundance-weighted multivariate analysis of variance. In contaminated sites, OTU loss represented 3-19\% of each group, with Acidobacteria exhibiting the lowest amount of OTU loss. Acidobacteria in spruce-fir forests, along with Actinobacteria and Eumycota in both forest types, exhibited a significant alpha-diversity decrease. Two taxon- and forest type-specific patterns in the spatial distribution transformation were observed in the contaminated sites: increased beta-diversity, which is attributable to differences in the number of OTUs between local assemblages; and decreased spatial variation of dominants. Despite a high proportion of shared OTUs (54-76\%), community differentiation between contaminated and control sites was significant in all groups, primarily due to dominant OTUs in Actinobacteria and rare OTUs in the other target groups. Despite a lack of herbaceous vegetation in the contaminated sites, the least effect of contamination on community diversity and structure was evident in Glomeromycota. Microbial biomass in contaminated forest litter was three to five times lower than in the control areas, though only slight catabolic profile differences were found based on the relative consumption intensity of simple organic compounds in the multiple-substrate induced respiration test.

AB  - Fungal respiration contributes substantially to ecosystem respiration, yet its field temperature response is poorly characterized. I hypothesized that at diurnal time scales, temperature-respiration relationships would be better described by unimodal than exponential models, and at longer time scales both Qio and mass-specific respiration at 10 degrees C (Rms(10)) would show signs of acclimation. I measured respiration on intact sporocarps over the course of several days, and modeled temperature-respiration relationships using exponential and unimodal Gaussian functions. Unimodal models provided a better fit than exponential models. Rms(10) and Q(10) also declined with increasing temperature, consistent with longer term temperature acclimation. There was some evidence of diurnal hysteresis. When exponential models were appropriate, Q(10) values averaged similar to 3.5, and Rms(10) averaged 0.02 mu mol CO2 g(-1) sec(-1). The observed high mass-specific respiration rates, peaked temperature responses, decline in Rms(10) and Q(10) with increasing temperature, and hysteresis could contribute to observed non-exponential and hysteretic patterns in soil and ecosystem respiration.

AB  - Microbial activity in forest soils is driven by the dynamics of ecosystem processes, largely dependent on trees as the major primary producers. Diurnal variation of root activity, seasonality of photosynthate production or recalcitrance of decomposing plant biomass all affect microbial abundance, composition of their communities and activity. Due to low N content, fungi appear to be the major decomposers of complex plant biomass: litter and deadwood and to largely shape associated bacterial communities and their activity. On the other hand, bacteria are important in decomposition of fungal mycelia and N-cycle processes including N-fixation. Microbial activity is also affected in the short term by climatic events and in the long-term by ecosystem development after disturbances.

AB  - Regional and global studies of ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) communities associated with Alnus have made progress in determining the key factors that influence EMF diversity and biogeography. Smaller scale studies provide a valuable complement by relating EMF to environmental gradients and describing how community composition is influenced by competition and niche partitioning. We examined controls on EMF community composition in an 80 y-old Alnus rubra stand. EMF species were identified using root tip morphology and DNA sequencing, and related to soil variables (soil moisture, total C, total N, C:N ratio, PO4-P, soil pH) and to Frankia nodulation using Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) and multivariate techniques. Twenty-two EMF species were identified, including 14 that are new associates of A. rubra. EMF community composition varied temporally and was influenced by Frankia nodulation and soil chemistry. Species co-occurrence patterns suggest niche partitioning and competitive exclusion interact with subtle differences in the soil environment to influence EMF community composition.

AB  - Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) is known as an important microbial by-product which is crucial for preserving or accumulating soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the chemical structures of GRSP and its relationship with SOC using C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in three tropical forests. The three forests, including a planted forest (PF), a secondary forest (MF) and a primary forest (BF), were selected to represent the natural successional process after disturbance in southern China. Results showed that the average concentrations of GRSP were (3.94 +/- 1.09) mg cm(-3) and accounting for (3.38 +/- 1.15)\% of the SOC in the top 10 cm soil. NMR analysis indicated rich aromatic C (similar to 30\%) and carboxyl C (similar to 40\%) in GRSP, and abundant alkyl C (similar to 30\%) and O-alkyl C (similar to 50\%) in SOC. The recalcitrance indexes (RI), as defined as the ratio of sum of alkyl C and aromatic C over sum of O-alkyl C and carboxyl C, was (98.6 +/- 18.9)\%, (145.5 +/- 10.9)\% and (20.7 +/- 0.3)\% in GRSP higher than that in SOC in the PF, MF and BF, respectively. This study demonstrated that the stubborn structure of GRSP probably regulate the resistance of SOC sequestration in tropical forests, especially in the planted and secondary forests.

AB  - Peatlands encode information about past vegetation dynamics, climate, and microbial processes. Here, we used delta N-15 and delta C-13 patterns from 16 peat profiles to deduce how the biogeochemistry of the Marcell S1 forested bog in northern Minnesota responded to environmental and vegetation change over the past similar to 10 000 years. In multiple regression analyses, delta N-15 and delta C-13 correlated strongly with depth, plot location, C/N, \%N, and each other. Correlations with \%N, \%C, C/N, and the other isotope accounted for 80\% of variance for delta N-15 and 38\% of variance for delta C-13, reflecting N and C losses. In contrast, correlations with depth and topography (hummock or hollow) reflected peatland successional history and climate. Higher delta N-15 in plots closer to uplands may reflect upland-derived DON inputs and accompanying shifts in N dynamics in the lagg drainage area surrounding the bog. The Suess effect (declining delta(CO2)-C-13 since the Industrial Revolution) lowered delta C-13 in recent surficial samples. High delta N-15 from -35 to -55 cm probably indicated the depth of ectomycorrhizal activity after tree colonization of the peatland over the last 400 years, as confirmed by the occasional presence of wood down to -35 cm depth. High delta C-13 at similar to 4000 years BP (-65 to -105 cm) could reflect a transition at that time to slower rates of peat accumulation, when C-13 discrimination during peat decomposition may increase in importance. Low delta C-13 and high delta N-15 at -213 and -225 cm (similar to 8500 years BP) corresponded to a warm period during a sedge-dominated rich fen stage. The above processes appear to be the primary drivers of the observed isotopic patterns, whereas there was no clear evidence for methane dynamics influencing delta C-13 patterns.

AB  - The importance of plant litter traits and decomposability for nutrient cycling processes and plant community dynamics through plant-litter-soil feedbacks has been largely emphasized. However, the role of biotic interactions as drivers of intraspecific variability in litter traits remains surprisingly little studied. In this study, we used a large-scale, multi-site network of long-term tree removal experiments manipulating the abundance of a foundation tree species, i.e., Quercus petraea, to assess how plant interactions control intraspecific variation in oak leaf litter traits and decomposability. We studied 19 plots across eight experimental sites covering a large gradient of oak abundance, stand age, and local abiotic context. Oak leaf litter quality strongly declined with tree removal in early forest successional stage. Litter became poorer in nutrients such as N and Mg and richer in secondary metabolites such as lignin and condensed tannins. This in turn slowed its decomposition. Importantly, litter N loss switched from N release to N immobilization. Variance partitioning indicated that oak abundance explained as much variation in oak leaf litter traits as oak age and twice as much as soil inherent fertility. Confirmatory path analysis revealed that the decline of oak leaf litter quality induced by tree removal was most likely driven by a shift in understory plant species composition. Plasticity of oak leaf litter traits to the shortage of nutrient supply related to the development of understory plants competitors with higher nutrient capture and retention ability could potentially explain this response pattern. Our data also give consistent but weaker support that the decline of oak leaf litter quality could be driven by alleviated competition for light among canopy trees and subsequent enhanced crown exposure to light. Overall, our study provides evidence that biotic factors such as plant interactions are major drivers of plasticity in leaf litter traits and decomposability. This finding contributes to the emerging view that phenotypic -plasticity is fundamentally related to biotic interactions for sessile organisms, especially for long-lived and large plant species such as trees. Taking this source of functional diversity into account could help us to better understand plant community dynamics and ecological processes in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - In seasonally dry environments such as the Zagros woodlands (Iran), severe drought stress and lack of appropriate management practices can cause failure of oak afforestation or reforestation. We investigated the effect of soil properties and burial depth on Persian oak (Quercus brantii Lindl.) establishment in different microhabitats resulting from traditional forest practices. Four microhabitats that were based on forest structure were considered for oak acorn seeding: (1) inside old sprout clumps (ISPC); (2) under the canopy of tall trees (UCTT); (3) outside the canopy of tall trees and sprout clumps; and (4) near recent stumps or sprout clumps. Acorns were seeded at two depths (2 and 5 cm), and seedling survival and growth variables were recorded for 4 years, together with soil chemical and biological attributes. Stepwise discriminant analysis showed that a combination of total soil nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, available phosphorus and potassium, litter depth, microbial quotient, metabolic coefficient, substrate-induced respiration and earthworm abundance was the best variables to characterise the microhabitats. With the exception of pH, bulk density and soil texture, these variables were higher in UCTT and ISPC than in the other microhabitats. Seedling emergence and survival were greater at a seed depth of 5 cm than at 2 cm. Seedling height and shoot, root and leaf biomasses were higher in the UCTT microhabitat compared to the other microhabitats and correlated positively with soil nutrients contents and most of the soil biological variables but negatively with soil bulk density. This study emphasised the role of microhabitats in creating a ``canopy effect{''} producing favourable physical, chemical and biological soil conditions. In particular, large oak trees form islands of fertility and therefore are of key importance for successful seedling establishment in forests subjected to intense human activities.

AB  - Fungi provide relevant ecosystem services contributing to primary productivity and the cycling of nutrients in forests. These fungal inputs can be decisive for the resilience of Mediterranean forests under global change scenarios, making necessary an in-deep knowledge about how fungal communities operate in these ecosystems. By using high-throughput sequencing and enzymatic approaches, we studied the fungal communities associated with three genotypic variants of Pinus pinaster trees, in 45-year-old common garden plantations. We aimed to determine the impact of biotic (i.e., tree genotype) and abiotic (i.e., season, site) factors on the fungal community structure, and to explore whether structural shifts triggered functional responses affecting relevant ecosystem processes. Tree genotype and spatial-temporal factors were pivotal structuring fungal communities, mainly by influencing their assemblage and selecting certain fungi. Diversity variations of total fungal community and of that of specific fungal guilds, together with edaphic properties and tree's productivity, explained relevant ecosystem services such as processes involved in carbon turnover and phosphorous mobilization. A mechanistic model integrating relations of these variables and ecosystem functional outcomes is provided. Our results highlight the importance of structural shifts in fungal communities because they may have functional consequences for key ecosystem processes in Mediterranean forests.

AB  - Boreal forest floor emits biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from the understorey vegetation and the heterogeneous soil matrix, where the interactions of soil organisms and soil chemistry are complex. Earlier studies have focused on determining the net exchange of VOCs from the forest floor. This study goes one step further, with the aim of separately determining whether the photosynthesized carbon allocation to soil affects the isoprenoid production by different soil organisms, i.e., decomposers, mycorrhizal fungi, and roots. In each treatment, photosynthesized carbon allocation through roots for decomposers and mycorrhizal fungi was controlled by either preventing root ingrowth (50 mu m mesh size) or the ingrowth of roots and fungi (1 mu m mesh) into the soil volume, which is called the trenching approach. Isoprenoid fluxes were measured using dynamic (steady-state flow-through) chambers from the different treatments. This study aimed to analyze how important the understorey vegetation is as a VOC sink. Finally, a statistical model was constructed based on prevailing temperature, seasonality, trenching treatments, understory vegetation cover, above canopy photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil water content, and soil temperature to estimate isoprenoid fluxes. The final model included parameters with a statistically significant effect on the isoprenoid fluxes. The results show that the boreal forest floor emits monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and isoprene. Monoterpenes were the most common group of emitted isoprenoids, and the average flux from the non-trenched forest floor was 23 mu gm(-2) h(-1). The results also show that different biological factors, including litterfall, carbon availability, biological activity in the soil, and physico-chemical processes, such as volatilization and absorption to the surfaces, are important at various times of the year. This study also discovered that understorey vegetation is a strong sink of monoterpenes. The statistical model, based on prevailing temperature, seasonality, vegetation effect, and the interaction of these parameters, explained 43\% of the monoterpene fluxes, and 34-46\% of individual alpha pinene, camphene, beta-pinene, and Delta(3)-carene fluxes.

AB  - In response to increasing timber demands, extensive areas of secondary forests have been converted to larch (Larix gmelinii) plantations in northeast China. It has been reported that the conversions have led to reduction in soil organic matter and nutrient availability. Soil microbes play crucial roles in nutrient cycling. However, the effects of forest conversion on soil microbes are not yet well understood in temperate forest ecosystems. In this study, the structure and function of bacterial and fungal communities were compared lietween larch plantations and adjacent secondary forests relative to surface litter and two soil layers (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. We found that the impacts of the forest conversion on soil microbes mainly occurred in the top (0-10 cm) soil layer. Soils in secondary forests were associated with a higher proportion of copiotrophic bacteria (Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria). In contrast, larch plantation soil was enriched with Acidobacteria, which are oligotrophs that appear to be well suited to acidic conditions. These differences in soil bacterial communities confirm that the forest conversion resulted in soil acidification and a large decline in available soil nutrient in larch plantations. Furthermore, the results of bacterial functional genes, inferred by PICRUSt, and the results of extracellular enzyme assays indicate that fungi likely dominated soil organic carbon decomposition in forest soils. Sordariomycetes was the most abundant fungal class in soils of secondary forests. The abundance of Sordariomycetes fungi was related to higher levels of almost all enzymes measured, except for cellobiohydrolase and beta-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosamidase. These two enzymes were positively associated with Agaricomycetes fungi in soils of secondary forests. The fungal community in the soils of larch plantations was dominated by the class Agaricomycetes, which was positively associated with activities of both hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes. These results indicate that fungal classes, Sordariomycetes and Agaricomycetes, are most likely responsible for the decomposition of soil organic matter in secondary forests, while Agaricomycetes fungi might be more important in controlling decomposition in larch plantations.

AB  - Globally, forests represent highly productive ecosystems that act as carbon sinks where soil organic matter is formed from residuals after biomass decomposition as well as from rhizodeposited carbon. Forests exhibit a high level of spatial heterogeneity and the importance of trees, the dominant primary producers, for their structure and functioning. Fungi, bacteria and archaea inhabit various forest habitats: foliage, the wood of living trees, the bark surface, ground vegetation, roots and the rhizosphere, litter, soil, deadwood, rock surfaces, invertebrates, wetlands or the atmosphere, each of which has its own specific features, such as nutrient availability or temporal dynamicy and specific drivers that affect microbial abundance, the level of dominance of bacteria or fungi as well as the composition of their communities. However, several microorganisms, and in particular fungi, inhabit or even connect multiple habitats, and most ecosystem processes affect multiple habitats. Forests are dynamic on a broad temporal scale with processes ranging from short-term events over seasonal ecosystem dynamics to long-term stand development after disturbances such as fires or insect outbreaks. The understanding of these processes can be only achieved by the exploration of the complex `ecosystem microbiome' and its functioning using focused, integrative microbiological and ecological research performed across multiple habitats.

AB  - Trait-based approaches have led to significant advances in plant ecology, but are currently biased toward above-ground traits. It is becoming clear that a stronger emphasis on belowground traits is needed to better predict future changes in plant biodiversity and their consequences for ecosystem functioning. Here I propose six `below-ground frontiers' in traitbased plant ecology, with an emphasis on traits governing soil nutrient acquisition: redefining fine roots; quantifying root trait dimensionality; integrating mycorrhizas; broadening the suite of root traits; determining linkages between root traits and abiotic and biotic factors; and understanding ecosystem-level consequences of root traits. Focusing research efforts along these frontiers should help to fulfil the promise of trait-based ecology: enhanced predictive capacity across ecological scales.

AB  - Picea abies, Pinus mugo and Rhododendron ferrugineum co-exist at the alpine tree line, and can have different mycorrhizal communities. The activity and diversity of mycorrhizal fungi are considered to be important factors in regulation of soil function. At a tree line site and a lower elevation site in the Austrian Alps, the community structure of ectomycorrhiza on Picea abies and Pinus mugo was determined. The activity of surface enzymes was determined on ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal roots. In soils, the activity of a range of enzymes, nitrogen (N) mineralization and biomass decomposition were determined. The community structure of the ectomycorrhizal community of Picea abies and Pinus mugo differed strongly, but the average activity of surface enzymes of the ectomycorrhizal communities was similar. A lower root surface enzyme activity was determined on Rhododendron ferrugineum. Soil N-mineralization under Rhododendron ferrugineum was significantly lower than under Picea abies and Pinus mugo. In soil, the activity of a range of enzymes did not differ at the tree line but differed between the tree line and the lower elevation sites. The different ectomycorrhizal communities on Picea abies and Pinus mugo and ericoid mycorrhizas on Rhododendron ferrugineum support similar ecosystem functions in soil.

AB  - Soil biota influence plant performance through plant-soil feedback, but it is unclear whether the strength of such feedback depends on plant traits and whether plant-soil feedback drives local plant diversity. We grew 16 co-occurring plant species with contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies from hyperdiverse Australian shrublands and exposed them to soil biota from under their own or other plant species. Plant responses to soil biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal plants and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal plants. Simulations revealed that such strategy-dependent feedback is sufficient to maintain the high taxonomic and functional diversity characterizing these Mediterranean-climate shrublands. Our study identifies nutrient-acquisition strategy as a key trait explaining how different plant responses to soil biota promote local plant diversity.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) anchors global terrestrial productivity and food and fiber supply. SOM retains water and soil nutrients and stores more global carbon than do plants and the atmosphere combined. SOM is also decomposed by microbes, returning CO2, a greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere. Unfortunately, soil carbon stocks have been widely lost or degraded through land use changes and unsustainable forest and agricultural practices. To understand its structure and function and to maintain and restore SOM, we need a better appreciation of soil organic carbon (SOC) saturation capacity and the retention of above-and belowground inputs in SOM. Our analysis suggests root inputs are approximately five times more likely than an equivalent mass of aboveground litter to be stabilized as SOM. Microbes, particularly fungi and bacteria, and soil faunal food webs strongly influence SOM decomposition at shallower depths, whereas mineral associations drive stabilization at depths greater than similar to 30 cm. Global uncertainties in the amounts and locations of SOM include the extent of wetland, peatland, and permafrost systems and factors that constrain soil depths, such as shallow bedrock. In consideration of these uncertainties, we estimate global SOC stocks at depths of 2 and 3 m to be between 2,270 and 2,770 Pg, respectively, but could be as much as 700 Pg smaller. Sedimentary deposits deeper than 3 m likely contain >500 Pg of additional SOC. Soils hold the largest biogeochemically active terrestrial carbon pool on Earth and are critical for stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Nonetheless, global pressures on soils continue from changes in land management, including the need for increasing bioenergy and food production.

AB  - Decomposition subsystems have an essential role in forest dynamics but few studies demonstrate the effect of microbial decay traits on seedling regeneration. In the present study, we focused on seedling regeneration on coarse woody material (CWM), which is an important regeneration site for forest tree species, and the effects of wood decay type according to fungal decay preference for wood structural components on seedling colonization. Effects of log properties including wood decay type and other environmental variables on seedling density were evaluated by ordination methods and generalized linear models. In total, 22 woody species were recorded as seedlings on Pinus densiflora logs. By ordination analysis, white rot in heartwood and brown rot in sapwood, as well as canopy openness and log diameter, showed significant association with seedling communities. The factors selected for a generalized linear model for explaining seedling densities of the two dominant seedling species Cryptomeria japonica and P. densiflora included brown rot in sapwood and white rot in heartwood, but the effects were different: a positive effect of brown rot on C. japonica and a negative effect of white rot on P. densiflora. These results suggested that wood decay type could induce niche separation between dominant tree species regenerating on CWM.

AB  - Soils are complex ecosystems in which fungi and bacteria co-exist and interact. Fungal highways are a kind of interaction by which bacteria use fungal hyphae to disperse in soils. Despite the fact that fungal highways have been studied in laboratory models, the diversity of fungi and bacteria interacting in this way in soils is still unknown. Fungal highway columns containing two different culture media were used as a selective method to study the identity of fungi and bacteria able to migrate along the hyphae in three forest soils. Regardless of the soil type, fungi of the genus Mortierella (phylum Zygomycota) were selected inside the columns. In contrast, a diverse community of bacteria dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria was observed. The results confirm the importance of bacteria affiliated to Burkholderia as potentially associated migrating bacteria in soils and indicate that other groups such as Bacillus and Clostridium are also highly enriched in the co-colonization of a new habitat (columns) associated to Mortierella. The diversity of potentially associated migrating bacteria brings a novel perspective on the indirect metabolic capabilities that could be favored by r-strategist fungi and supports the fact that these fungi should be considered as crucial actors in soil functioning.

AB  - Biomass allocation to fine roots often increases under soil nutrient deficiency, but the fine root biomass does not often increase in old stands, even under nutrient limitation. Therefore, in old stands, the morphology, anatomy, branching architecture and mycorrhization of fine roots may compensate efficiently for nutrient acquisition by the low fine root biomass. In this study, changes in the morphology, anatomy and arbuscular mycorrhizal infection at each branching position of fine root clusters were evaluated in relation to stand age. A chronosequence (6-90 years of age) of stands in a Cryptomeria japonica D. Don plantation was used for these analyses. The fine root size parameters, such as length, weight and tip numbers of fine root clusters, increased with stand age. The specific root tip length (SRTL) decreased with increasing stand age, suggesting that the allocation to root active portions decreased with stand age. From the anatomical observation, the ephemeral root tips increased with stand age, suggesting that root tip turnover within a root cluster was high in old stands. The proportions of proto-xylem groups among branching positions indicated that the life cycles in branching hierarchy should be clearer in old stands than that in younger stands. The increasing in the mycorrhizal infection of root tips in old stands should enhance the root tip absorptive functions. The SRTL was correlated with the wood/needle ratio, suggesting that carbon limitation as the stand ages may result in decline of carbon allocation to maintain active root tips. However, increasing of the ephemeral tips and mycorrhizal infection rates may compensate the declines of tip allocation in old stands.

AB  - The neutral monosaccharide composition of forest soils differs from that of non-forest soils suggesting there is an accumulation of microbial saccharides. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi can be responsible as the fungi are typical in forest soils. We investigated neutral saccharides of ECM fungal sclerotia to determine what part it might play in the origin of forest soil polysaccarides. Sclerotial grain (SG) was collected from the O, A1 and A2 horizons of a soil of subalpine forest of Mt. Ontake, central Japan. Neutral saccharides in soil and SG were analyzed by two step hydrolysis with sulfuric acid and gas-chromatography of alditol acetate derivatives. Saccharides accounted for 6.0-16\% of the SG by carbon content. The SG contained predominantly easily hydrolysable (EH)-glucose, which accounted for 75-85\% of the composition depending on grain size and the soil horizon, followed by mannose (7.7-15\%), galactose (2.2-4.8\%) and non-easily hydrolysable (NEH)-glucose (1.7-6.1\%). The SG contained all of these sugars irrespective of its size. The SG collected from the A1 and A2 horizons contained all sugar components found in that from the O horizon, except for fucose in that from A2 horizon. The monosaccharide composition of SG indicates that accumulation of ECM fungal sclerotial polysaccharides might have been responsible for enlarging the molar ratios of (galactose + mannose) /(arabinose + xylose) and EH-glucose/NEH-glucose of forest soils. The proportions of SG saccharides relative to soil saccharides were 3.6, 1.2, and 0.83\% for the O, A1 and A2 horizons, respectively. These levels of the proportion are considerable as ECM fugal sclerotia are the products of a limited species among hundreds and thousands of microbial species inhabiting forest soils. The sclerotia forming ECM fungal species such as Cenococcum geophilum may be key sources of forest soil polysaccharides.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the effects of different forest stands (Silver fir (Abies alba) and sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) with common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus)) on the enzymes activities and microbial biomass. The objective was to explore how changes in the detritus inputs affect soil organic matter (SOM) composition. The content of SOM fraction has been compared with soil enzyme activities. The investigation was carried out in the Swietokrzyskie Mountains of central Poland. Twenty investigation plots were selected, including fir stands (10 plots) and maple with hornbeam stands (10 plots). Contents of organic C, N and base cations, pH, hydrolytic acidity, and soil texture were investigated. The content of C and N in the physically separated SOM fractions was distinguished. The study indicated only small changes in soil properties and stabilization of organic matter as a result of different detritus inputs. The maple-hornbeam and fir stands have a similar influence on microbiological processes and the SOM. Acidity of soil is a major factor affecting microbial activity and therefore pH affects enzyme dynamics. Differences in soil pH confirmed the stronger acidifying effects of fir stands compared to maple-hornbeam stands. Additionally, fir stands stimulate beta-glucosidase activity, probably through a simultaneous interaction of mycorrhizal fungi in the roots of fir stands.

AB  - Monoculture rubber cultivation and its intensive associated human activities are known to have a negative impact on the biodiversity, ecology, and biological conservation of the ecosystems in which they occur. These negative impacts include changes to the biodiversity and function of soil fungal communities, which contribute towards nutrient cycling and interact with other organisms in belowground ecosystems, and may be pathogens. Despite the important role of soil fungi in rubber plantations, these communities have been poorly studied. In this paper, we review the existing literature on the diversity and ecology of belowground fungi in rubber plantations. Various groups of soil fungi, including saprobes, symbionts, and pathogens are discussed. Additionally, the role of plantation management is discussed in the context of both pathogenic soil fungi and the promotion of beneficial soil fungi. Management practices include clone selection, tree age and planting density, application of chemicals, and intercropping systems. Our review shows the strong need for further research into the effects of monoculture rubber plantations on soil fungal communities, and how we can best manage these systems in the future, in order to create a more sustainable approach to rubber production.

AB  - Low-molecular-mass organic acids (LMMOA) and their behaviour in forest soil are reviewed. LMMOA are a part of the carbon cycle, and represent an important component of the active organic carbon. Low-molecular-mass organic acids are being constantly released to soil from root exudates, microbial activities, and organic matter decomposition. Other main sources include deposition (atmospheric or throughfall). This review describes the origin of LMMOA in forest soils, and the methods for determination of LMMOA in soil solution and for the storage of LMMOA samples. Methods of LMMOA analysis are discussed in greater detail. Generally, one of the most promising methods for determination and speciation of LMMOA seems to be IC-MS; HPLC is suitable method when strong extraction reagent is used.

AB  - Biodiversity patterns (alpha-, beta-and gamma-diversity, abundance, community structure) of oribatid mites were investigated in six sites in a tropical montane forest in the Central Highlands region of Southern Vietnam. The diversity patterns in oribatid communities were investigated in relation to substrate (leaf litter vs. soil) and forest type (conifer-dominated vs. broadleaf-dominated). The density and species richness of oribatid mites in the soil were greater in the conifer-dominated sites. The community structure was also different between conifer-dominated and deciduous tree-dominated sites. Species from families Galumnidae, Otocepheidae, Haplozetidae and Scheloribatidae were dominant in each plot. In conclusion, density and species richness of Oribatida were influenced by both forest type and substrate, and community composition was strongly influenced by the substrate.

AB  - The relative benefits that mycorrhizal fungi confer to host plants and reforestation efforts may differ due to the host tree species and soil nutrient status. Our research objective was to examine the effects of mycorrhizal fungi, host tree species, and soil nutrient availability on nutrient acquisition in tropical reforestation. Four tree species (Pinus caribaea, Quercus insignis, Swietenia macrophylla, and Terminalia amazonia) were planted across eight sites and subjected to five nutrient treatments in southern Costa Rica. After two years, there were strong growth differences based upon tree species but not mycorrhizal fungi. Site variation, specifically base cation availability, and nutrient treatments also influenced tree growth and tissue nutrient concentrations. In a complementary greenhouse experiment isolating fungal from tree species effects, the ratio of nutrients in treatments was more important to tree growth responses to fungal symbionts than individual nutrients. These results show that soil nutrient availability may be more important to tree species' nutrient acquisition than mycorrhizal fungi. This study highlights the importance of tree species selection and replication across sites with different soil nutrient ratios in order to make management recommendations for reforestation success.

AB  - Swedish boreal streams were modified to transport timber by pushing boulders to stream sides, creating levees that disconnected streams from riparian areas. Many streams have since been restored and our goal was to understand how this affects riparian nitrogen (N) cycling. We compared the natural abundance of delta N-15 isotopes in foliage and roots of Filipendula ulmaria plus soils and litter along streams restored 2-25 years ago. We measured sources of N, potential immobilization of N, namely plant diversity and biomass, and the amount and sources of carbon (C) to determine if these were important for describing riparian N cycling. The delta N-15 of F. ulmaria foliage changed dramatically just after restoration compared to the channelized, disconnected state and then converged over the next 25 years with the steady-state reference. The disturbance and reconnection of the stream with the riparian zone during restoration created a short-term pulse of N availability and gaseous losses of N as a result of enhanced microbial processing of N. With increasing time since restoration, N availability appears to have decreased, and N sources changed to those derived from mycorrhizae, amino acids, or the humus layer, or there was enhanced N-use efficiency by older, more diverse plant communities.

AB  - Western North American landscapes are rapidly being transformed by forest die-off caused by mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), with implications for plant and soil communities. The mechanisms that drive changes in soil community structure, particularly for the highly prevalent ectomycorrhizal fungi in pine forests, are complex and intertwined. Critical to enhancing understanding will be disentangling the relative importance of host tree mortality from changes in soil chemistry following tree death. Here, we used a recent bark beetle outbreak in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests of western Canada to test whether the effects of tree mortality altered the richness and composition of belowground fungal communities, including ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi. We also determined the effects of environmental factors (i.e. soil nutrients, moisture, and phenolics) and geographical distance, both of which can influence the richness and composition of soil fungi. The richness of both groups of soil fungi declined and the overall composition was altered by beetle-induced tree mortality. Soil nutrients, soil phenolics and geographical distance influenced the community structure of soil fungi; however, the relative importance of these factors differed between ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi. The independent effects of tree mortality, soil phenolics and geographical distance influenced the community composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi, while the community composition of saprotrophic fungi was weakly but significantly correlated with the geographical distance of plots. Taken together, our results indicate that both deterministic and stochastic processes structure soil fungal communities following landscape-scale insect outbreaks and reflect the independent roles tree mortality, soil chemistry and geographical distance play in regulating the community composition of soil fungi.

AB  - Our study used a similar to 360-year fire chronosequence in northern Sweden to investigate post-fire microbial community dynamics in the boreal bryosphere (the living and dead parts of the feather moss layer on the forest floor, along with the associated biota). We anticipated systematic changes in microbial community structure and growth strategy with increasing time since fire (TSF) and used amplicon pyrosequencing to establish microbial community structure. We also recorded edaphic factors (relating to pH, C and N accumulation) and the physical characteristics of the feather moss layer. The molecular analyses revealed an unexpectedly diverse microbial community. The structure of the community could be largely explained by just two factors, TSF and pH, although the importance of TSF diminished as the forest recovered from disturbance. The microbial communities on the youngest site (TSF = 14 years) were clearly different from older locations (> 100 years), suggesting relatively rapid post-fire recovery. A shift towards Proteobacterial taxa on older sites, coupled with a decline in the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, suggested an increase in resource availability with TSF. Saprotrophs dominated the fungal community. Mycorrhizal fungi appeared to decline in abundance with TSF, possibly due to changing N status. Our study provided evidence for the decadal-scale legacy of burning, with implications for boreal forests that are expected to experience more frequent burns over the course of the next century.

AB  - Soil microbial communities can form links between forest trees and functioning of forest soils, yet the impacts of converting diverse native forests to monoculture plantations on soil microbial communities are limited. This study tested the hypothesis that conversion from a diverse native to monoculture ecosystem would be paralleled by a reduction in the diversity of the soil microbial communities. Soils from Teak (Tectona grandis) plantations and adjacent native forest were examined at two locations in Trinidad. Microbial community structure was determined via Illumina sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, and by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Functional characteristics of microbial communities were assessed by extracellular enzyme activity (EEA). Conversion to Teak plantation had no effect on species richness or evenness of bacterial or fungal communities, and no significant effect on EEA. However, multivariate analyses (nested and two-way crossed analysis of similarity) revealed significant effects (p < 0.05) of forest type (Teak vs. native) upon the composition of the microbial communities as reflected in all three assays of community structure. Univariate analysis of variance identified two bacterial phyla that were significantly more abundant in the native forest soils than in Teak soils (Cyanobacteria, p = 0.0180; Nitrospirae, p = 0.0100) and two more abundant in Teak soils than in native forest (candidate phyla TM7, p = 0.0004; W56, p = 0.044). Abundance of an unidentified class of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was significantly greater in Teak soils, notable because Teak is colonized by AMF rather than by ectomycorrihzal fungi that are symbionts of the native forest tree species. In conclusion, microbial diversity indices were not affected in the conversion of native forest to teak plantation, but examination of specific bacterial taxa showed that there were significant differences in community composition.

AB  - We conducted an experiment to investigate the potential of phytoremediation by soil amendments in a forest area. To desorb radiocesium (Cs-137) from variable charges in the soil, ammonium sulfate (NH4+) and elemental sulfur (S) (which decrease soil pH) were applied to forest soil collected from contaminated area at a rate of 40 and 80 g/m(2), respectively. A control condition with no soil treatment was also considered. We defined four groups of aboveground conditions: planted with Quercus serrata, planted with Houttuynia cordata, covered with rice straw as litter, and unplanted/uncovered (control). Cultivation was performed in a greenhouse with a regular water supply for four months. Following elemental sulfur treatment, soil pH values were significantly lower than pH values following ammonium sulfate treatment and no treatment. During cultivation, several plant species germinated from natural seeds. No clear differences in aboveground tissue Cs-137 concentrations in planted Q. serrata and H. cordata were observed among the treatments. However, aboveground tissue Cs-137 concentration values in the germinated plants following elemental sulfur treatment were higher than the values following the ammonium sulfate treatment and no treatment. Although biomass values for Q. serrata, H. cordata, and germinated plants following elemental sulfur treatment tended to be low, the total Cs-137 activities in the aboveground tissue of germinated plants were higher than those following ammonium sulfate treatment and no treatment in rice straw and unplanted conditions. Although no significant differences were observed, Cs-137 concentrations in rice straw following ammonium sulfate and elemental sulfur treatments tended to be higher than those in the control case. The results of this study indicate that elemental sulfur lowers the soil pH for a relatively long period and facilitates Cs-137 translocation to newly emerged and settled plants or litter, but affects plant growth in large concentrations and/or anaerobic conditions. Combining elemental sulfur application with forest management practices, such as mowing and thinning, could be a suitable method of decontamination of the forest environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soil microorganisms play key roles in ecosystem functioning and are known to be influenced by biotic and abiotic factors, such as plant cover or edaphic parameters. New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot located in the southwest Pacific, is one-third covered by ultramafic substrates. These types of soils are notably characterised by low nutrient content and high heavy metal concentrations. Ultramafic outcrops harbour diverse vegetation types and remarkable plant diversity. In this study, we aimed to assess soil bacterial and fungal diversity in New Caledonian ultramafic substrates and to determine whether floristic composition, edaphic parameters and geographical factors affect this microbial diversity. Therefore, four plant formation types at two distinct sites were studied. These formations represent different stages in a potential chronosequence. Soil cores, according to a given sampling procedure, were collected to assess microbial diversity using a metagenomic approach, and to characterise the physico-chemical parameters. A botanical inventory was also performed. Our results indicated that microbial richness, composition and abundance were linked to the plant cover type and the dominant plant species. Furthermore, a large proportion of Ascomycota phylum (fungi), mostly in non-rainforest formations, and Planctomycetes phylum (bacteria) in all formations were observed. Interestingly, such patterns could be indicators of past disturbances that occurred on different time scales. Furthermore, the bacteria and fungi were influenced by diverse edaphic parameters as well as by the interplay between these two soil communities. Another striking finding was the existence of a site effect. Differences in microbial communities between geographical locations may be explained by dispersal limitation in the context of the biogeographical island theory. In conclusion, each plant formation at each site possesses is own microbial community resulting from multiple interactions between abiotic and biotic factors.

AB  - Ericoid mycorrhiza occur only within the plant family Ericaceae, yet are globally widespread and contribute to carbon and nutrient cycling in many habitats where harsh conditions limit decomposition and plant nutrient uptake. An increasingly diverse range of fungi are recognized as ericoid symbionts and patterns in the distribution of ericoid taxa are beginning to emerge across scales. However, the true diversity of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi remains unresolved due to limited sampling from some regions and challenges associated with delineating mycorrhizal taxa from the broader fungal community associated with ericoid plants. Interpreting patterns in the diversity and distributions of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi will ultimately require improved understanding of their functional ecology and functional diversity, which is currently limited to a few well studied species. Fortunately, many ericoid taxa are amenable to experimental manipulation and continued ericoid mycorrhizal research promises to improve general understanding of the ecology and evolution of mycorrhizal symbioses.

AB  - Although the eco-evolutionary dynamics of multicellular organisms are intertwined with the microorganisms that colonize them, there is only a rudimentary understanding of how a host's genotype influences its microbiome. We utilize Populus angustifolia to test whether communities of essential symbionts, ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), vary among host genotypes. Further, we test whether EMF communities covary among tree genotypes with the chemistry of senescent leaves and aboveground biomass, traits important to tree fitness, and carbon and nutrient cycling. We found: 1) EMF composition, colonization and the Basidiomycota to Ascomycota ratio varied among tree genotypes (broad-sense heritability = 0.10-0.25). 2) EMF composition did not covary among genotypes with aboveground biomass but it did covary with senescent leaf chemistry (rho = 0.29), primarily due to a single genotype. These findings demonstrate a link between tree genotype and EMF communities, which has implications for fungal diversity, host-symbiont interactions and aboveground-belowground linkages in ecological and evolutionary contexts.

AB  - Rising temperatures enhance microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) and thereby increase the soil CO2 efflux. Elevated decomposition rates might differently affect distinct SOM pools, depending on their stability and accessibility. Soil fractions derived from density fractionation have been suggested to represent SOM pools with different turnover times and stability against microbial decomposition. To investigate the effect of soil warming on functionally different soil organic matter pools, we here investigated the chemical and isotopic composition of bulk soil and three density fractions (free particulate organic matter, fPOM; occluded particulate organic matter, oPOM; and mineral associated organic matter, MaOM) of a C-rich soil from a long-term warming experiment in a spruce forest in the Austrian Alps. At the time of sampling, the soil in this experiment had been warmed during the snow free period for seven consecutive years. During that time no thermal adaptation of the microbial community could be identified and CO2 release from the soil continued to be elevated by the warming treatment. Our results, which included organic carbon content, total nitrogen content, delta C-13, Delta C-14, delta N-15 and the chemical composition, identified by pyrolysis-GC/MS, showed no significant differences in bulk soil between warming treatment and control. Surprisingly, the differences in the three density fractions were mostly small and the direction of warming induced change was variable with fraction and soil depth. Warming led to reduced N content in topsoil oPOM and subsoil fPOM and to reduced relative abundance of N-bearing compounds in subsoil MaUM. Further, warming increased the delta C-13 of MaOM at both sampling depths, reduced the relative abundance of carbohydrates while it increased the relative abundance of lignins in subsoil oPOM. As the size of the functionally different SOM pools did not significantly change, we assume that the few and small modifications in SOM chemistry result from an interplay of enhanced microbial decomposition of SOM and increased root litter input in the warmed plots. Overall, stable functional SOM pool sizes indicate that soil warming had similarly affected easily decomposable and stabilized SOM of this C-rich forest soil. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Due to land use history, most of the current temperate and boreal forests are developed on nutrient-poor and rocky soils, keeping fertile soils for agriculture. Consequently, the conditions occurring in forest ecosystems strongly differ from those of other terrestrial environments, giving importance to the access of nutritive elements and their recycling for the long-lasting development of forest ecosystems. In this review, we present an overview of the recent findings on the relationships between bacterial and fungal communities and their tree hosts at both the taxonomic and functional levels. We highlighted the common and different deterministic drivers of these microbial communities, focusing on the tree species effect, the different interfaces existing between the trees and their environment, the impact of tree byproducts (decaying wood and litter), the impact of soil and seasonal changes, and lastly, the consequences of forestry practices. Depicting both taxonomic and functional diversity based on cultivation dependent and -independent analyses, we highlight the distribution patterns and the functional traits characterizing bacterial and fungal communities. We also discuss the importance of bridging environmental microbiology to genomics and how to integrate the interactions between microorganisms for a better understanding of tree growth and health.

AB  - Myxomycetes are heterotrophic eukaryote organisms that have three life stages, none of which are known to be resistant to fire. The response of myxobiota to different severity of fire is not well known either. We examined myxomycetes in Pinus mugo plantations following a crown fire and in Pinus sylvestris plantations following a surface fire during the first three years after the wildfire event in forested coastal sand dunes in western Lithuania. Additionally, we investigated myxomycetes in corresponding unburned stands. All studied sites (unburned and burned) bore rather different myxomycete assemblages but the disparities of the species compositions between both burn types were more pronounced showing that fire severity had stronger impact on myxomycete species composition than the pre-fire stand type. Analysis of myxomycete assemblages (including the results from field collections, bark and litter cultures) showed that surface fire sites bore the highest number of post-fire species compared to crown fire and unburned sites. Dynamic annual changes in species composition were observed in all studied sites but only crown fire plots showed a clear chronosequence of post-fire myxomycete assemblages. Fire impact promoted establishment and/or sporulation of myxomycete species that are rare in similar unburned stands, or are usually confined to other types of forests and substrata. In addition, individual myxomycete species tended to switch substratum usage during the course of vegetation succession, with a final return to their usual substrata. This possibly signaled the end of early stage of post-fire succession. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hydraulic redistribution (HR) of water from wet to dry soil compartments by non-differentiated mycelium was recently shown for the saprotrophic fungus Agaricus bisporus. The redistributed water triggered the carbon (C) mineralization in the dry soil. The potential of other saprotrophic fungal species and their mycelia networks for HR in soils is unknown. Here, we tested the potential for HR of the mycelial cord forming species Schizophyllum commune, compared it to capillary water transport in a sandy soil and assessed the impact of HR on C mineralization and enzyme activities in mesocosm experiments with dry and wet soil compartments using labeled water (H-2) and labeled organic substrate (C-13, N-15). Further, we determined nitrogen (N) translocation between the soil compartments by the mycelium of S. commune and A. bisporus. The flow velocity of redistributed water in single hyphae of S. commune was about 0.43 cm min(-1) which is 1.5-2 times higher than in hyphae of A. bisporus, suggesting that cords enhance fungal HR. The amount of redistributed water was similar to capillary transport in the sterile sandy soil. Despite greater potential for HR, S. commune only slightly increased C mineralization and enzyme activity in the dry soil within 7 days. S. commune translocated N towards the organic substrate in the dry soil and used it for hyphal growth whereas A. bisporus redistributed N within the mycelial network towards the wet soil. Our results suggest that fungal hyphae have the potential to overcome capillary barriers between dry and wet soil compartments via HR and that the impact of fungal HR on C mineralization and N translocation is related to the foraging strategy and the resource usage of the fungus species.

AB  - Background and Aims Soil fertility and topographic microclimate are common determinants of plant species distributions. However, biotic conditions also vary along these abiotic gradients, and may mediate their effects on plants. In this study, we investigated whether soils and topographic microclimate acted directly on the performance of a focal understorey plant, or indirectly via changing biotic conditions. Methods We examined direct and indirect relationships between abiotic variables (soil fertility and topographic microclimate) and biotic factors (overstorey and understorey cover, litter depth and mycorrhizal colonization) and the occurrence, density and flowering of a common understorey herb, Trientalis latifolia, in the Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon, USA. Results We found that the positive effects of soil fertility on Trientalis occurrence were mediated by greater overstorey shading and deeper litter. However, we did not find any effects of topographic microclimate on Trientalis distribution that were mediated by the biotic variables we measured. The predictive success of Trientalis species distribution models with soils and topographic microclimate increased by 12 \% with the addition of the biotic variables. Conclusions Our results reinforce the idea that species distributions are the outcome of interrelated abiotic gradients and biotic interactions, and suggest that biotic conditions, such as overstorey density, should be included in species distribution models if data are available.

AB  - Tissue nitrogen (N) concentration has been correlated with respiration (RS) across plants of different life-forms, functional and phylogenetic groups, plant organs and ectomycorrhizae of different fungal species. Nothing is known, however, if a similar relationship exists in other organisms like fungi. Here, we explored the N-RS relationship across sporocarps of 93 fungal species that varied in their guilds (mutualistic, saprotrophic and parasitic) as well as tissue' types (caps and stipes). We hypothesized that RS, N and protein concentrations were higher for saprotrophic fungi than for either mutualistic or parasitic fungi and were higher for caps than for stipes. We also hypothesized that respiration of fungal guild could be predicted by the N concentration. Lastly, we predicted N and RS were phylogenetically conserved and that by subtracting metabolically inactive N in chitin, we could improve the N-RS relationship. Sporocarp N concentration only explained 26\% of the variation in RS across species. We found a significant difference in the N-RS relationship among the three fungal guilds, but no difference between the two tissue types. Saprotrophic species had higher N concentration and respiration than mutualistic and parasitic fungal species. Sporocarp components differed with caps showing both higher respiration and higher N and protein concentrations than stipes. Overall, our results show that fungal sporocarp nitrogen concentration is phylogenetically conserved among fungal families and may prove to be a strong predictor of fungal guild. The positive N-RS relationships existed for all fungal species (similar to plants), within fungal guilds (similar to plant functional groups), and fungal tissue' types (like plants' organs). The clear linkage of fungal sporocarp respiration to total N concentration could help improve C and N cycling models in forest ecosystems by including estimates of fungal respiration based on fungal N concentration.

AB  - Ecosystems dominated by plants in symbiosis with ectomycorrhizal fungi store more carbon in soils. There is increasing evidence that this may be due to competition between primary producers and microbial decomposers for soil nitrogen, mediated by ectomycorrhizal fungi. This competitive interaction inhibits decomposition and increases soil carbon storage. However, other work suggests elevated carbon storage is due to recalcitrant plant tissue chemistry in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems, rather than ectomycorrhizal competition for soil nitrogen. These two frameworks make similar predictions for soil carbon storage, making them difficult to distinguish empirically. Here I argue that the ectomycorrhizal-recalcitrance hypothesis is not well supported by recent developments in the understanding of soil carbon chemistry, or evolutionary relationships among ectomycorrhizal plants. Therefore, differences in input chemistry are not sufficient to discount alternative mechanisms of carbon stabilization in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems. Future work on EM-specific stabilization of soil C should focus on alternative mechanisms including competition for N, direct antagonistic interactions, and other microbial community driven mechanisms.

AB  - An increasing number of empirical studies are challenging the central fundamentals on which the classical soil food web model is built. This model assumes that bacteria consume labile substrates twice as fast as fungi, and that mycorrhizal fungi do not decompose organic matter. Here, we build on emerging evidence that points to significant consumption of labile C by fungi, and to the ability of ectomycorrhizal fungi to decompose organic matter, to show that labile C constitutes a major and presently underrated source of C for the soil food web. We use a simple model describing the dynamics of a recalcitrant and a labile C pool and their consumption by fungi and bacteria to show that fungal and bacterial populations can coexist in a stable state with large inputs into the labile C pool and a high fungal use of labile C. We propose a new conceptual model for the bottom trophic level of the soil food web, with organic C consisting of a continuous pool rather than two or three distinct pools, and saprotrophic fungi using substantial amounts of labile C. Incorporation of these concepts will increase our understanding of soil food web dynamics and functioning under changing conditions. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Studies focusing on the migration of radionuclides in the forest floor have demonstrated that the ecological half-life of radiocesium on organic layer containing the debris of plant litter with various fungi and microorganisms is shorter than that in the deeper soil zone, suggesting that the litter decomposition affects radiocesium mobilization. Here, we showed the involvement of lignin, one of the major cell wall components of plant litter, in the fate of contaminated radiocesium during the process of fungal litter decomposition. In this study, litter decomposition of two different woody species, broadleaf deciduous Japanese cherry consisted of hardwood lignin and coniferous evergreen Japanese cedar with softwood lignin, were accelerated by in vitro fungal inoculation. In vitro inoculation exhibited 1.93- to 2.59-times faster decomposition than field experiment. Then, the cherry litter lost approximately 25\% of initially contaminated radiocesium within 1 month of in vitro decomposition, whereas the cedar litter kept initial level at least for 6 month. The retention of radiocesium correlated with thioglycolate lignin content in cedar litter but not in cherry litter. Consequently, the behavior of radiocesium contaminated in litter fall may vary depending on the contamination pathway or the manner of nutrient mobilization at the stage of abscission between evergreen and deciduous trees.

AB  - Collembola are among the most abundant, diverse and functionally important groups of soil animals. Collembolans inhabit different litter and soil layers and their food objects are intimately related to their habitat. Morphological differences that separate high rank taxa of collembolans have clear functional meaning in relation to life style and habitat requirements (including position in the soil profile). However, no study has tested the hypothesis that the species within the major functional groups also differ in terms of trophic positions. This hypothesis was tested for the first time using stable isotope analysis. We compiled original and published data on the stable isotope composition of 82 collembolan species in temperate forest ecosystems. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of collembolans were found related to their life forms, reflecting a shift in available food objects across different habitat layers and matching the vertical isotopic gradient of soil organic matter. The trophic niche of species varied among different collembolan orders and families, indicating a pronounced phylogenetic signal and supporting the trophic niche conservatism hypothesis. Considering stable isotope compositions, as well as the taxonomic identity and life form of species, we outlined four collembolan functional guilds that use different types of food and perform different ecosystem functions.

AB  - Our understanding of the long-lasting effects of human land use on soil fungal communities in tropical forests is limited. Yet, over 70\% of all remaining tropical forests are growing in former agricultural or logged areas. We investigated the relationship among land use history, biotic and abiotic factors, and soil fungal community composition and diversity in a second-growth tropical forest in Puerto Rico. We coupled high-throughput DNA sequencing with tree community and environmental data to determine whether land use history had an effect on soil fungal community descriptors. We also investigated the biotic and abiotic factors that underlie such differences and asked whether the relative importance of biotic (tree diversity, basal tree area, and litterfall biomass) and abiotic (soil type, pH, iron, and total carbon, water flow, and canopy openness) factors in structuring soil fungal communities differed according to land use history. We demonstrated long-lasting effects of land use history on soil fungal communities. At our research site, most of the explained variation in soil fungal composition (R-2 = 18.6\%), richness (R-2 = 11.4\%), and evenness (R-2 = 10\%) was associated with edaphic factors. Areas previously subject to both logging and farming had a soil fungal community with lower beta diversity and greater evenness of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) than areas subject to light logging. Yet, fungal richness was similar between the two areas of historical land use. Together, these results suggest that fungal communities in disturbed areas are more homogeneous and diverse than in areas subject to light logging. Edaphic factors were the most strongly correlated with soil fungal composition, especially in areas subject to light logging, where soils are more heterogenous. High functional tree diversity in areas subject to both logging and farming led to stronger correlations between biotic factors and fungal composition than in areas subject to light logging. In contrast, fungal richness and evenness were more strongly correlated with biotic factors in areas of light logging, suggesting that these metrics might reflect long-term associations in old-growth forests. The large amount of unexplained variance in fungal composition suggests that these communities are structured by both stochastic and niche assemblage processes.

AB  - How forests cope with drought-induced perturbations and how the dependence of soil respiration on environmental and biological drivers is affected in a warming and drying context are becoming key questions. The aims of this study were to determine whether drought-induced die-off and forest succession were reflected in soil respiration and its components and to determine the influence of climate on the soil respiration components. We used the mesh exclusion method to study seasonal variations in soil respiration (R-S) and its components: heterotrophic (R-H) and autotrophic (R-A) {[}further split into fine root (R-R) and mycorrhizal respiration (R-M)] in a mixed Mediterranean forest where Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is undergoing a drought-induced die-off and is being replaced by holm oak (Quercus ilex L.). Drought-induced pine die-off was not reflected in R-S nor in its components, which denotes a high functional resilience of the plant and soil system to pine die-off. However, the succession from Scots pine to holm oak resulted in a reduction of R-H and thus in an important decrease of total respiration (R-S was 36 \% lower in holm oaks than in non-defoliated pines). Furthermore, R-S and all its components were strongly regulated by soil water content-and-temperature interaction. Since Scots pine die-off and Quercus species colonization seems to be widely occurring at the driest limit of the Scots pine distribution, the functional resilience of the soil system over die-off and the decrease of R-S from Scots pine to holm oak could have direct consequences for the C balance of these ecosystems.

AB  - Inaccurate estimate of the largest terrestrial carbon pool, soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, is the major source of uncertainty in simulating feedback of climate warming on ecosystem-atmosphere carbon dioxide exchange by process-based ecosystem and soil carbon models. Although the models need to simplify complex environmental processes of soil carbon sequestration, in a large mosaic of environments a missing key driver could lead to a modeling bias in predictions of SOC stock change. We aimed to evaluate SOC stock estimates of process-based models (Yasso07, Q, and CENTURY soil sub-model v4) against a massive Swedish forest soil inventory data set (3230 samples) organized by a recursive partitioning method into distinct soil groups with underlying SOC stock development linked to physicochemical conditions. For two-thirds of measurements all models predicted accurate SOC stock levels regardless of the detail of input data, e.g., whether they ignored or included soil properties. However, in fertile sites with high N deposition, high cation exchange capacity, or moderately increased soil water content, Yasso07 and Q models underestimated SOC stocks. In comparison to Yasso07 and Q, accounting for the site-specific soil characteristics (e. g. clay content and topsoil mineral N) by CENTURY improved SOC stock estimates for sites with high clay content, but not for sites with high N deposition. Our analysis suggested that the soils with poorly predicted SOC stocks, as characterized by the high nutrient status and well-sorted parent material, indeed have had other predominant drivers of SOC stabilization lacking in the models, presumably the mycorrhizal organic uptake and organo-mineral stabilization processes. Our results imply that the role of soil nutrient status as regulator of organic matter mineralization has to be re-evaluated, since correct SOC stocks are decisive for predicting future SOC change and soil CO2 efflux.

AB  - Extramatrical mycelia (EMM) of ectomycorrhizal fungi are important in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in forests, but poor knowledge about EMM biomass and necromass turnovers makes the quantification of their role problematic. We studied the impacts of elevated CO2 and N fertilization on EMM production and turnover in a Pinus taeda forest. EMM C was determined by the analysis of ergosterol (biomass), chitin (total bio- and necromass) and total organic C (TOC) of sand-filled mycelium in-growth bags. The production and turnover of EMM bio- and necromass and total C were estimated by modelling. N fertilization reduced the standing EMM biomass C to 57\% and its production to 51\% of the control (from 238 to 122kgCha(-1)yr(-1)), whereas elevated CO2 had no detectable effects. Biomass turnover was high (13yr(-1)) and unchanged by the treatments. Necromass turnover was slow and was reduced from 1.5yr(-1) in the control to 0.65yr(-1) in the N-fertilized treatment. However, TOC data did not support an N effect on necromass turnover. An estimated EMM production ranging from 2.5 to 6\% of net primary production stresses the importance of its inclusion in C models. A slow EMM necromass turnover indicates an importance in building up forest humus.

AB  - Previously extensive tracts of primary rain forest have been degraded by human activities, and we examined how the effects of forest disturbance arising from habitat fragmentation and commercial selective logging affected ecosystem functioning in these habitats by studying leaf litter decomposition rates in litter bags placed on the forest floor. The rain forests of Borneo are dominated by trees from the family Dipterocarpaceae, and we compared leaf litter decomposition rates of three dipterocarp species at eight forest fragment sites (area 3-3529 ha) that had different histories of disturbance pre-fragmentation: four fragments had been selectively logged prior to fragmentation and four had been formed from previously undisturbed forest. We compared these logged and unlogged forest fragments with sites in continuous forest that had been selectively logged (two sites) and fully protected and undisturbed (two sites). After 120 d, undisturbed continuous forest sites had the fastest rates of decomposition (52\% mass loss). Forest fragments formed from unlogged forest (32\% mass loss) had faster decomposition rates than logged forest fragments (28\% mass loss), but slower rates than continuous logged forest (39\% mass loss). Leaves of a light-demanding species (Parashorea malaanonan) decomposed faster than those of a shade-tolerant species (Hopea nervosa), but decomposition of all three dipterocarp species that we studied responded similarly to logging and fragmentation effects. Reduced decomposition rates in logged and fragmented forest sites may affect nutrient cycling and thus have detrimental consequences for forest regeneration. Conservation management to improve forest quality should be a priority, particularly in logged forest fragments.

AB  - Understanding the vertical distribution patterns of soil microbial community and its driving factors in alpine grasslands in the humid regions of the Tibet Plateau might be of great significance for predicting the soil microbial community of this type of vegetation in response to environmental change. Using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA), we investigated soil microbial community composition along an elevational gradient (3094 similar to 4131 m above sea level) on Mount Yajiageng, and we explored the impact of plant functional groups and soil chemistry on the soil microbial community. Except for Arbuscular Mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungi) biomarker 18:2 omega 6,9 increasing significantly, other biomarkers did not show a consistent trend with the elevational gradient. Microbial biomass quantified by total PLFAs did not show the elevational trend and had mean values ranging from 1.64 to 4.09 mu mol per g organic carbon (OC), which had the maximum value at the highest site. Bacterial PLFAs exhibited a similar trend with total PLFAs, and its mean values ranged from 0.82 to 1.81 mu mol (g OC)(-1). The bacterial to fungal biomass ratios had the minimum value at the highest site, which might be related to temperature and soil total nitrogen (TN). The ratios of Gram-negative to Gram-positive bacteria had a significantly negative correlation with soil TN and had the maximum value at the highest site. Leguminous plant coverage and soil TN explained 58\% of the total variation in the soil microbial community and could achieve the same interpretation as the whole model. Other factors may influence the soil microbial community through interaction with leguminous plant coverage and soil TN. Soil chemistry and plant functional group composition in substantial amounts explained different parts of the variation within the soil microbial community, and the interaction between them had no impact on the soil microbial community maybe because long-term grazing greatly reduces litter. In sum, although there were obvious differences in soil microbial communities along the elevation gradient, there were no clear elevational trends found in general. Plant functional groups and soil chemistry respectively affect the different aspects of soil microbial community. Leguminous plant coverage and soil TN had important effects in shaping soil microbial community.

AB  - Soil microbial communities are essential for ecosystem function, but linking community composition to biogeochemical processes is challenging because of high microbial diversity and large spatial variability of most soil characteristics. We investigated soil bacterial community structure in a switchgrass stand planted on soil with a history of grassland vegetation at high spatial resolution to determine whether biogeographic trends occurred at the centimeter scale. Moreover, we tested whether such heterogeneity, if present, influenced community structure within or among ecosystems. Pronounced heterogeneity was observed at centimeter scales, with abrupt changes in relative abundance of phyla from sample to sample. At the ecosystem scale (> 10 m), however, bacterial community composition and structure were subtly, but significantly, altered by fertilization, with higher alpha diversity in fertilized plots. Moreover, by comparing these data with data from 1772 soils from the Earth Microbiome Project, it was found that 20\% diverse globally sourced soil samples, while grassland soils shared approximately 40\% of their operational taxonomic units with the current study. By spanning several orders of magnitude, the analysis suggested that extreme patchiness characterized community structure at smaller scales but that coherent patterns emerged at larger length scales.

AB  - Due to high abundance and feeding habits, invertebrates are of great importance for shaping microbial communities at the fine scale. Springtails (Collembola) that feed on fungal spores and mycelia may contribute to dispersal through carrying fungal propagules in their guts or on their appendages. The Collembola-fungal associations are mainly investigated by microscopy or culturing techniques, which allow identify only fungi that have distinctive morphological characteristics or that can be cultured in vitro. Here we identified the Collembola-associated fungi on the body surface and in the gut content using both culturing and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods. We studied three epigeic Collembola species found on the Norway spruce dominated forest stands throughout the vegetation period - Entomobrya nivalis, Orchesella flavescens and Pogonognathellus longicornis. We discovered over 1200 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs), i.e. the proxies for species, based on 97\% sequence similarity of the ITS2 subregion of ribosomal DNA. Most of the fungi were saprotrophs, but we detected also mycorrhizal, parasitic and lichenized fungi. Season was the most important factor affecting fungal richness and composition, especially on body surface. Although the data matrix revealed significant effect of substrate, we were unable to detect the significant fungal community differences between body surface and gut samples of conspecifics. There were no significant differences among studied epigeic Collembola species in the preference for fungal diet. Our study demonstrates that collembolans associate with a broader range of fungi than previously observed and thus potentially play an important role in enhancing fungal colonization through dispersal activities.

AB  - Boreal peatlands play a crucial role in global carbon cycling, acting as an important carbon reservoir. However, little information is available on how peatland microbial communities are influenced by natural variability or human-induced disturbances. In this study, we have investigated the fungal diversity and community structure of both the organic soil layer and buried wood in boreal forest soils using high-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. We have also compared the fungal communities during the primary colonization of wood with those of the surrounding soils. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) confirmed that the community composition significantly differed between soil types (P< 0.001) and tree species (P< 0.001). The distance-based linear models analysis showed that environmental variables were significantly correlated with community structure (P< 0.04). The availability of soil nutrients (Ca {[}P = 0.002], Fe {[}P = 0.003], and P {[}P = 0.003]) within the site was an important factor in the fungal community composition. The species richness in wood was significantly lower than in the corresponding soil (P< 0.004). The results of the molecular identification were supplemented by fruiting body surveys. Seven of the genera of Agaricomycotina identified in our surveys were among the top 20 genera observed in pyrosequencing data. Our study is the first, to our knowledge, fungal high-throughput next-generation sequencing study performed on peatlands; it further provides a baseline for the investigation of the dynamics of the fungal community in the boreal peatlands.

AB  - 1. Long-term soil chronosequences provide natural soil fertility gradients that can be used to explore linkages between soils and plant community composition and diversity. Well-studied forested soil chronosequences have revealed that local (a) plant diversity increases with greater soil age and declining fertility, but corresponding changes in species turnover and beta (b) diversity have not been explored, particularly in extremely species-rich regions. 2. We quantified changes in plant species diversity and community composition, and identified the edaphic drivers of these changes, along a >2-million year retrogressive dune chronosequence in the south-west Australia biodiversity hotspot. 3. We found greater plant species diversity across all growth forms as soil development proceeded and concentrations of soil nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P), diminished to extremely low levels (surface soil total P concentrations of 6 mg P kg(-1)). Despite the high plant a diversity on older nutrient-impoverished soils, species turnover across the chronosequence was exceptionally high when all growth forms were considered (mean of 1\% of species shared between the youngest and oldest soils), and there was complete turnover of woody species along the chronosequence. Such extreme species turnover across the chronosequence reflected large changes in soil chemical properties. In addition, b diversity within individual chronosequence stages increased with declining soil fertility. Shrubs remained the dominant and most speciose growth form throughout the chronosequence. 4. Synthesis. The large increase in plant a diversity and the extreme species turnover associated with declining soil fertility highlight the central role of soil properties in driving plant community assembly during long-term ecosystem development, previously only reported from comparatively species-poor regions. Our finding that plant b diversity increased with declining soil fertility points to a novel mechanism whereby extremely low soil fertility, rather than high productivity, promotes high b diversity. These results suggest that the interaction of an exceptionally diverse plant species pool and nutrient-impoverished soils provides the basis for the maintenance of such high b diversity at extremely low soil fertility.

AB  - Phyllosphere fungi show high species diversity and fulfill important ecological functions not only in natural forests but also in plantations. We sought to estimate the species diversity and community structure of phyllosphere fungi from tropical tree plantation plots in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. We conducted a massively parallel amplicon sequencing analysis of fungi collected from the leaves of Shorea leprosula (Dipterocarpaceae), an ecologically and commercially important tree species. Phyllosphere fungal compositions and spatial variability were investigated for 31 S. leprosula trees across four plots within a plantation stand. In total, 488 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were recognized in 153,194 ribosomal internal transcribed spacer reads at 95\% OTU identity level. Rare OTUs accounted for the majority of fungal diversity detected in the study site; 200 OTUs (41\%) comprised fewer than 10 reads and 465 OTUs (95\%) were found in fewer than half of the samples. Fungal OTU compositions of S. leprosula trees were differentiated within a narrow area of the plantation and even between plots that were separated by 15 m. These findings indicate that highly diverse fungal OTUs form spatially structured communities even within a tropical plantation stand of single tree species.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi produce low molecular weight organic compounds, supporting diverse microbial communities. To link mycorrhizal root exudation directly to bacterial responses, we used Scots pine exudates with (Suillus variegatus and Piloderma fallax) and without mycorrhiza as substrata for forest soil bacteria. Bacterial growth and vitality was monitored, and community composition determined using TRFLP, cloning and sequencing. We investigated if the amount of organic acids in exudates explained bacterial growth, and whether bacterial communities were influenced by pre-exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2. We demonstrated functional differences in bacterial growth rates related to CO2. There was a shift in the bacterial community (e.g. Burkholderia sp. and gamma-proteobacteria) toward organisms better able to rapidly utilize exudates when pine microcosms were pre-exposed to elevated CO2. Soil bacteria from all treatments tended to grow more abundantly and rapidly in exudates from Pilo derma -colonized seedlings, suggesting that the organic acids and/or unidentified compounds present supported greater growth.

AB  - Few studies have investigated how soil fungal communities respond to elevation, especially within TMCF (tropical montane cloud forests). We used an elevation gradient in a TMCF in Costa Rica to determine how soil properties, processes, and community composition of fungi change in response to elevation and across seasons. As elevation increased, soil temperature and soil pH decreased, while soil moisture and soil C:N ratios increased with elevation. Responses of these properties varied seasonally. Fungal abundance increased with elevation during wet and dry seasons. Fungal community composition shifted in response to elevation, and to a lesser extent by season. These shifts were accompanied by varying responses of important fungal functional groups during the wet season and the relative abundance of certain fungal phyla. We suggest that elevation and the responses of certain fungal functional groups may be structuring fungal communities along this elevation gradient. TMCF are ecosystems that are rapidly changing due to climate change. Our study suggests that these changes may affect how fungal communities are structured.

AB  - Changes in soil nutrient availability during long-term ecosystem development influence the relative abundances of plant species with different nutrient-acquisition strategies. These changes in strategies are observed at the community level, but whether they also occur within individual species remains unknown. Plant species forming multiple root symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, and nitrogen-(N) fixing microorganisms provide valuable model systems to examine edaphic controls on symbioses related to nutrient acquisition, while simultaneously controlling for plant host identity. We grew two co-occurring species, Acacia rostellifera (N-2-fixing and dual AM and ECM symbioses) and Melaleuca systena (AM and ECM dual symbioses), in three soils of contrasting ages (c. 0.1, 1, and 120 ka) collected along a long-term dune chronosequence in southwestern Australia. The soils differ in the type and strength of nutrient limitation, with primary productivity being limited by N (0.1 ka), co-limited by N and phosphorus (P) (1 ka), and by P (120 ka). We hypothesized that (i) within-species root colonization shifts from AM to ECM with increasing soil age, and that (ii) nodulation declines with increasing soil age, reflecting the shift from N to P limitation along the chronosequence. In both species, we observed a shift from AM to ECM root colonization with increasing soil age. In addition, nodulation in A. rostellifera declined with increasing soil age, consistent with a shift from N to P limitation. Shifts from AM to ECM root colonization reflect strengthening P limitation and an increasing proportion of total soil P in organic forms in older soils. This might occur because ECM fungi can access organic P via extracellular phosphatases, while AM fungi do not use organic P. Our results show that plants can shift their resource allocation to different root symbionts depending on nutrient availability during ecosystem development.

AB  - Root growth into the litter layer occurs in many forest ecosystems, but its effect on litter decomposition is not well understood. An experiment with two factors and two levels (the litters of Pinus elliottii needles with higher carbon/nitrogen (C/N) and carbon/phosphorous (C/P) ratios vs. Liquidambar formosana leaves with lower C/N and C/P ratios, with and without Loropetalum chinense roots grown into the litters) was conducted in situ using the nylon net bag method in a subtropical forest. Organic C (OC), N, and P concentrations in decomposing litters, as well as litter and root masses, were measured at 3, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. Our results showed that the presence of roots generally increased the rates of mass loss, and OC, N, and P releases, and decreased the OC and N concentrations, but did not alter the P concentration and the C/N, C/P, and N/P ratios in the decomposing litters of both woody species. The influencing intensity of root presence was stronger on the decomposition of L. formosana than P. elliottii litters. Root proliferation percentage in decomposing litters was generally lower in P. elliottii than in L. formosana litters from months 1-12, but showed opposite trend in months 12-24. In conclusion, the interaction between root growth and litter decomposition might depend on litter quality, and it might vary with the stage of decomposition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understory plant communities play critical ecological roles in forest ecosystems. Both above- and below-ground ecosystem properties and processes influence these communities but relatively little is known about such effects at fine (i.e., one to several meters within-stand) scales, particularly for forests in which the canopy is dominated by a single species. An improved understanding of these effects is critical for understanding how understory biodiversity is regulated in such forests and for anticipating impacts of changing disturbance regimes. Our primary objective was to examine the patterns of fine-scale variation in understory plant communities and their relationships to above-and below-ground resource and environmental heterogeneity within mature lodgepole pine forests. We assessed composition and diversity of understory vegetation in relation to heterogeneity of both the above ground (canopy tree density, canopy and tall shrub basal area and cover, downed wood biomass, litter cover) and below-ground (soil nutrient availability, decomposition, forest floor thickness, pH, and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and multiple carbon-source substrate-induced respiration (MSIR) of the forest floor microbial community) environment. There was notable variation in fine-scale plant community composition; cluster and indicator species analyses of the 24 most commonly occurring understory species distinguished four assemblages, one for which a pioneer forb species had the highest cover levels, and three others that were characterized by different bryophyte species having the highest cover. Constrained ordination (distance-based redundancy analysis) showed that two above-ground (mean tree diameter, litter cover) and eight below-ground (forest floor pH, plant available boron, microbial community composition and function as indicated by MSIR and PLFAs) properties were associated with variation in understory plant community composition. These results provide novel insights into the important ecological associations between understory plant community composition and heterogeneity in ecosystem properties and processes within forests dominated by a single canopy species.

AB  - A chaparral and pine biosequence established in 1946 was burned in a wildfire in 2002. Thorough studies of the soil environments during the previous two decades established a baseline for comparison of post-fire changes. Aboveground vegetation was reduced to charred stems, and litter layers were combusted to white ash and charred material. Nevertheless, during the first year after the fire, runoff and erosion were minimal because biotically produced macropores maintained high infiltration rates. Loss of cover and plant transpiration made the soil warmer and moister. Combustion of organic matter mineralized constituent cations, increasing base cation concentrations in soil solutions and solid phases within the first few months after the fire. The pH, C, and N also increased in the soil, and the biological environment was extensively altered. Surface-active macrofauna increased, though seasonal patterns of abundance were unchanged. Post-fire fungal communities were distinctly different from pre-fire communities and were more similar to each other than were pre-fire communities. Overall, many of the wildfire impacts appear to be of short duration. Within 6 mo, original species were resprouting or emerging as seedlings, and most soil chemical, physical, and biological properties were either similar to pre-fire conditions or were rapidly returning toward them.

AB  - In temperate and boreal forest ecosystems, nitrogen (N) limitation of tree metabolism is alleviated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. As forest soils age, the primary source of N in soil switches from inorganic (NH4 (+) and NO3 (-)) to organic (mostly proteins). It has been hypothesized that ECM fungi adapt to the most common N source in their environment, which implies that fungi growing in older forests would have greater protein degradation abilities. Moreover, recent results for a model ECM fungal species suggest that organic N uptake requires a glucose supply. To test the generality of these hypotheses, we screened 55 strains of 13 Suillus species with different ecological preferences for their in vitro protein degradation abilities. Suillus species preferentially occurring in mature forests, where soil contains more organic matter, had significantly higher protease activity than those from young forests with low-organic-matter soils or species indifferent to forest age. Within species, the protease activities of ecotypes from soils with high or low soil organic N content did not differ significantly, suggesting resource partitioning between mineral and organic soil layers. The secreted protease mixtures were strongly dominated by aspartic peptidases. Glucose addition had variable effects on secreted protease activity; in some species, it triggered activity, but in others, activity was repressed at high concentrations. Collectively, our results indicate that protease activity, a key ectomycorrhizal functional trait, is positively related to environmental N source availability but is also influenced by additional factors, such as carbon availability.

AB  - Wildfire activity is projected to increase in boreal forests as a result of climate warming. The consequences of increased wildfire activity for soil carbon (C) storage in boreal forests may depend on the sensitivity of soil microbes to fire severity, but microbial responses to boreal forest fire severity are not well known. Here, we combine remote sensing of fire severity and field sampling to characterize the response of soil microbial biomass per g soil, microbial respiration of CO2 per g soil, and fungal groups to fire severity in a boreal forest ecosystem. We used remote sensing measurements of differenced normalized burn ratio from Landsat as a measure of fire severity. Our results demonstrate that fire severity controls soil microbial responses to boreal forest fires. In comparison to unburned stands, burned stands had a 52\% and 56\% reduction in soil microbial biomass and basal respiration, respectively. Within burned stands, we found that microbial biomass and basal respiration significantly declined with increasing fire severity. In addition, mycorrhizal taxa and basidiomycetes displayed particularly low tolerances for severe fire. Although wildfires result in the immediate loss of soil C, our study provides evidence that decreases in microbial biomass and respiration following high severity fires may reduce the capacity of the soil microbial community to decompose soil C over longer time scales. Therefore, models of C cycle responses to climate warming may need to represent the sensitivity of microbial biomass and fungal community composition to fire severity in boreal forests.

AB  - Plants typically expend a significant portion of their available carbon (C) on nutrient acquisition - C that could otherwise support growth. However, given that most global terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) do not include the C cost of nutrient acquisition, these models fail to represent current and future constraints to the land C sink. Here, we integrated a plant productivity-optimized nutrient acquisition model - the Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen Model - into one of the most widely used TBMs, the Community Land Model. Global plant nitrogen (N) uptake is dynamically simulated in the coupled model based on the C costs of N acquisition from mycorrhizal roots, nonmycorrhizal roots,N-fixing microbes, and retranslocation (from senescing leaves). We find that at the global scale, plants spend 2.4Pg C yr(-1) to acquire 1.0 Pg Nyr(-1), and that the C cost of N acquisition leads to a downregulation of global net primary production (NPP) by 13\%. Mycorrhizal uptake represented the dominant pathway by which N is acquired, accounting for similar to 66\% of the N uptake by plants. Notably, roots associating with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi - generally considered for their role in phosphorus (P) acquisition - are estimated to be the primary source of global plant N uptake owing to the dominance of AM-associated plants in mid- and low-latitude biomes. Overall, our coupled model improves the representations of NPP downregulation globally and generates spatially explicit patterns of belowground C allocation, soil N uptake, and N retranslocation at the global scale. Such model improvements are critical for predicting how plant responses to altered N availability (owing to N deposition, rising atmospheric CO2, and warming temperatures) may impact the land C sink.

AB  - Vast forest areas in eastern Japan have been contaminated with radio-isotopes by the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident. Radiocesium (radioCs) is known to remain bioavailable in forest ecosystems for a long time, and it is necessary to terminate the cycling process to decontaminate the forest ecosystem. We observed radiocesium concentrations of leaf litter during decomposition on a forest floor where radiocesium (Cs-137) contamination was similar to 155 kBq/m(2). Litter bag experiments were conducted with newly fallen mixed deciduous leaf litter in a deciduous forest (alt. 610 m) about 50 km from the FDNPP. Litter bags were retrieved in April, June, August, October, and December 2012. Fresh litter Cs-137 concentration was similar to 3000 Bq/kg in December 2011. During the decomposition process on the forest floor, litter Cs-137 concentration increased rapidly and exceeded 25,000 Bq/kg after 6 months, whereas potassium (K) concentration in the litter was rather stable, indicating that radiocesium and K showed contrasting dynamics during the early decomposition phase. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and Cs-137 contents were positively correlated to fungal biomass, evaluated by phospholipid fatty acids in the litter during decomposition. The increase of radiocesium concentration mainly occurred during from April to October, when fungal growth peaked. Therefore, this suggests fungal translocation of nutrients from outside the litter substrate (immobilization) is the mechanism to increase radiocesium in the decomposing litter. The amount of Cs-137 contained in the 1-year-old decomposed leaf litter was estimated to be 4\% per area of the soil-contaminated Cs-137. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Resolving the effects of nitrogen (N) on decomposition is ecologically critical for predicting the ecosystem consequences of increased anthropogenic N deposition. Although root litter is the dominant soil carbon (C) and nutrient input in many forest ecosystems, studies have rarely examined how the process of root decomposition is affected by N availability. In a field experiment, we studied the effects of N addition on fine root (<0.5 mm diameter) decomposition using five substrates ranging in initial gravimetric lignin concentrations (from 10.8\% to 34.1\%) over five years, and made a simultaneous characterization of effects of N on the enzymatic activity of the decomposer community in three temperate forests. Across substrates, asymptotic decomposition models best described the decomposition. The effects of N addition shifted over the course of fine root decomposition, regardless of initial lignin concentrations, with N speeding up the initial rate of decomposition, but ultimately resulting in a larger, slowly decomposing litter fraction (A). Such contrasting effects of N addition on initial and later stages of decomposition were closely linked to the dynamics of its extracellular enzyme activity. Our results emphasized the need for studies of N effects on litter decomposition that encompass the later stages of decomposition. This study suggested that atmospheric N addition may have contrasting effects on the dynamics of different carbon pools in forest soils, and such contrasting effects of N should be widely considered in biogeochemical models.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi constitute a large proportion of the belowground microbial biomass and contribute significantly to nutrient cycling, but their role in soil food webs remains poorly known. In this study, we compared the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of collembolans and mycoheterotrophic plants. Stable isotope composition of collembolans was very similar to those of mycotrophic plants associated with saprotrophic fungi. In contrast, mycotrophic plants associated with mycorrhizal fungi were enriched in N-15 relative to collembolans by at least 5 parts per thousand. Our data suggest that soil collembolans do not use mycorrhizal fungi as the main food source, and support an emerging view that extramatrical mycorrhizal mycelium can be retained in the soil to serve as a progenitor of stabilized soil organic matter.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) availability is expected to affect soil microbial community. However, our knowledge about the responses of soil microbial biomass and community composition to P availability is still limited. In this study, we established field plots with addition of 0, 5 (LP), 15 (MP) and 30 (HP) g P m(-2) y(-1) in a subalpine spruce plantation and investigated the responses of soil microbes. Chloroform fumigation extraction and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis were used to determine soil microbial biomass and community composition, respectively. After two growing seasons of P addition, the HP treatment significantly increased soil microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen and P. The P addition exerted the specific influences on soil microbial community composition. The abundance of most groups of soil microbial community (bacteria, fungi, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) increased in the HP treatment and the ratio of fungi to bacteria decreased in the LP and MP treatment, whereas the nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination revealed no significant difference in the PLFA pattern between the P treatments and the control. Although soil P availability increased in all P treatments compared to the control, the dissolved organic carbon, indicative of soil carbon availability, was promoted only by the HP treatment. Besides, soil microbial biomass was positively correlated to soil carbon availability and pH. These results indicate that soil microbes are insensitive to the elevated P availability in this spruce plantation and P addition increases soil microbial biomass mainly through improving carbon availability and pH.

AB  - 1. Fine roots and mycorrhiza often represent the largest input of carbon (C) into soils and are therefore of primary relevance to the soil C balance. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have previously been found to increase litter decomposition which may lead to reduced soil C stocks, but these studies have focused on immediate decomposition of relatively high amounts of high-quality litter and may therefore not hold in many ecological settings over longer terms. 2. Here, we assessed the effect of mycorrhizal fungi on the fate of C and nitrogen (N) contained within a realistic amount of highly C-13-/N-15-labelled root litter in soil. This litter was either added fresh or after a 3-month incubation period under field conditions to a hyphal in-growth core where mycorrhizal abundance was either reduced or not through rotation. After 3 months of incubation with a plant under glasshouse conditions, the effect of turning cores on residual C-13 and N-15 inside the cores was measured, as well as C-13 incorporation in microbial signature fatty acids and N-15 incorporation of plants. 3. Turning of cores increased the abundance of fungal decomposers and C-13 loss from cores, while N-15 content of cores and plants was unaffected. Despite the difference in disturbance that turning the cores could have caused, the results suggest that mycorrhizal fungi and field incubation of litter acted to additively increase the proportion of C-13 left in cores. 4. Synthesis. Apart from stimulating litter decomposition as previously shown, mycorrhizas can also stabilize C during litter decomposition and this effect is persistent through time.

AB  - Fire, besides affecting plant litter fate in natural ecosystems, is a widely used tool to manage crop residues in agro-ecosystems. In both cases, burning of plant residues produces highly heterogeneous materials, ranging from little affected plant tissues, to charred substrates, up to mineral ashes, whose chemical nature and biological effects are not yet fully clarified. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of litter treated at different temperatures (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 degrees C) on saprotrophic fungi, plant pathogenic microbes, and higher plants. To this purpose, we combined a characterization of 48 organic materials by C-13-CPMAS NMR spectroscopy with a multi-species laboratory bioassay on seven target organisms (one plant and six microbes). Consistent with previous observations, we showed that, as charring temperature increased, litter quality significantly changed, with a progressive loss of O-alkyl C, di-O-alkyl C, and methoxyl and N-alkyl C, coupled with an enrichment in aromatic C, irrespective of plant litter types. Noteworthy, the bioassay showed that untreated litter had a major inhibitory effect on the test plant, while it acted as a suitable substrate sustaining microbial growth. On the contrary, as litter was charred its biochemical quality decreased with increasing temperature because of a progressive disappearance of easily degradable C sources and enrichment of recalcitrant aromatic fractions. Therefore, charred litter became an organic material suitable to sustain plant growth, but was largely inhibitory for microbial saprotrophic growth. This work demonstrates that defining litter quality by C-13-CPMAS NMR improves our understanding of the substrate preferences of both plant and microbes for different litter types as well as for charred organic materials.

AB  - White-sand forests are thought to host many ectomycorrhizal fungi, as demonstrated by the numerous fruiting body collections made by Rolf Singer in the lower Rio Negro in the late 1970s. Despite recognition of the importance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in white-sand forests, there has not yet been a systematic examination of diversity and taxonomic composition across white-sand forests, or more widely across lowland Amazonian forests. In an effort to broaden our view of ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and distribution on white-sand forests, we collected ectomycorrhizal fruiting bodies in 10 plots of white-sand forests in Brazil and French Guiana between 2012 and 2014. We collected 221 specimens and 62 morphospecies, from the 10 plots, confirming that all studied white-sand forests host ectomycorrhizal fungi. Additionally, we searched for taxa associated with white sands among specimens deposited in Brazilian herbaria. We report 1006 unique ectomycorrhizal specimen records in 18 Brazilian herbaria, of which 137 specimens and 64 species are reported from white-sand forests, mainly in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Russulaceae and Amanitaceae were frequent in all habitats, and Cortinarius were more frequent on white sands. Our results highlight the high diversity and heterogeneity of ectomycorrhizal communities on white-sand forests, and the wide distribution of ectomycorrhizal fungi throughout Brazil, irrespective of soil type.

AB  - Rates of ecosystem nitrogen (N) cycling may be mediated by the presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which compete directly with free-living microbes for N. In the regenerating tropical dry forests of Central America, the distribution of ectomycorrhizal trees is affected by succession and soil parent material, both of which may exert independent influence over soil N fluxes. In order to quantify these interacting controls, we used a scale-explicit sampling strategy to examine soil N cycling at scales ranging from the microsite to ecosystem level. We measured fungal community composition, total and inorganic N pools, gross proteolytic rate, net N mineralization and microbial extracellular enzyme activity at multiple locations within 18 permanent plots that span dramatic gradients of soil N concentration, stand age and forest composition. The ratio of inorganic to organic N cycling was correlated with variation in fungal community structure, consistent with a strong influence of ectomycorrhiza on ecosystem-scale N cycling. However, on average, > 61\% of the variation in soil biogeochemistry occurred within plots, and the effects of forest composition were mediated by this local-scale heterogeneity in total soil N concentrations. These cross-scale interactions demonstrate the importance of a spatially explicit approach towards an understanding of controls on element cycling.

AB  - Background: Connections between mature trees and seedlings via ectomycorrhizal (EcM) hyphal networks existing in dipterocarp-dominated tropical rain forests of South- east Asia could have strong implications for seedling growth and survival and the maintenance of high diversity in such forests. Aim: To test whether EcM hyphal network connections are important for the growth and survival of dipterocarp seedlings. Methods: We conducted four independent experiments that prevented contact of experimental seedlings with an EcM network by using a series of fine meshes and/ or plastic barriers. We measured the growth and survival (and foliar delta C-13 in one experiment) of seedlings of six dipterocarp species over intervals ranging from 11 to 29 months. Results: Seedling growth (diameter, height or leaf number) was unaffected by exclusion from the EcM network in three experiments and there were no differences in foliar d13C values in the fourth. Seedling survival was reduced following exclusion from the EcM network in one experiment. Our results give little support to the hypothesis that dipterocarp seedlings growing in the shaded forest understorey benefit from being connected, through a common EcM network, to surrounding trees. Conclusions: We suggest that our negative results, in contrast to studies conducted in low diversity boreo- temperate or tropical forests, are due to these high diversity forests lacking host species-specific EcM fungi and therefore providing little opportunity for adaptive support of seedlings via hyphal networks.

AB  - Elevated nitrogen (N) deposition due to increased fossil fuel combustion and agricultural practices has altered global carbon (C) cycling. Additions of reactive N to N-limited environments are typically accompanied by increases in plant biomass. Soil C dynamics, however, have shown a range of different responses to the addition of reactive N that seem to be ecosystem dependent. We evaluated the effect of N amendments on biogeochemical characteristics and microbial responses of subalpine forest organic soils in order to develop a mechanistic understanding of how soils are affected by N amendments in subalpine ecosystems. We measured a suite of responses across three years (2011-2013) during two seasons (spring and fall). Following 17 years of N amehdments, fertilized soils were more acidic (control mean 5.09, fertilized mean 4.68), and had lower \%C (control mean 33.7\% C, fertilized mean 29.8\%.C) and microbial biomass C by 22\% relative to control plots. Shifts in biogeochemical properties in fertilized plots were associated with an altered microbial community driven by reduced arbuscular mycorrhizal (control mean 3.2 mol\%, fertilized mean 2.5 mol\%) and saprotrophic fungal groups (control mean 17.0 mol\%, fertilized mean 15.2 mol\%), as well as a decrease in N degrading microbial enzyme activity. Our results suggest that decreases in soil C in subalpine forests were in part driven by increased microbial degradation of soil organic matter and reduced inputs to soil organic matter in the form of microbial biomass.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi play a key role in mobilizing nutrients embedded in recalcitrant organic matter complexes, thereby increasing nutrient accessibility to the host plant. Recent studies have shown that during the assimilation of nutrients, the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus decomposes organic matter using an oxidative mechanism involving Fenton chemistry (Fe2+ + H2O2 + H+ -> Fe3+ + (OH)-O-center dot + H2O), similar to that of brown rot wood-decaying fungi. In such fungi, secreted metabolites are one of the components that drive one-electron reductions of Fe3+ and O-2, generating Fenton chemistry reagents. Here we investigated whether such a mechanism is also implemented by P. involutus during organic matter decomposition. Activity-guided purification was performed to isolate the Fe3+-reducing principle secreted by P. involutus during growth on a maize compost extract. The Fe3+-reducing activity correlated with the presence of one compound. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) identified this compound as the diarylcyclopentenone involutin. A major part of the involutin produced by P. involutus during organic matter decomposition was secreted into the medium, and the metabolite was not detected when the fungus was grown on a mineral nutrient medium. We also demonstrated that in the presence of H2O2, involutin has the capacity to drive an in vitro Fenton reaction via Fe3+ reduction. Our results show that the mechanism for the reduction of Fe3+ and the generation of hydroxyl radicals via Fenton chemistry by ectomycorrhizal fungi during organic matter decomposition is similar to that employed by the evolutionarily related brown rot saprotrophs during wood decay.

AB  - Plant invasion often increases stand biomass, but higher tissue quality (for example, less lignin and more nutrients) in invasive species might accelerate litter decomposition. This mechanism may minimize increases in soil carbon (C) sequestration despite higher production. Our knowledge about invasion and tissue quality is based on shoots, but roots contribute 50-90\% of biomass in vegetation types such as semiarid grasslands. Here we investigate root decomposition rates and tissue quality in the widespread invasive grass Agropyron cristatum, which doubles root mass but not soil C in the Great Plains of North America. Root length was significantly greater beneath Agropyron than native grassland 7 years after minirhizotron installation. However, CO2 evolution from decomposing roots was twice as much for Agropyron roots as for native grass roots (P < 0.05). CO2 evolution from decomposing native grass roots was not significantly different from controls with no root tissue added, suggesting that Agropyron invasion can convert grassland soil to a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Rapid root decomposition was associated with significantly lower lignin content in Agropyron roots than native grass roots, although root N and lignin:N ratios did not differ. We present the first report of root decomposition rates associated with plant invasion. Increases in root length were accompanied by increased root decomposition rates of low-lignin tissue, such that invasion-driven enhanced productivity did not enhance soil C sequestration. Among-species differences in root tissue quality and decomposition rates could influence soil C dynamics during invasions of systems dominated by belowground production, such as tundra, boreal forests, and semiarid grassland.

AB  - Earthworms (EWs) and mycorrhizal fungi are key components of soil biota participating in N recycling from leaf litter. The extent to which their interactions impact leaf litter-derived N uptake by tree species colonized by different mycorrhizal types and the variation of these interactions with leaf litter quality is unknown. We used a greenhouse experiment to investigate the effects of EWs on plant acquisition of N from N-15 enriched ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) leaf litter. We employed arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) ash and ectomycorrhizal (EM) beech trees. EW presence did not affect the overall root mycorrhizal colonization, but in the beech leaf litter treatment it caused a shift in the EM fungal community, favoring species with a ruderal life strategy at the expense of more specialized species able to degrade organic compounds. No differences in N-15 capture were found between EM and AM plants. Generally, 2-7\% of the N released from leaf litter was taken up by the plants. EWs uniformly increased plant acquisition of N from leaf litter. This effect was more pronounced in treatments with ash than in those with beech leaf litter, presumably because of higher degradability of ash than of beech litter. The results suggest that leaf litter quality dominates the impact of EWs on plant N acquisition from leaf litter while the mycorrhizal type is of minor importance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fungal communities have been shown to be highly sensitive toward shifts in plant diversity and species composition in forest ecosystems. However, little is known about the impact of forest management on fungal diversity and community composition of geographically separated sites. This study examined the effects of four different forest management types on soil fungal communities. These forest management types include age class forests of young managed beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), with beech stands age of approximately 30 years, age class beech stands with an age of approximately 70 years, unmanaged beech stands, and coniferous stands dominated by either pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) or spruce (Picea abies Karst.) which are located in three study sites across Germany. Soil were sampled from 48 study plots and we employed fungal ITS rDNA pyrotag sequencing to assess the soil fungal diversity and community structure. We found that forest management type significantly affects the Shannon diversity of soil fungi and a significant interaction effect of study site and forest management on the fungal operational taxonomic units richness. Consequently distinct fungal communities were detected in the three study sites and within the four forest management types, which were mainly related to the main tree species. Further analysis of the contribution of soil properties revealed that C/N ratio being the most important factor in all the three study sites whereas soil pH was significantly related to the fungal community in two study sites. Functional assignment of the fungal communities indicated that 38\% of the observed communities were Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) and their distribution is significantly influenced by the forest management. Soil pH and C/N ratio were found to be the main drivers of the ECM fungal community composition. Additional fungal community similarity analysis revealed the presence of study site and management type specific ECM genera. This study extends our knowledge on the impact of forest management type on general and ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and community structure in temperate forests. High plasticity across management types but also study site specific spatial distribution revealed new insights in the ECM fungal distribution patterns.

AB  - Tree neighbourhoods can complicate the prediction of plant belowground responses to elevated CO2. We studied the effects of elevated CO2 on the root traits, soil microbial communities, and microbial extracellular enzyme activities in the rhizospheres of Abies faxoniana saplings grown alone or with different neighbouring species. A. faxoniana (alone), A. faxoniana grown with dwarf bamboo (Fargesia rufa), and A. faxoniana grown with biocrusts were exposed to ambient or to CO2-enriched air (ambient + 350 mu mol mol(-1)) for six years. The CO2 x neighbourhood interaction significantly affected A. faxoniana saplings growth, soil microbial communities, and soil enzyme activities. Elevated CO2 had relatively little effect on plant and microbial biomass and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles in saplings grown alone. However, increased ectomycorrhizal colonization was observed in the roots of these saplings. Results suggested that the growth of saplings grown with biocrusts under elevated CO2 conditions was obtained by the enhanced soil microbial characteristics, whereas the positive effects of elevated CO2 on ectomycorrhizal fungi colonization in saplings grown alone could not delay or alleviate the progressive nitrogen (N) limitation as is evidenced by similar plant biomass under elevated and ambient CO2 treatments. In contrast, elevated CO2 significantly decreased the growth of A. faxoniana in the presence of dwarf bamboo, and this reduction was accompanied by decreased soil and leaf N concentrations, microbial biomass carbon (C) and N, labile C, and total PLFA. We propose that the depletion of the C pool and the reduction in the soil microbial metabolic activities in saplings grown with dwarf bamboo may limit the rates of decomposition to release nutrients from organic matter for plant growth. These results suggest that neighbouring plants have belowground feedback that potentially contributes to plant performance. On the other hand, the results of the present study also showed that the responses of soil organic C to elevated CO2 are different in the presence and absence of neighbours and dependent on neighbour identity. Only mesocosms with biocrust had a tendency to maintain more soil organic C by increased soil microbial community abundance. Our results also highlight the value of studying elevated CO2 effects on aboveground-belowground associations to improve the prediction of subalpine ecosystem functioning under climate changes.

AB  - Dendroctonus ponderosae has killed millions of Pinus contorta in western North America with subsequent effects on stand conditions, including changes in light intensity, needle deposition, and the composition of fungal community mutualists, namely ectomycorrhizal fungi. It is unknown whether these changes in stand conditions will have cascading consequences for the next generation of pine seedlings. To test for transgenerational cascades on pine seedlings, we tested the effects of fungal inoculum origin (beetle-killed or undisturbed stands), light intensity and litter (origin and presence) on seedling secondary chemistry and growth in a glasshouse. We also tracked survival of seedlings over two growing seasons in the same stands from which fungi and litter were collected. Fungal communities differed by inoculum origin. Seedlings grown with fungi collected from beetle-killed stands had lower monoterpene concentrations and fewer monoterpene compounds present compared with seedlings grown with fungi collected from undisturbed stands. Litter affected neither monoterpenes nor seedling growth. Seedling survival in the field was lower in beetle-killed than in undisturbed stands. We demonstrate that stand mortality caused by prior beetle attacks of mature pines have cascading effects on seedling secondary chemistry, growth and survival, probably mediated through effects on below-ground mutualisms.

AB  - Forest fires are a common natural disturbance in forested ecosystems and have a large impact on the microbial communities in forest soils. The response of soil fungal communities to forest fire is poorly documented. Here, we investigated fungal community structure and function across a 152-year boreal forest fire chronosequence using high-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region and a functional gene array (GeoChip). Our results demonstrate that the boreal forest soil fungal community was most diverse soon after a fire disturbance and declined over time. The differences in the fungal communities were explained by changes in the abundance of basidiomycetes and ascomycetes. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi contributed to the increase in basidiomycete abundance over time, with the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) representing the genera Cortinarius and Piloderma dominating in abundance. Hierarchical cluster analysis by using gene signal intensity revealed that the sites with different fire histories formed separate clusters, suggesting differences in the potential to maintain essential biogeochemical soil processes. The site with the greatest biological diversity had also the most diverse genes. The genes involved in organic matter degradation in the mature forest, in which ECM fungi were the most abundant, were as common in the youngest site, in which saprotrophic fungi had a relatively higher abundance. This study provides insight into the impact of fire disturbance on soil fungal community dynamics.

AB  - Soil nitrogen (N) availability constrains future predictions of ecosystem primary productivity and carbon storage. The progressive N limitation (PNL) hypothesis predicts that forest net primary productivity (NPP) will decline with age, and that the response of NPP to elevated CO2 will attenuate through time due to negative feedbacks of NPP on the soil N cycle. A central assumption of the PNL hypothesis is that, without changes in exogenous exchange of N in an ecosystem, increases in plant N uptake require increased soil N cycling rates. However, at ecosystem scale, microbial N uptake exceeds plant uptake. Hence, a change in the partitioning of N between plants and soil microorganisms may represent an alternative mechanism to sustain plant N uptake in the face of PNL. To estimate N partitioning of total N cycling between plants and microbes, we measured and modeled growth and N uptake of trees, bacteria, saprotrophic fungi, and ectomycorrhizal fungi across a forest succession and N limitation gradient. The combined plant and ectomycorrhizal N uptake increased from early to late succession, and nearly matched saprotrophic N uptake in late successional sites, while total N cycling remained stable or even declined. Changes in microbial community structure can thus mediate a redistribution of ecosystem nitrogen cycling, allowing an increase in plant N uptake without concomitant increases in soil N cycling. We further suggest that microbe-mediated changes in N partitioning can delay PNL and may thereby act as a mechanism to extend the duration of the land carbon sink in response to rising atmospheric CO2.

AB  - We studied ground vegetation dynamics during the decline and recovery of mountain Norway spruce forests damaged by SO2 air pollution and associated stress factors. Changes in areal extent of the ground vegetation dominants, moss layer and spruce litter and trajectories of these changes, recorded at a spatial resolution of 5 x 5 cm, were analysed in 1-m(2) squares located in plots differing in dynamics of spruce canopy cover. Spruce litter patches diminished during spruce stand decline being colonised by Avenella flexuosa, Calamagrostis villosa (in canopy gaps) and Vaccinium myrtillus (under gradually defoliating tree crowns). After several years of spatially dynamic coexistence of the grasses, C. villosa began to retreat being replaced by A. flexuosa. Vaccinium myrtillus then re-entered these grass stands. In less affected spruce stands, the dominants partially retreated without competing with other ground vegetation. Moreover, the applied GIS spatio-temporal analysis revealed substantial spatial movements of the dominants over the plots.

AB  - Microbes such as fungi and bacteria play fundamental roles in litter-decay and nutrient-cycling; however, their communities may respond differently than plants to climate change. The structure (diversity, richness, and evenness) and composition of microbial communities in climate transects of mature Douglas-fir stands of coastal British Columbia rainshadow forests was analyzed, in order to assess in situ variability due to different temperature and moisture regimes. We compared denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fungi (18S-FF390/FR1), nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NifHuniversal) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AmoA) polymerase chain reaction amplicons in forest floor and mineral soil samples from three transects located at different latitudes, each transect spanning the Coastal Western Hemlock and Douglas-fir biogeoclimatic zones. Composition of microbial communities in both soil layers was related to degree days above 0 degrees C (2725-3489), while pH (3.8-5.5) best explained shifts in community structure. At this spatial scale, climatic conditions were likely to directly or indirectly select for different microbial species while local site heterogeneity influenced community structure. Significant changes in microbial community composition and structure were related to differences as small as 2.47\% and 2.55 degrees C in mean annual moisture and temperature variables, respectively. The climatic variables best describing microbial composition changed from one functional group to the next; in general they did not alter community structure. Spatial distance, especially associated with latitude, was also important in accounting for community variability (4-23\%); but to a lesser extent than the combined influence of climate and soil characteristics (14-25\%). Results suggest that in situ climate can independently account for some patterns of microbial biogeography in coastal Douglas-fir forests. The distribution of up to 43\% of nutrientcycling microorganisms detected in forest soils responded to smaller abiotic gradients than host trees.

AB  - Several laboratory experiments and field observations demonstrate that saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi effectively use pollen cytoplasm and suggest pollen produced by wind-pollinated trees as a crucial nutrient source for fungi and their plant hosts in nutrient-limited environments. However, the role of such interactions is still underestimated or neglected in ecology and paleoecology. Here, we consider pollen attacked by fungi in palynological records from Holocene raised peat bogs as a nutrient source for ecosystems in the past. The attacks occurred through the pollen germination areas by a variety of saprotrophic, ericoid mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal or dark septate endophyte fungi. Large amounts of attacked pollen in phases rich in Calluna vulgaris highlight the importance of Ericaceae shrubs, hosting ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and forming hotspots of decomposition in nutrient-deficit bogs. Applying estimations of pollen rain from literature, and based on own observed pollen infection rates we estimate the annual release of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium from pollen, and highlight their significance in pushing the ecosystem nutrient cycle in early spring time, when several species release their pollen. We highlight the significant role of anthropogenic changes in pollen deposition for pre-industrial bogs and hypothesize about the consequences of the pollen-based interrelation between wind-pollinated plants and their mycorrhizal fungi in paleoecology and evolution.

AB  - Priority effects are an important ecological force shaping biotic communities and ecosystem processes, in which the establishment of early colonists alters the colonization success of later-arriving organisms via competitive exclusion and habitat modification. However, we do not understand which biotic and abiotic conditions lead to strong priority effects and lasting historical contingencies. Using saprotrophic fungi in a model leaf decomposition system, we investigated whether compositional and functional consequences of initial colonization were dependent on initial colonizer traits, resource availability or a combination thereof. To test these ideas, we factorially manipulated leaf litter biochemistry and initial fungal colonist identity, quantifying subsequent community composition, using neutral genetic markers, and community functional characteristics, including enzyme potential and leaf decay rates. During the first 3months, initial colonist respiration rate and physiological capacity to degrade plant detritus were significant determinants of fungal community composition and leaf decay, indicating that rapid growth and lignolytic potential of early colonists contributed to altered trajectories of community assembly. Further, initial colonization on oak leaves generated increasingly divergent trajectories of fungal community composition and enzyme potential, indicating stronger initial colonizer effects on energy-poor substrates. Together, these observations provide evidence that initial colonization effects, and subsequent consequences on litter decay, are dependent upon substrate biochemistry and physiological traits within a regional species pool. Because microbial decay of plant detritus is important to global C storage, our results demonstrate that understanding the mechanisms by which initial conditions alter priority effects during community assembly may be key to understanding the drivers of ecosystem-level processes.

AB  - A significant fraction of carbon stored in the Earth's soil moves through arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and ectomycorrhiza (EM). The impacts of AM and EM on the soil carbon budget are poorly understood. We propose a method to quantify the mycorrhizal contribution to carbon cycling, explicitly accounting for the abundance of plant-associated and extraradical mycorrhizal mycelium. We discuss the need to acquire additional data to use our method, and present our new global database holding information on plant species-by-site intensity of root colonization by mycorrhizas. We demonstrate that the degree of mycorrhizal fungal colonization has globally consistent patterns across plant species. This suggests that the level of plant species-specific root colonization can be used as a plant trait. To exemplify our method, we assessed the differential impacts of AM:EM ratio and EM shrub encroachment on carbon stocks in sub-arctic tundra. AM and EM affect tundra carbon stocks at different magnitudes, and via partly distinct dominant pathways: via extraradical mycelium (both EM and AM) and via mycorrhizal impacts on above- and belowground biomass carbon (mostly AM). Our method provides a powerful tool for the quantitative assessment of mycorrhizal impact on local and global carbon cycling processes, paving the way towards an improved understanding of the role of mycorrhizas in the Earth's carbon cycle.

AB  - Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment can alter N dynamics associated with decomposing plant litter. However, it is unclear to what extent these alterations occur via microbial effects (e.g., changes in gene regulation, physiology, or community composition) versus plant litter effects (e.g., changes in composition of N and C compounds). To isolate microbial effects from plant litter effects, we collected plant litter from long-term N fertilized and control plots, reciprocally inoculated it with microbes from the two treatments, and incubated it in a common field setting for three months. We used quantum dots (QDs) to track fungal uptake of glycine and chitosan. Glycine is a relatively simple organic N compound; chitosan is more complex. We found that microbial and litter origins each contributed to a shift in fungal uptake capacities under N fertilization. Specifically, N fungi preferred glycine over chitosan, but control fungi did not. In comparison, litter effects were more subtle, and manifested as a three-way interaction between litter origin, microbial origin, and type of organic N (glycine versus chitosan). In particular, control fungi tended to target chitosan only when incubated with control litter, while N fungi targeted glycine regardless of litter type. Overall, microbial effects may mediate how N dynamics respond to anthropogenic N enrichment in ecosystems.

Although the effects of forest conversion have been studied in a wide range of taxonomic groups, the effects on macrofungal communities remain poorly understood. We sampled macrofungal fruiting bodies in the National Forest of SAo Francisco de Paula in Southern Brazil over 12 months in four different forest habitats: native Araucaria angustifolia forest, A.angustifolia plantation, Pinus taeda or P.elliottii plantation, and Eucalyptus saligna plantation. The distribution of macrofungal species in different functional groups varied among habitats: the macrofungal species composition of the A.angustifolia plantation was more similar to that of the native forest, while the exotic Pinus or Eucalyptus plantations were less similar to the native forest. The conversion of native forest to exotic tree plantations reduced the number of macrofungal decomposer species, probably due to changes in substrate availability and quality. We conclude that fungal diversity and ecosystem functionality require the preservation of native, mature forests and suggest a shift of Brazilian forestry guidelines to encourage the plantations of native species instead of exotics. Resumo A conversAo de florestas nativas para monoculturas de arvores e uma ameaca constante a biodiversidade em todo o mundo. Apesar de estudos terem avaliado os efeitos da conversAo de florestas para uma variedade de grupos taxonomicos, os efeitos sobre especies de macrofungos e sua diversidade funcional ainda sAo pouco conhecidos. Nos amostramos frutificacoes de macrofungos na Floresta Nacional de SAo Francisco de Paula no sul do Brasil durante doze meses em quatro diferentes habitats florestais: floresta nativa com Araucaria angustifolia, plantacoes de A. angustifolia, bem como plantacoes de especies exoticas de Eucalyptus saligna e plantacoes de Pinus taeda e P. elliottii. A distribuicAo das especies de macrofungos difere nos grupos funcionais e varia entre os ambientes. A composicAo de especies de macrofungos na plantacAo de A. angustifolia mostrou maior similaridade com a floresta nativa do que com outras plantacoes de arvores, enquanto as plantacoes de arvores exoticas sAo mais dissimilares da floresta nativa. A conversAo de floresta nativa para plantacoes de especies exoticas reduziu o numero de especies decompositoras, provavelmente devido a alteracoes na qualidade e disponibilidade de substratos. Nos concluimos que a diversidade de macrofungos e a funcionalidade do ecossistema requerem a preservacAo de florestas nativas primarias, bem como uma mudanca nas diretrizes de silvicultura no Brasil para encorajar o plantio de arvores nativas no lugar das exoticas.

AB  - Soil microorganisms regulate fundamental biochemical processes in plant litter decomposition and soil organic matter (SOM) transformations. Understanding how microbial communities respond to changes in vegetation is critical for improving predictions of how land-cover change affects belowground carbon storage and nutrient availability. We measured intra-and interannual variability in soil and forest litter microbial community composition and activity via phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) and extracellular enzyme activity across a well-replicated, long-term chronosequence of secondary forests growing on abandoned pastures in the wet subtropical forest life zone of Puerto Rico. Microbial community PLFA structure differed between young secondary forests and older secondary and primary forests, following successional shifts in tree species composition. These successional patterns held across seasons, but the microbial groups driving these patterns differed over time. Microbial community composition from the forest litter differed greatly from those in the soil, but did not show the same successional trends. Extracellular enzyme activity did not differ with forest succession, but varied by season with greater rates of potential activity in the dry seasons. We found few robust significant relationships among microbial community parameters and soil pH, moisture, carbon, and nitrogen concentrations. Observed inter- and intrannual variability in microbial community structure and activity reveal the importance of a multiple, temporal sampling strategy when investigating microbial community dynamics with land-use change. Successional control over microbial composition with forest recovery suggests strong links between above and belowground communities.

AB  - Linking community composition to ecosystem function is a challenge in complex microbial communities. We tested the hypothesis that key biological features of fungi - evolutionary history, functional guild, and abundance of functional genes can predict the biogeochemical activity of fungal species during decay. We measured the activity of 10 different enzymes produced by 48 model fungal species on leaf litter in laboratory microcosms. Taxa included closely related species with different ecologies (i.e. species in different ``functional guilds{'' and species with publicly available genomes. Decomposition capabilities differed less among phylogenetic lineages of fungi than among different functional guilds. Activity of carbohydrases and acid phosphatase was significantly higher in litter colonized by saprotrophs compared to ectomycorrhizal species. By contrast, oxidoreductase activities per unit fungal biomass were statistically similar across functional guilds, with white rot fungi having highest polyphenol oxidase activity and ectomycorrhizal fungi having highest peroxidase activity. On the ecosystem level, polyphenol oxidase activity in soil correlated with the abundance of white rot fungi, while soil peroxidase activity correlated with the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in soil. Copy numbers of genes coding for different enzymes explained the activity of some tarbohydrases and polyphenol oxidase produced by fungi in culture, but were not significantly better predictors of activity than specific functional guild. Collectively, our data suggest that quantifying the specific functional guilds of fungi in soil, potentially through environmental sequencing approaches, allows us to predict activity of enzymes that drive soil biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - Long-term fertilization is being considered as a mechanism to increase growth of pine and spruce trees in British Columbia following a major outbreak of mountain pine beetle. It is important, however, that long-term fertilization not disrupt colonization by ectomycorrhizal fungi or impede their ability to release nutrients from soil organic matter. In order to determine the effect of long-term (up to 14 years) fertilization on the structure and function of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities on roots of interior spruce, we characterized the ECM fungal community and, on separate samples collected at a different time of year, assayed for extracellular enzymes in the mycorrhizoplane. The study was conducted at three interior spruce (naturally occurring hybrids of Picea glauca {[}Moench] Voss and Picea engelmannii Parry) plantations in the interior of south-central British Columbia. Three 0.164 ha plots per site received no (controls), periodic (200 kg ha-1 N, plus P, K, S, Mg, and B every 6 years), or annual (same nutrients adjusted to maintain foliar N concentration at 1.3\% and other nutrients in balance; 50 to 75 kg ha(-1) of N, depending on site and year) fertilization. There was no overall effect of fertilization on the composition of the ECM fungal community (OTUs) on spruce roots (permutational MANOVA P = 0.4) nor on alpha diversity per plot. At single sites, there was reduced relative abundance of Cortinarius spp. mycorrhizas under periodic fertilization, and increased relative abundance of Lactarius spp. or Tylospora spp. mycorrhizas under annual fertilization. None of the dominant genera increased or decreased significantly across sites. The ratio of carbon-acquiring to mineral nutrient-acquiring enzyme activities in the mycorrhizoplanes increased with frequency of fertilizer application. Increased litterfall may explain the increase in plant cell wall-degrading enzyme activity in fertilized plots. A decrease in activities involved in the release of sulphur was as expected in fertilized plots because the fertilizer contained inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. Although activities of two enzymes involved in nutrient cycling (sulfatase and phosphomonoesterase) tended to decrease, there did not appear to be an overall loss of organic matter-degrading potential from the ECM fungal community on spruce roots under long-term fertilization.

AB  - It is proposed that carbon (C) sequestration in response to reactive nitrogen (N-r) deposition in boreal forests accounts for a large portion of the terrestrial sink for anthropogenic CO2 emissions. While studies have helped clarify the magnitude by which N-r deposition enhances C sequestration by forest vegetation, there remains a paucity of long-term experimental studies evaluating how soil C pools respond. We conducted a long-term experiment, maintained since 1996, consisting of three N addition levels (0, 12.5, and 50kgNha(-1)yr(-1)) in the boreal zone of northern Sweden to understand how atmospheric N-r deposition affects soil C accumulation, soil microbial communities, and soil respiration. We hypothesized that soil C sequestration will increase, and soil microbial biomass and soil respiration will decrease, with disproportionately large changes expected compared to low levels of N addition. Our data showed that the low N addition treatment caused a non-significant increase in the organic horizon C pool of similar to 15\% and a significant increase of similar to 30\% in response to the high N treatment relative to the control. The relationship between C sequestration and N addition in the organic horizon was linear, with a slope of 10kgCkg(-1)N. We also found a concomitant decrease in total microbial and fungal biomasses and a similar to 11\% reduction in soil respiration in response to the high N treatment. Our data complement previous data from the same study system describing aboveground C sequestration, indicating a total ecosystem sequestration rate of 26kgCkg(-1)N. These estimates are far lower than suggested by some previous modeling studies, and thus will help improve and validate current modeling efforts aimed at separating the effect of multiple global change factors on the C balance of the boreal region.

AB  - Changes in plant cover after afforestation induce variations in litter inputs and soil microbial community structure and activity, which may promote the accrual and physical-chemical protection of soil organic carbon (SOC) within soil aggregates. In a long-term experiment (20 years) we have studied the effects, on soil aggregation and SOC stabilization, of two afforestation techniques: a) amended terraces with organic refuse (AT), and b) terraces without organic amendment (T). We used the adjacent shrubland (S) as control. Twenty years after stand establishment, aggregate distribution (including microaggregates within larger aggregates), sensitive and slow organic carbon (OC) fractions, basal respiration in macroaggregates, and microbial community structure were measured. The main changes occurred in the top layer (0-5 cm), where: i) both the sensitive and slow OC fractions were increased in AT compared to S and T, ii) the percentage and OC content of microaggregates within macroaggregates (Mm) were higher in AT than in S and T, iii) basal respiration in macroaggregates was also higher in AT, and iv) significant changes in the fungal (rather than bacterial) community structure were observed in the afforested soils (AT and T) - compared to the shrubland soil. These results suggest that the increase in OC pools linked to the changes in microbial activity and fungal community structure, after afforestation, promoted the formation of macroaggregates - which acted as the nucleus for the formation and stabilization of OC-enriched microaggregates.

AB  - Distinctive plant communities may provide specific physical and chemical properties with soils by specific litters and root exudates to exert effects on soil microorganisms. Past logging activities in the Qinling Mountains induced diverse natural secondary forest types (NSFTs). How these recovered NSFTs regulate patterns of soil microbial communities remain limited. In the study, we used terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) to precisely determine forest type-specific soil fungal diversity and composition in five NSFTs. Our results indicated that NSFTs had significant impacts on the soil fungal communities. The most diverse fungal species were found in the Armand pine (Pinus armandi) and Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) forest soils, followed by sharptooth oak (Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata) and Chinese pine-sharptooth oak forest soils, the wilson spruce (Picea wilsonii) forests had the lowest soil fungal diversity. The analyses of community composition suggested that the fungal communities of Armand pine forest soils were similar to those of Chinese pine forest soils, while other communities prominently differed from each other. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that soil silt, clay, pH, and ammonium nitrogen had intimate linkages with soil fungal diversity. Furthermore, the patterns of soil fungal communites were strongly governed by the specific soil environments of the tested NSFTs, as described by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Finally, our study showed that soil fungal communities may be mediated by NSFTs via specific soil edaphic status. Hence, such a comparable study may provide fundamental information for fungal diversity and community structure of natural forests and assist with better prediction and understanding how soil fungal composition and function alter with forest type transformation.

AB  - Commercial harvesting of matsutake in Finland has driven the need to understand how fruiting is affected by climate and habitat. A productive site in Finland was studied in this respect. Productivity, duration, and early onset of fruiting were examined in relation to mean air temperature, soil temperature, accumulated degree-days, and precipitation. We monitored the fruiting of matsutake and other macrofungi during 2008-2013. As a pilot study, our results showed the timing and yield of the annual fruiting of Tricholoma matsutake varies in Southern Finland and can occur from the middle of July to middle of September; although we did not find a clear and simple correlation between fruiting and rainfall, an average amount of precipitation (i.e. 90-110\% of the long-term average precipitation) prior to the first fruiting was associated with high yield; we did not identify any threshold soil temperature associated with the onset of fruiting, however, we found that soil temperature might provide a means to monitor the end of the matsutake fruiting period, and late onset or higher soil temperatures prior to the first fruiting were associated with shorter fruiting periods. These results can be further utilized for developing a model to predict the yield of T. matsutake in Nordic regions.

AB  - Climate warming at high northern latitudes has caused substantial increases in plant productivity of tundra vegetation and an expansion of the range of deciduous shrub species. However significant the increase in carbon (C) contained within above-ground shrub biomass, it is modest in comparison with the amount of C stored in the soil in tundra ecosystems. Here, we use a space-for-time' approach to test the hypothesis that a shift from lower-productivity tundra heath to higher-productivity deciduous shrub vegetation in the sub-Arctic may lead to a loss of soil C that out-weighs the increase in above-ground shrub biomass. We further hypothesize that a shift from ericoid to ectomycorrhizal systems coincident with this vegetation change provides a mechanism for the loss of soil C. We sampled soil C stocks, soil surface CO2 flux rates and fungal growth rates along replicated natural transitions from birch forest (Betula pubescens), through deciduous shrub tundra (Betula nana) to tundra heaths (Empetrum nigrum) near Abisko, Swedish Lapland. We demonstrate that organic horizon soil organic C (SOCorg) is significantly lower at shrub (2.98 +/- 0.48kgm(-2)) and forest (2.04 +/- 0.25kgm(-2)) plots than at heath plots (7.03 +/- 0.79kgm(-2)). Shrub vegetation had the highest respiration rates, suggesting that despite higher rates of C assimilation, C turnover was also very high and less C is sequestered in the ecosystem. Growth rates of fungal hyphae increased across the transition from heath to shrub, suggesting that the action of ectomycorrhizal symbionts in the scavenging of organically bound nutrients is an important pathway by which soil C is made available to microbial degradation. The expansion of deciduous shrubs onto potentially vulnerable arctic soils with large stores of C could therefore represent a significant positive feedback to the climate system.

AB  - Human land use alters soil microbial composition and function in a variety of systems, although few comparable studies have been done in tropical forests and tropical agricultural production areas. Logging and the expansion of oil palm agriculture are two of the most significant drivers of tropical deforestation, and the latter is most prevalent in Southeast Asia. The aim of this study was to compare soil fungal communities from three sites in Malaysia that represent three of the most dominant land-use types in the Southeast Asia tropics: a primary forest, a regenerating forest that had been selectively logged 50 years previously, and a 25-year-old oil palm plantation. Soil cores were collected from three replicate plots at each site, and fungal communities were sequenced using the Illumina platform. Extracellular enzyme assays were assessed as a proxy for soil microbial function. We found that fungal communities were distinct across all sites, although fungal composition in the regenerating forest was more similar to the primary forest than either forest community was to the oil palm site. Ectomycorrhizal fungi, which are important associates of the dominant Dipterocarpaceae tree family in this region, were compositionally distinct across forests, but were nearly absent from oil palm soils. Extracellular enzyme assays indicated that the soil ecosystem in oil palm plantations experienced altered nutrient cycling dynamics, but there were few differences between regenerating and primary forest soils. Together, these results show that logging and the replacement of primary forest with oil palm plantations alter fungal community and function, although forests regenerating from logging had more similarities with primary forests in terms of fungal composition and nutrient cycling potential. Since oil palm agriculture is currently the mostly rapidly expanding equatorial crop and logging is pervasive across tropical ecosystems, these findings may have broad applicability.

AB  - The relative amounts of hyphal inoculum in forest soils may determine the capacity for fungi to compete with and replace early colonizers of wood in ground contact. Our aim in this study was to test the flexibility of priority effects (colonization timing) by varying the timing of inoculum introduction (i.e., precolonization) and amount of inoculum (i.e., inoculum potential). We controlled these variables in soil-block microcosms using fungi with known competitive outcomes in similar conditions, tracking isolate-specific fungal biomass, and residue physiochemistry over time. In the precolonization trial (experiment I), a brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum was given 1, 3, or 5 weeks to precolonize wood blocks (oak, birch, pine, and spruce) prior the introduction of a white rot fungus, Irpex lacteus, a more aggressive colonizer in this set-up. In the inoculum potential trial (experiment II), the fungi were inoculated simultaneously, but with eightfold higher brown rot inoculum than that of experiment I. As expected, longer precolonization duration increased the chance for the less-competitive brown rot fungus to outcompete its white rot opponent. Higher brown rot fungal inoculum outside of the wood matrix also resulted in competitive success for the brown rot isolate in most cases. These temporal shifts in fungal dominance were detectable in a `community snapshot' as isolate-specific quantitative PCR, but also as functionally-relevant consequences of wood rot type, including carbohydrate depolymerization and pH. These results from a controlled system reinforce fungal-fungal interaction and suggest that relative inoculum availability beyond the wood matrix (i.e., soils) might regulate the duration of priority effects and shift the functional trajectory of wood decomposition.

AB  - Hyperdiverse forests occur in the lowland tropics, whereas the most species-rich shrublands are found in regions such as south-western Australia (kwongan) and South Africa (fynbos). Despite large differences, these ecosystems share an important characteristic: their soils are strongly weathered and phosphorus (P) is a key growth-limiting nutrient. Soil-borne pathogens are increasingly being recognized as drivers of plant diversity in lowland tropical rainforests, but have received little attention in species-rich shrublands. We suggest a trade-off in which the species most proficient at acquiring P have ephemeral roots that are particularly susceptible to soil-borne pathogens. This could equalize out the differences in competitive ability among co-occurring species in these ecosystems, thus contributing to coexistence. Moreover, effective protection against soil-borne pathogens by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi might explain the occurrence of monodominant stands of ECM trees and shrubs amongst otherwise species-rich communities. We identify gaps in our knowledge which need to be filled in order to evaluate a possible link between P limitation, fine root traits, soil-borne pathogens and local plant species diversity. Such a link may help to explain how numerous plant species can coexist in hyperdiverse rainforests and shrublands, and, conversely, how monodominant stands can develop in these ecosystems.

AB  - Soil horizons below 30 cm depth contain about 60\% of the organic carbon stored in soils. Although insight into the physical and chemical stabilization of soil organic matter (SUM) and into microbial community composition in these horizons is being gained, information on microbial functions of subsoil microbial communities and on associated microbially-mediated processes remains sparse. To identify possible controls on enzyme patterns, we correlated enzyme patterns with biotic and abiotic soil parameters, as well as with microbial community composition, estimated using phospholipid fatty acid profiles. Enzyme patterns (i.e. distance-matrixes calculated from these enzyme activities) were calculated from the activities of six extracellular enzymes (cellobiohydrolase, leucine-amino-peptidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, chitotriosidase, phosphatase and phenoloxidase), which had been measured in soil samples from organic topsoil horizons, mineral topsoil horizons, and mineral subsoil horizons from seven ecosystems along a 1500 km latitudinal transect in Western Siberia. We found that hydrolytic enzyme activities decreased rapidly with depth, whereas oxidative enzyme activities in mineral horizons were as high as, or higher than in organic topsoil horizons. Enzyme patterns varied more strongly between ecosystems in mineral subsoil horizons than in organic topsoils. The enzyme patterns in topsoil horizons were correlated with SUM content (i.e., C and N content) and microbial community composition. In contrast, the enzyme patterns in mineral subsoil horizons were related to water content, soil pH and microbial community composition. The lack of correlation between enzyme patterns and SUM quantity in the mineral subsoils suggests that SOM chemistry, spatial separation or physical stabilization of SUM rather than SUM content might determine substrate availability for enzymatic breakdown. The correlation of microbial community composition and enzyme patterns in all horizons, suggests that microbial community composition shapes enzyme patterns and might act as a modifier for the usual dependency of decomposition rates on SUM content or C/N ratios.

AB  - Fungal communities in Norway spruce (Picea abies) logs in two forests in Sweden were investigated by 454-sequence analyses and by examining the ecological roles of the detected taxa. We also investigated the relationship between fruit bodies and mycelia in wood and whether community assembly was affected by how the dead wood was formed. Fungal communities were highly variable in terms of phylogenetic composition and ecological roles: 1910 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected; 21\% were identified to species level. In total, 58\% of the OTUs were ascomycetes and 31\% basidiomycetes. Of the 231 337 reads, 38\% were ascomycetes and 60\% basidiomycetes. Ecological roles were assigned to 35\% of the OTUs, accounting for 62\% of the reads. Wood-decaying fungi were the most common group; however, other saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, lichenized, parasitic and endophytic fungi were also common. Fungal communities in logs formed by stem breakage were different to those in logs originating from butt breakage or uprooting. DNA of specific species was detected in logs many years after the last recorded fungal fruiting. Combining taxonomic identification with knowledge of ecological roles may provide valuable insights into properties of fungal communities; however, precise ecological information about many fungal species is still lacking.

AB  - Although hypothesized for many years, the involvement of ectomycorrhizal fungi in decomposition of soil organic matter remains controversial and has not yet been fully acknowledged as an important factor in the regulation of soil carbon (C) storage. Here, we review recent findings, which support the view that some ectomycorrhizal fungi have the capacity to oxidize organic matter, either by brown-rot' Fenton chemistry or using white-rot' peroxidases. We propose that ectomycorrhizal fungi benefit from organic matter decomposition primarily through increased nitrogen mobilization rather than through release of metabolic C and question the view that ectomycorrhizal fungi may act as facultative saprotrophs. Finally, we discuss how mycorrhizal decomposition may influence organic matter storage in soils and mediate responses of ecosystem C sequestration to environmental changes.

AB  - Eucalyptus obliqua, the most widespread timber tree in Tasmania, is a pioneer after fire which can eliminate the organic layer of forest soil, exposing the underlying mineral soil. We compared seedling growth, mycorrhiza formation, and mineral nutrient limitation in organic layer vs. mineral soil. We grew E. obliqua seedlings separately in pots of organic layer and mineral soil in a glasshouse. Additional treatments of organic soil only, involved fully crossed methyl-bromide fumigation and fertilization. Fertilization comprised chelated iron for 121 days after transplant (DAT) followed by soluble phosphorus. At 357 DAT, whole plant dry weight was three times greater in ambient organic than in mineral soil. In organic soil, fumigation halved ectomycorrhiza abundance and reduced seedling growth at 149 DAT, but by 357 DAT when negative effects of fumigation on seedling growth had disappeared, neither fumigation nor fertilization affected mycorrhiza abundance. Iron fertilization diminished seedling growth, but subsequent phosphorus fertilization improved it. E. obliqua seedlings grow much better in organic layer soil than in mineral soil, although phosphorus remains limiting. The prevalent forestry practice of burning to mineral soil after timber harvest exposes a poor growth medium likely only partially compensated by fire-induced mineral soil alterations

AB  - The diversity, vegetative and reproductive characteristics, and phenology of litter decomposing macrofungi (LDM) were compared between humus forms and climatic regions. Fruiting bodies of LDM were examined for the forest floor of subtropical (ST), cool temperate (CT), and subalpine (SA) forests in Japan. Field surveys during one growing season yielded 35, 32, and 18 species in ST, CT, and SA, respectively. Species richness was generally higher in mull than in moder humus and in a warmer than in a cooler climate. A total of ten fungal families were observed, and species in the Mycenaceae dominated in the LDM assemblages at all study sites. A larger number of species fruited on deeper F layers of the forest floor in SA than in ST, where 74 \% of species fruited directly on leaf litter. This observation was consistent with the analysis of radiocarbon content in fruiting bodies, implying that LDM tended to utilize older carbon accumulated at deeper layers of the forest floor in cooler climates. Seasonal changes in the fruiting frequency over a growing season exhibited similar two-peak patterns for all the study sites, coinciding with the periods of rainfall and increasing and decreasing air temperatures in early summer and autumn, respectively, but the fruiting period extended longer in a warmer than in a cooler climate.

AB  - Globally, root production accounts for 33-67\% of terrestrial net primary productivity and influences decomposition via root production and turnover, carbon (C) allocation to mycorrhizal fungi and root exudation. As recognized above ground, the timing of phenological events affects terrestrial C balance, yet there is no parallel understanding for below-ground phenology. In this paper we examine the phenology of root production and its relationship to temperature, soil moisture, and above-ground phenology. Synthesizing 87 observations of whole-plant phenology from 40 studies, we found that, on average, root growth occurs 25 +/- 8d after shoot growth but that the offset between the peak in root and shoot growth varies >200d across biomes (boreal, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical). Root and shoot growth are positively correlated with median monthly temperature and mean monthly precipitation in boreal, temperate, and subtropical biomes. However, a temperature hysteresis in these biomes leads to the hypothesis that internal controls over C allocation to roots are an equally, if not more, important driver of phenology. The specific mechanisms are as yet unclear but they are likely mediated by some combination of photoassimilate supply, hormonal signaling, and growth form.

AB  - This study investigated the possible effects of tree species diversity and identity on the soil microbial community in a species-rich temperate broad-leaved forest. For the first time, we separated the effects of tree identity and tree species diversity on the link between above and belowground communities in a near-natural forest. We established 100 tree clusters consisting of each three tree individuals represented by beech (Fagus sylvatica L), ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L), maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), or lime (Tilia spec.) at two different sites in the Hainich National Park (Thuringia, Germany). The tree clusters included one, two or three species forming a diversity gradient. We investigated the microbial community structure, using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles, in mineral soil samples (0-10 cm) collected in the centre of each cluster. The lowest total PLFA amounts were found in the pure beech clusters (79.0 +/- 23.5 nmol g(-1) soil dw), the highest PLFA amounts existed in the pure ash clusters (287.3 +/- 211.3 nmol g(-1) soil dw). Using principle components analyses (PCA) and redundancy analyses (RDA), we found only for the variables `relative proportion of beech trees' and `living lime fine root tips associated with ectomycorrhiza' a significant effect on the PLFA composition. The microbial community structure was mainly determined by abiotic environmental parameters such as soil pH or clay content. The different species richness levels in the clusters did not significantly differ in their total PLFA amounts and their PLFA composition. We observed a tendency that the PLFA profiles of the microbial communities in more tree species-rich clusters were less influenced by individual PLFAs (more homogenous) than those from species-poor clusters. We concluded that tree species identity and site conditions were more important factors determining the soil microbial community structure than tree species diversity per se. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Boreal forest soil contains significant amounts of organic carbon. Soil disturbance, caused for example by site preparation or stump extraction, may increase decomposition and thus lead to higher CO2 emissions, contributing to global warming. The aim of this study was to quantify responses of soil-surface CO2 fluxes (R-s) and litter (needle and root) decomposition rates following various kinds of soil disturbance commonly caused by mechanical site preparation and stump harvest. For this purpose four treatments were applied in a clear-cut site in central Sweden: i) removal of the humus layer and top 2 cm of mineral soil, ii) placement of a humus layer and 2 cm of mineral soil upside down on top of undisturbed soil, forming a double humus layer buried under mineral soil, iii) heavy mixing of the humus layer and mineral soil, and iv) no disturbance (control). Rs measurements were acquired with a portable respiration system during two growing seasons. To assess the treatments' effects on litter decomposition rates, needles or coarse roots (empty set = 6 mm) were incubated in litterbags at positions they would be located after the treatments (buried, or on top of the soil). The results indicate that site preparation-simulating treatments have no effect or may significantly reduce, rather than increase, CO2 emissions during the following two years. They also show that buried litter decomposes more rapidly than litter on the surface, but in other respects the treatments have little effect on litter decomposition rates.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is a limiting nutrient for the productivity of many agroecosystems, and the depletion of global mineral P reserves is of concern for global food security. On the other hand, overfertilization with P and its subsequent export through runoff can cause eutrophication of water bodies and natural terrestrial habitats. An important challenge is therefore to develop productive farming systems in which P availability in soils is increased, while reducing mineral P inputs, outputs, and negative off-site impacts. Increasing the P availability in cropping systems requires several approaches including management of soil properties and P amendments, agroecology of cropping systems, and plant breeding. The objective of the present review is to identify new research perspectives in agronomy and emerging strategies to improve the P availability in cropping systems. For this purpose, we explore the following: (1) the use of renewable waste-derived P resources (including crop residues, excreta, struvite, and biochar) to improve P availability, particularly the impacts of applications of such renewable P sources on the chemical properties of the soil, soil organic matter dynamics, soil microbial and rhizospheric activity, and, ultimately, P availability; (2) the effects of multispecies cropping system on P availability, notably the incorporation of the concepts of positive plantesoil feedback on P availability, previously demonstrated in grassland and forest ecosystems, to multispecies cropping systems; and (3) the identification of genetic traits of plantemicroorganism relations involved in the tolerance of low-P soils to improve plant breeding outcomes. The challenge for sustainable management of P resources for agriculture is now to reengineer agricultural systems at several scales and to define P management strategies in cropping systems by combining the use of renewable P resources and the management of soil properties, multispecies cropping system, and crop cultivars that increase soil P availability.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (EcM)-mediated nitrogen (N) acquisition is one main strategy used by terrestrial plants to facilitate growth. Measurements of natural abundance nitrogen isotope ratios (denoted as N-15 relative to a standard) increasingly serve as integrative proxies for mycorrhiza-mediated N acquisition due to biological fractionation processes that alter N-15:N-14 ratios. Current understanding of these processes is based on studies from high-latitude ecosystems where plant productivity is largely limited by N availability. Much less is known about the cause and utility of ecosystem N-15 patterns in the tropics. Using structural equation models, model selection and isotope mass balance we assessed relationships among co-occurring soil, mycorrhizal plants and fungal N pools measured from 40 high- and 9 low-latitude ecosystems. At low latitudes N-15-enrichment caused ecosystem components to significantly deviate from those in higher latitudes. Collectively, N-15 patterns suggested reduced N-dependency and unique sources of EcM N-15-enrichment under conditions of high N availability typical of the tropics. Understanding the role of mycorrhizae in global N cycles will require reevaluation of high-latitude perspectives on fractionation sources that structure ecosystem N-15 patterns, as well as better integration of EcM function with biogeochemical theories pertaining to climate-nutrient cycling relationships.

AB  - Mediterranean forest ecosystems are characterized by various vascular plant groups with their associated mycorrhizae and free living soil fungi with various ecological functions. Fire plays a major role in Mediterranean ecosystem dynamics and impacts both above- and below-ground community structure and functioning. However, studies on the effects induced by altered disturbance regimes (associated with recent land use and climate extremes) on fire ecology and especially on its below-ground impacts are few. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of different wildfire regimes on soil fungal community structure using two different molecular methods. We investigated the long-term effects of wildfire on soil fungal communities associated with Pinus pinaster forests in central Portugal, by comparing the results of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)-based profiling with those obtained with 454 pyrosequencing. Four forest stands with differing fire history and fire return interval, and vegetation cover (mature forest, early successional stage of pine regeneration, and forest converted to scrubland) were sampled 6 years after the last fire event. The pyrosequencing-based approach indicated ca. eight-fold higher numbers of taxa than DGGE. However, fungal community fingerprinting data obtained for the different study stands with DGGE were congruent with those obtained with pyrosequencing. Both short (7.6 years) and long (24 years) fire return intervals (indicated by the presence of ericaceous shrubs in the understorey) induced a decrease in the abundance ratio between basidiomycetes and ascomycetes and appeared to reduce the frequency of ectomycorrhizal fungal species and saprophytes. Wildfire significantly reduced the frequency of late stage successional taxa (e.g. Atheliaceae and Cantharellales) and known or putative saprophytes belonging to the Clavulinaceae and the Archaeorhizomycetaceae. Conversely, early successional fungal species belonging to the Thelephoraceae were favoured by both fire return intervals, while the abundance of Cortinarius and Hebeloma, which include several Cistus-specific species, increased with short wildfire return intervals. This last finding highlights the relationship between post-fire vegetation composition and cover (vegetation successional stage), and fungal symbionts. We hypothesise that these changes could, in the long term, exhaust the resilience of Mediterranean pine forest vegetation and associated soil fungal communities by preventing pine regeneration.

AB  - Plant biomass degradation in soil is one of the key steps of carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Fungal saprotrophic communities play an essential role in this process by producing hydrolytic enzymes active on the main components of plant organic matter. Open questions in this field regard the diversity of the species involved, the major biochemical pathways implicated and how these are affected by external factors such as litter quality or climate changes. This can be tackled by environmental genomic approaches involving the systematic sequencing of key enzyme-coding gene families using soil-extracted RNA as material. Such an approach necessitates the design and evaluation of gene family-specific PCR primers producing sequence fragments compatible with high-throughput sequencing approaches. In the present study, we developed and evaluated PCR primers for the specific amplification of fungal CAZy Glycoside Hydrolase gene families GH5 (subfamily 5) and GH11 encoding endo-beta-1,4-glucanases and endo beta-1,4-xylanases respectively as well as Basidiomycota class II peroxidases, corresponding to the CAZy Auxiliary Activity family 2 (AA2), active on lignin. These primers were experimentally validated using DNA extracted from a wide range of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota species including 27 with sequenced genomes. Along with the published primers for Glycoside Hydrolase GH7 encoding enzymes active on cellulose, the newly design primers were shown to be compatible with the Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology. Sequences obtained from RNA extracted from beech or spruce forest soils showed a high diversity and were uniformly distributed in gene trees featuring the global diversity of these gene families.

AB  - Soils sequester and release substantial atmospheric carbon, but the contribution of fungal communities to soil carbon balance under rising CO2 is not well understood. Soil properties likely mediate these fungal responses but are rarely explored in CO2 experiments. We studied soil fungal communities in a grassland ecosystem exposed to a preindustrial-to-future CO2 gradient ( 250 to 500 ppm) in a black clay soil and a sandy loam soil. Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing of the rRNA gene cluster revealed that fungal community composition and its response to CO2 differed significantly between soils. Fungal species richness and relative abundance of Chytridiomycota ( chytrids) increased linearly with CO2 in the black clay ( P < 0.04, R-2 > 0.7), whereas the relative abundance of Glomeromycota ( arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) increased linearly with elevated CO2 in the sandy loam ( P = 0.02, R-2 = 0.63). Across both soils, decomposition rate was positively correlated with chytrid relative abundance ( r = 0.57) and, in the black clay soil, fungal species richness. Decomposition rate was more strongly correlated with microbial biomass ( r = 0.88) than with fungal variables. Increased labile carbon availability with elevated CO2 may explain the greater fungal species richness and Chytridiomycota abundance in the black clay soil, whereas increased phosphorus limitation may explain the increase in Glomeromycota at elevated O-2 in the sandy loam. Our results demonstrate that soil type plays a key role in soil fungal responses to rising atmospheric CO2.

AB  - It has been shown that wood substrates are the main source of nitrogen for xylotrophic fungi, which have almost the same isotopic signature as their substrate. This fact and a strong positive correlation in nitrogen isotope composition between the substrates and fungi provide evidence for a closed type of nitrogen turnover in the wood-fungus system that is based on retention and repeated utilization of this element. Its isotope composition in the fungi depends on that in the substrate, which is enriched in the heavy isotope in deciduous wood and in the light isotope in coniferous wood. The nitrogen isotope composition in the fungi and wood substrates does not depend on the degree of wood mineralization or climatic conditions, and delta N-15 is not an indicator of fungal physiological activity or wood decomposition rate but rather a marker of the isotopic composition of nitrogen sources for the fungi.

AB  - To determine the exchange of nitrogen and carbon between ectomycorrhiza and host plant, young beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees from natural regeneration in intact soil cores were labelled for one growing season in a greenhouse with (CO2)-C-13 and (NO3)-N-15 (NH4)-N-15. The specific enrichments of N-15 and C-13 were higher in ectomycorrhizas (EMs) than in any other tissue. The enrichments of C-13 and N-15 were also higher in the fine-root segments directly connected with the EM (mainly second-order roots) than that in bulk fine or coarse roots. A strict, positive correlation was found between the specific N-15 enrichment in EM and the attached second-order roots. This finding indicates that strong N accumulators provide more N to their host than low N accumulators. A significant correlation was also found for the specific C-13 enrichment in EM and the attached second-order roots. However, the specific enrichments for N-15 and C-13 in EM were unrelated showing that under long-term conditions, C and N exchange between host and EMs are uncoupled. These findings suggest that EM-mediated N flux to the plant is not the main control on carbon flux to the fungus, probably because EMs provide many different services to their hosts in addition to N provision in their natural assemblages.

AB  - In the highlands of Western Kenya, intensified land use combined with low use of mineral fertilizers at farm level is driving soil nutrient depletion and declining yield levels. All farms and individual field crop plots are surrounded by life fences and the area under such hedge structure is estimated to cover 3-5\% of the total farmland area. The land below the hedges is not tilled and may receive nutrient and carbon inputs by the occasional addition of field crop residues and litter fall. We hypothesized that the areas covered by live fences represent not only an important land resource, but are also largely untapped sites characterized by high soil fertility in an otherwise largely degraded environment. We characterized physico-chemical attributes of top soils collected on farmland and from adjacent live fences composed of five different fencing species in representative environments of Kakamega district (sandy Acrisol and bimodal rainfall distribution vs. clay Ferralsol and monomodal rainfall distribution). In addition, the maize production potential of these soils was assessed in a supplementary pot experiment. Concentrations and total amounts of soil C, N, N supplying capacity, exchangeable K, as well as aggregate stability tended to be higher in hedge structures than in field crop soil. The amount of labile (permanganate- oxidizable) carbon and the carbon management index in fence lines on Acrisol were similar to those of the adjacent Kakamega rain forest reserve, while they were reduced by >50\% in crop fields. These trends were reflected in the biomass and Nand K uptake by maize in potted soil. Effects were generally larger in Acrisol than in Ferralsol and were most pronounced with Tithonia diversifolia. We conclude that live fences are soil fertility hotspots that may be valorised in the future by replacing the generally unproductive fencing species with economical perennial crops.

AB  - The scientific basis for restoration of fire-excluded western larch/mixed-conifer forests is not as well developed as that for dry fire-frequent forests. We compared the effects of wildfire and restoration (combined thinning and prescribed fire) in fire-excluded western larch forests. In 2012, the wildfire site had more, taller, and more diverse tree regeneration; greater volume of coarse woody debris (CWD); and greater spatial heterogeneity (including more area in large openings) than the restoration site. Management recommendations based on our results include the following: use more intense prescribed fire than was applied to the restoration site we studied; retain abundant CWD on-site after restoration treatment; and create occasional large openings to regenerate larch and emulate the spatial heterogeneity induced by natural wildfire. Our most important finding is the greater dynamism of the wildfire-affected site than of the restored site. At the wildfire site, tree populations are turning over faster, regenerating trees are growing faster, and more CWD is available for decomposition. These contrasting outcomes suggest that a conceptualization of forest restoration that emphasizes static, or at least equilibrium, conditions is not appropriate for western larch/mixed-conifer forests.

AB  - Knowledge about the distribution pattern and function of soil microbial communities is essential for understanding their vital role in ecosystem functioning. However, little is known about the elevational patterns of microbial communities at high altitudes on the Tibetan Plateau, a region that is very sensitive to global change. We investigated the microbial community composition and functional patterns along an elevational gradient (3100-4600 m above sea level) on Mount Segrila using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and community level physiological profiles (CLPP). Soil microbes were abundant even at higher altitudes and ranged from 1.52 to 3.53 mu mol per g organic carbon (OC) by total PLFAs. Soil microbial biomass (expressed as Total PLFAs) declined at higher elevations, and the highest abundance was observed at the low-elevation site. Fungal to bacterial ratio decreased with increasing elevation. While no consistent elevational pattern was observed for PLFA profiles, richness and diversity of carbon source utilization by the microbial community decreased significantly at higher altitudes. Soil microbes at higher altitudes had the potential to metabolize relatively more recalcitrant carbon components while microbes at lower altitudes tended to utilize labile carbon sources. The results were in line with the chemical composition of soil organic matter. Increasing O-alkyl C and decreasing alkyl C content indicate slow decomposition at higher elevations. Variations in structure and activity of microbial community were mainly attributable to MAT, pH, and litter C:N. Our results indicate that pH is a major factor affecting microbial communities, and the impact of soil pH is closely correlated with temperature and vegetation changes along the elevational gradient. As future climate warming may lead to temperature increases and an upward migration of vegetation, our results provide fundamental knowledge of soil microbial communities in the Tibetan alpine region and may help to predict responses of the below-ground community to global climate change.

AB  - Partially decomposed plant and animal remains have been accumulating in organic soils (i.e. >40\% C content) for millennia, making them the largest terrestrial carbon store. There is growing concern that, in a warming world, soil biotic processing will accelerate and release greenhouse gases that further exacerbate climate change. However, the magnitude of this response remains uncertain as the constraints are abiotic, biotic and interactive. Here, we examined the influence of resource quality and biological activity on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration under different soil moisture regimes. Organic soils were sampled from 13 boreal and peatland ecosystems located in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Finland and Sweden, representing a natural resource quality range of C, N and P. They were incubated at four temperatures (4, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C) at either 60\% or 100\% water holding capacity (WHC). Our results showed that chemical and biological properties play an important role in determining soil respiration responses to temperature and moisture changes. High soil C : P and C : N ratios were symptomatic of slow C turnover and long-term C accumulation. In boreal soils, low bacterial to fungal ratios were related to greater temperature sensitivity of respiration, which was amplified in drier conditions. This contrasted with peatland soils which were dominated by bacterial communities and enchytraeid grazing, resulting in a more rapid C turnover under warmer and wetter conditions. The unexpected acceleration of C mineralization under high moisture contents was possibly linked to the primarily role of fermented organic matter, instead of oxygen, in mediating microbial decomposition. We conclude that to improve C model simulations of soil respiration, a better resolution of the interactions occurring between climate, resource quality and the decomposer community will be required.

AB  - We studied the influence of plant functional groups on soil microbial community composition and nutrient cycling in a tropical Eucalyptus forest ecosystem with different plantation age and soil types by means of stem girdling (SG) and understory removal (UR). Fungal and bacterial communities were characterized using phospholipid fatty acids, and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) colonisation was estimated visually. Total bacterial and saprotrophic fungal biomass was highest in soils treated with SG, followed by UR, through modification of plant belowground C allocation and N supply. EMF root colonisation, biomass of EMF, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and the fungal-to-bacterial ratio were lowest in these soils. We found that EMF, AMF and the fungal-to-bacterial ratio were highest in sandy loam soils with a high C/N ratio and low pH. The fungal-to-bacterial ratio was higher in 5-year-old than in 15-year-old plantation. We propose that girdling of trees and removal of understory plants are important ecological components, due to their modification of plant belowground C allocation and N supply as key determinants of microbial community composition. Our results highlight the fact that soil abiotic factors play an important role in shaping the microbial community and nutrient cycling in tropical forest ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Precipitation as a key determinant of forest productivity influences forest ecosystems also indirectly through alteration of the nutrient status of the soil, but this interaction is not well understood. Along a steep precipitation gradient, we studied the consequences of reduced precipitation for the soil and biomass nutrient pools and dynamics in 14 mature European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests on Triassic sandstone. We tested the hypotheses that lowered summer precipitation (1) is associated with less acid soils and (2) a reduced accumulation of organic matter on the forest floor, and (3) reduces nutrient supply from the soil and leads to decreasing foliar and root nutrient concentrations. Soil acidity, the amount of forest floor organic matter, and the associated organic matter N and P pools decreased to about a half from wet to dry sites; the C/P and N/P ratios, but not the C/N ratio, of forest floor organic matter were reduced as well. Net N mineralization and P and K pools in the mineral soil did not change with decreasing precipitation. Foliar P and K concentrations (beech sun leaves) increased while N remained constant, resulting in decreasing foliar N/P and N/K ratios. Estimated N resorption efficiency increased toward the dry sites. We conclude that a reduction in summer rainfall significantly reduces the soil C, N and P pools but does not result in decreasing foliar N and P contents in beech. However, the decreasing foliar N/P ratios towards the dry stands indicate that the importance of P limitation for tree growth declines with decreasing precipitation.

AB  - Decades of studies on the role of decomposition in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling have focused on organic matter (OM) of plant origin. Despite potentially large inputs of belowground OM from fungal cell walls and invertebrate exoskeletons, studies of the decomposability of their major constituent, chitin, are scarce. To explore effects on soil C dynamics of chitin, in comparison with two plant-derived chemicals, cellulose and lignin, I conducted a field-based chemical-addition experiment. The design contained three chemical treatments plus a control, with four replicates in each of two species of tropical trees grown in plantations. The chemicals were added in reagent-grade form at a rate that doubled the natural detrital C inputs of 1000 g C m(-2) y(-1). Despite its purported recalcitrance, chitin was metabolized quickly, with soil respiration (R (soil)) increasing by 64\% above the control within days, coupled with a 32\% increase in soil extractable ammonium. Cellulose, which was expected to be labile, was not readily decomposed, whereas lignin was rapidly metabolized at least partially in one of the forest types. I examined effects of stoichiometry by adding to all treatments ammonium nitrate in a quantity that adjusted the C:N of cellulose (166) to that of chitin (10), using both field and in vitro experiments. For cellulose, CO2 release increased more than five- to eightfold after N addition in root-free soil incubated in vitro, but only 0-20\% in situ where roots were intact. By the end of the 2-year-long field experiment, fine-root biomass tended to be higher in the chitin treatment, where R (soil) was significantly higher. Together these findings suggest that soil N availability limited cellulose decomposition, even in this Neotropical forest with high soil N stocks, and also that trees successfully competed for N that became available as chitin decomposed. These results indicate that the major constituent of cell walls of soil fungi, chitin, can decompose rapidly and release substantial N that is available for plant and microbial growth. As a consequence, soil fungi can stimulate soil OM decomposition and N cycling, and thereby play a disproportionate role in ecosystem C and N dynamics.

AB  - To find out how N-saturated forests can return to an N-limited state, we examined the recovery of biotic N sinks under decreasing N supply. . We studied a 40-year-old experiment in Pinus sylvestris forest, with control plots, N0, three N treatments, N1-N3, of which N3 was stopped after 20 years, allowing observation of recovery. In N3, the N concentration in foliage was still slightly elevated, but the N uptake capacity of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots in N3 was no longer lower than in N0. Per area the amount of a biomarker for fungi, here mainly attributed ECM, was higher in N3 and N0 than in N1 and N2. Retention of labeled (NH4)-N-15 (+) by the soil was greater in the control (99 \%) and N3 (86 \%), than in N1 (45 \%) and N2 (29 \%); we ascribe these differences to biotic retention because cation exchange capacity did not vary. Gross N mineralisation and retention of N correlated, negatively and positively, respectively, with abundance of ECM fungal biomarker. . The results suggest a key role for ECM fungi in regulating the N cycle. We propose, in accordance with plant C allocation theory, that recovery is driven by increased tree below-ground C allocation to ECM roots and fungi.

AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is grown on over 8 million ha in Brazil and is used to produce ethanol and sugar. Some sugarcane fields are burned to facilitate harvesting, which can affect the soil microbial community. However, whether sugarcane pre-harvest burning affects the community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and symbioses development is not known. In this study, we investigated the early impacts of harvest management on AMF spore communities and root colonization in three sugarcane varieties, under two harvest management systems (no-burning and pre-harvest burning). Soil and root samples were collected in the field after the first harvest of sugarcane varieties SP813250, SP801842, and RB72454, and AMF species were identified based on spore morphology. Diversity indices were determined based on spore populations and root colonization determined as an indicator of symbioses development. Based on the diversity indices, spore number and species occurrence in soil, no significant differences were observed among the AMF communities, regardless of harvest management type, sugarcane variety or interactions between harvest management type and sugarcane variety. However, mycorrhiza development was stimulated in sugarcane under the no-burning management system. Our data suggest that the sugarcane harvest management system may cause early changes in arbuscular mycorrhiza development.

AB  - Temperature and nutrients are major limiting factors in subarctic tundra. Experimental manipulation of nutrient availability along elevational gradients (and thus temperature) can improve our understanding of ecological responses to climate change. However, no study to date has explored impacts of nutrient addition along a tundra elevational gradient, or across contrasting vegetation types along any elevational gradient. We set up a full factorial nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization experiment in each of two vegetation types (heath and meadow) at 500 m, 800 m, and 1000 m elevation in northern Swedish tundra. We predicted that plant and microbial communities in heath or at lower elevations would be more responsive to N addition while communities in meadow or at higher elevations would be more responsive to P addition, and that fertilizer effects would vary more with elevation for the heath than for the meadow. Although our results provided little support for these predictions, the relationship between nutrient limitation and elevation differed between vegetation types. Most plant and microbial properties were responsive to N and/or P fertilization, but responses often varied with elevation and/or vegetation type. For instance, vegetation density significantly increased with N + P fertilization relative to the other fertilizer treatments, and this increase was greatest at the lowest elevation for the heath but at the highest elevation for the meadow. Arbuscular mycorrhizae decreased with P fertilization at 500 m for the meadow, but with all fertilizer treatments in both vegetation types at 800 m. Fungal to bacterial ratios were enhanced by N + P fertilization for the two highest elevations in the meadow only. Additionally, microbial responses to fertilization were primarily direct rather than indirect via plant responses, pointing to a decoupled response of plant and microbial communities to nutrient addition and elevation. Because our study shows how two community types differ in their responses to fertilization and elevation, and because the temperature range across this gradient is similar to 3 degrees C, our study is informative about how nutrient limitation in tundra may be influenced by temperature shifts that are comparable to those expected under climate change during this century.

AB  - RATIONALE Stable isotope analysis (SIA) is used widely for reconstructing trophic links of vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Soil macrofauna form a substantial food source for a range of predators including amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. SIA-based estimations of their trophic niches require knowledge on the full range of isotopic signatures of potential preys. Considering the extremely high diversity of soil animals, this information is not easy to obtain. METHODS We estimated a typical range of the isotopic signatures of soil macrofauna by compiling published and original data on soil macroinvertebrates in 11 temperate forests. We examined whether the baseline correction (i.e. subtracting 13C or 15N values of local litter) would decrease the between-site variability in the 13C and 15N values of soil animals. The dataset was subsequently used to estimate the frequency distribution of 13C and 15N values in saprophagous and predatory soil animals. RESULTS The baseline correction reduced the between-site variability in 15N, but not in 13C values of soil animals. Over 95\% of the taxa or individuals examined fell into an isotopic space with uncorrected 13C values ranging from -27.9 to -22.5 parts per thousand, and litter-normalized 15N values from 0.8 to 9.6 parts per thousand. Saprophagous and predatory soil animals were on average enriched in 13C relative to plant litter by 3.5 and 2.7 parts per thousand, respectively, which is likely to reflect the importance of saprotrophic microorganisms as the main energy source in soil food webs. The difference in 15N values between saprophages and predators averaged 2.8 parts per thousand, which fits the anticipated trophic enrichment per trophic level. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that the range of possible 15N values of soil macrofauna in temperate forest ecosystems can roughly be predicted based on the 15N values of plant litter. On the other hand, no site-specific normalization is usually required when predicting the range of 13C values of soil macroinvertebrates. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Microbial communities in soil mediate biogeochemical processes; however, understanding forces shaping their composition and function remains a gap in our ecological knowledge. We investigated phylogenetic turnover and functional gene composition of saprotrophic fungi along a 4000-year glacial chronosequence. A direct relationship between -diversity and geographic distance, a proxy for time since deglaciation, indicated that dispersal limitation shapes saprotrophic fungal communities. Further, we infer that dispersal limitation may also influence fungal functional properties as metabolic potential and functional richness increased with site age. Despite attempts to minimize environmental variation, a direct relationship between -diversity and biogeochemical differences across sites indicated that environmental filtering further shapes fungal community composition. However, environmental filtering was overshadowed by the effect of dispersal limitation when tested by multiple regression. Fungal -diversity and composition of functional genes involved in plant litter decay were unrelated, suggesting that functional traits are not phylogenetically conserved across this chronosequence. Our study suggests that dispersal limitation operates in structuring present-day fungal community composition and functional potential. Further, we demonstrate the need to integrate functional and phylogenetic approaches to more accurately portray microbial communities and their functional capacities.

AB  - Understanding climate effects on plant-soil interactions in terrestrial ecosystems remains challenging due to the fact that floristic composition covaries with climate, particularly along rainfall gradients. It is difficult to separate effects of precipitation per se from those mediated indirectly through changes in species composition. As such, afforestation (the intentional planting of woody species) in terrestrial ecosystems provides an ecological opportunity to assess the relative importance of climate and vegetation controls on ecosystem processes. We investigated the impacts of 35years of afforestation on ecosystem N dynamics, in ecosystems ranging from arid shrub-steppe to closed-canopy forest in Patagonia, Argentina. Sites of natural vegetation and adjacent sites planted with a single exotic species, Pinus ponderosa, were identified in five precipitation regimes along a continuous gradient of 250-2200mm mean annual precipitation (MAP). We evaluated C and N parameters of vegetation and soil, as well as natural abundance of C-13 and N-15 in leaves, roots, ectomycorrhizae (EcM) and soils. In natural vegetation, most leaf traits (\%N, C:N ratios, leaf mass per area, delta N-15 values) demonstrated strong significant relationships with MAP, while these relationships were nearly absent in afforested sites. In addition, the EcM of native southern beech and pine trees were significantly enriched in N-15 relative to leaves at all sites where they were present. While soil C and N pools in both vegetation types increased with MAP, overall pool sizes were significantly reduced in afforested sites. Synthesis. Observed relationships between leaf traits and precipitation in natural vegetation may be driven largely by shifts in species composition and plant-soil interactions, rather than direct effects of precipitation. Our results suggest that a change in the species composition of the dominant vegetation is sufficient to alter C and N cycling independently of climate constraints: pine afforestation homogenized N dynamics across sites spanning an order of magnitude of MAP. These results highlight the important control of ectomycorrhizal associations in affecting C and N dynamics. Additionally, they serve to demonstrate that altering natural species composition alone is sufficient to cause large, detectable impacts on N turnover independently of direct climate effects.

AB  - Invasive plant species can interact with native soil microbes in ways that change how they use nutrients and allocate biomass. To examine whether Microstegium vimineum form symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and whether AMF mediate nutrient acquisition and growth of the plant, we conducted a field survey in Raleigh, NC and Hangzhou, China and two experiments in growth chambers. This is the first report that M. vimineum is mycorrhizal, with colonization rates of 47 and 21 \% in its native and invaded range, respectively. In the growth chamber, addition of an AMF inoculum mixture significantly promoted M. vimineum biomass accumulation in both field and sterilized soils, particularly after 64 days of growth. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi also increased plant phosphorous (P) uptake but did not consistently affect total plant nitrogen (N) acquisition, leading to decreases in plant N:P ratios. More interestingly, AMF significantly altered plant morphology, increasing the number of stolons and aerial roots per individual (59 and 723 \%), aerial roots per gram aboveground biomass (374 \%) and aerial roots per stolon (404 \%). Our results suggest that mycorrhizal enhancement of plant growth by stimulating tillering may serve as another mechanism by which M. vimineum can quickly take over new territory. Future studies on invasive plant-microbial interactions are needed to understand the mechanisms through which microbes contribute to the competitive ability of invasive plants.

AB  - Identifying the ecological processes that structure communities and the consequences for ecosystem function is a central goal of ecology. The recognition that fungi, bacteria, and viruses control key ecosystem functions has made microbial communities a major focus of this field. Because many ecological processes are apparent only at particular spatial or temporal scales, a complete understanding of the linkages between microbial community, environment, and function requires analysis across a wide range of scales. Here, we map the biological and functional geography of soil fungi from local to continental scales and show that the principal ecological processes controlling community structure and function operate at different scales. Similar to plants or animals, most soil fungi are endemic to particular bioregions, suggesting that factors operating at large spatial scales, like dispersal limitation or climate, are the first-order determinants of fungal community structure in nature. By contrast, soil extracellular enzyme activity is highly convergent across bioregions and widely differing fungal communities. Instead, soil enzyme activity is correlated with local soil environment and distribution of fungal traits within the community. The lack of structure-function relationships for soil fungal communities at continental scales indicates a high degree of functional redundancy among fungal communities in global biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi are ubiquitous in grass roots, but their colonizations may vary according to latitudinal gradient and site conditions. We investigated how vegetation zone (boreal vs. subarctic), humus thickness, and site openness affect root fungal colonizations of the grass Avenella flexuosa. More precisely, we hypothesized that AM and DSE fungal colonizations would have different responses to environmental conditions such that AM fungi could be more common in boreal zone, whereas we expected DSE fungi to be more affected by the amount of humus. We found site openness to affect AM and DSE fungi in a contrasting manner, in interaction with the vegetation zone. AM colonization was high at open coastal dunes, whereas DSE fungi were more common at forested sites, in the boreal zone. Humus thickness affected AM fungi negatively and DSE fungi positively. To conclude, the observed AM and DSE fungal colonization patterns were largely contrasting. AM fungi were favored in seashore conditions characterized by thin humus layer, whereas DSE fungi were favored in conditions of higher humus availability.

AB  - We attempted to introduce ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi onto seedlings of Dipterocarpus alatus (Dipterocarpaceae) by soil inocula collected from tree stands of D. alatus. Top soils collected from beneath the trees of D. alatus in a dry evergreen forest and a 15-year-old plantation were inoculated onto germinating seeds of D. alatus. After 7 months of seedling cultivation, ECM fungal communities in the seedlings were investigated based on the sequences of ITS rDNA. The ECM fungi detected were divided into 19 phylotypes by molecular analysis. Most of the phylotypes were identified as ECM fungal taxa, i.e., Clavulina, Laccaria, Lactarius, Tomentella, Pyronemataceae, and Tricholomataceae. Accordingly, we can confirm that soil inoculation is a simple method to induce ECM formation with diverse fungi in pot cultured seedlings, which would be useful for introducing diverse ECM fungi to dipterocarp plantations.

AB  - Cryoturbation, the burial of topsoil material into deeper soil horizons by repeated freeze-thaw events, is an important storage mechanism for soil organic matter (SOM) in permafrost-affected soils. Besides abiotic conditions, microbial community structure and the accessibility of SOM to the decomposer community are hypothesized to control SOM decomposition and thus have a crucial role in SOM accumulation in buried soils. We surveyed the microbial community structure in cryoturbated soils from nine soil profiles in the northeastern Siberian tundra using high-throughput sequencing and quantification of bacterial, archaeal and fungal marker genes. We found that bacterial abundances in buried topsoils were as high as in unburied topsoils. In contrast, fungal abundances decreased with depth and were significantly lower in buried than in unburied topsoils resulting in remarkably low fungal to bacterial ratios in buried topsoils. Fungal community profiling revealed an associated decrease in presumably ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. The abiotic conditions (low to subzero temperatures, anoxia) and the reduced abundance of fungi likely provide a niche for bacterial, facultative anaerobic decomposers of SOM such as members of the Actinobacteria, which were found in significantly higher relative abundances in buried than in unburied topsoils. Our study expands the knowledge on the microbial community structure in soils of Northern latitude permafrost regions, and attributes the delayed decomposition of SOM in buried soils to specific microbial taxa, and particularly to a decrease in abundance and activity of ECM fungi, and to the extent to which bacterial decomposers are able to act as their functional substitutes.

The fungal assemblages identified in each substratum showed an overlap value ranging from 5.9\% to 46.7\%. A consistent connection between certain fungal species and their substrata was detected; among the 168 fungal species identified, 104 (62\%) may be regarded as specialised. Each fungal species was characterised according to morphological and ecological features. Multidimensional scaling showed that ubiquitous and common species have morphological characters distinguishing them from specialised species.

AB  - The conversion of agriculture land to short rotation coppice (SRC) systems with hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) is becoming an important practice to store carbon and produce biomass for the fiber industry. This land-use change is likely to affect the microbial community structure, in part through the introduction of an ectomycorrhizal host, but also by changing organic matter inputs, ultimately shifting the molecular composition of soil organic matter (SOM) because these properties are crop-specific. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of different aged poplar stands growing on Orthic Gray Luvisols on these soil properties compared to an adjacent perennial crop. The site consisted of four treatments: hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x Populus petroskyana) in SRC of 7 and 14 years age (Pop7 and Pop14), a 40-year-old aspen (Populus tremuloides) forest (Aspen), and an adjacent arable site with alfalfa (Medicago sativa). The molecular composition of SOM was determined using pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS) and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy at the nitrogen (N) K-edge (N-XANES). Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles revealed higher concentrations of fungal but not bacterial biomarkers in poplar plantations than under alfalfa. Fungal:bacterial ratio was lower under alfalfa than under poplar trees. Overall microbial community structure also changed in response to vegetation type and the duration of woody biomass. Along the chronosequence of poplar, Py-FIMS revealed significant increases in the proportions of carbohydrates with pentose and hexose subunits, phenols and lignin monomers, alkylaromatics and peptides and significant decreases in lipids, alkanes, alkenes, bound fatty acids and alkylmonoesters and free fatty acids with increasing poplar stand age. Thermal stability of sterols decreased along the chronosequence, suggesting that poplar plantations are not involved in the build-up of these substances. Differences in the ordination were well reflected by N K-edge XANES spectra. Increased carbohydrate portions indicated a significant impact of the ectomycorrhizal host poplar on the molecular composition of SOM in arable soils. Our results demonstrate that a change in land-use from agricultural cropping to woody biomass caused shifts in microbial community structure that were lagged by a shift in SOM chemistry. These shifts impact soil functioning and should be considered in future land management strategies when SRC are harvested. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Terrestrial microbial decomposer communities thrive on a wide range of organic matter types that rarely ever meet their elemental demands. In this review we synthesize the current state-of-the-art of microbial adaptations to resource stoichiometry, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the interactions between heterotrophic microbial communities and their chemical environment. The stoichiometric imbalance between microbial communities and their organic substrates generally decreases from wood to leaf litter and further to topsoil and subsoil organic matter. Microbial communities can respond to these imbalances in four ways: first, they adapt their biomass composition toward their resource in a non-homeostatic behavior. Such changes are, however, only moderate, and occur mainly because of changes in microbial community structure and less so due to cellular storage of elements in excess. Second, microbial communities can mobilize resources that meet their elemental demand by producing specific extracellular enzymes, which, in turn, is restricted by the C and N requirement for enzyme production itself. Third, microbes can regulate their element use efficiencies (ratio of element invested in growth over total element uptake), such that they release elements in excess depending on their demand (e.g., respiration and N mineralization). Fourth, diazotrophic bacteria and saprotrophic fungi may trigger the input of external N and P to decomposer communities. Theoretical considerations show that adjustments in element use efficiencies may be the most important mechanism by which microbes regulate their biomass stoichiometry. This review summarizes different views on how microbes cope with imbalanced supply of C, N and P thereby providing a framework for integrating and linking microbial adaptation to resource imbalances to ecosystem scale fluxes across scales and ecosystems.

AB  - Ecosystems change between arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal vegetation dominance over anthropological and geological time scales, yet consequences for ecosystem function are unclear. We review four hypotheses for the effect of mycorrhizal status on ecosystem function. Specifically, that differences between ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal dominated ecosystems are driven by (1) foliar trait differences, (2) positive plant-soil feedback in ectomycorrhizal plants, (3) differences in the ability to dissolve rocks as a source of nutrition, and (4) differences in the ability to use organic nutrients. We find no universal difference in foliar traits with mycorrhizal status. A spatial simulation suggests that positive plant-soil feedback in ectomycorrhizal plants is unlikely to drive ecosystem differences. However, negative feedback appears to be more common in arbuscular mycorrhizal trees than ectomycorrhizal trees and may represent an important ecosystem difference. Rock dissolution occurs under both mycorrhizal types but may differ in rate. Hypothesis 4 was the best supported: a model and some field evidence suggest that decoupling of carbon and nutrients in ectomycorrhizal decomposition leads to inhibition of saprotrophic mineralization, with context-dependent effects. Greater understanding of organic nutrient utilization differences may be key to improving incorporation of mycorrhizas in ecosystem ecology.

AB  - In High Arctic ecosystems, plant growth and reproduction are limited by low soil moisture and nutrient availability, low soil and air temperatures, and a short growing season. Mycorrhizal associations facilitate plant nutrient acquisition and water uptake and may therefore be particularly ecologically important in nutrition-poor and dry environments, such as parts of the Arctic. Similarly, endophytic root associates are thought to play a protective role, increasing plants' stress tolerance, and likely have an important ecosystem function. Despite the importance of these root-associated fungi, little is known about their host specificity in the Arctic. We investigated the host specificity of root-associated fungi in the common, widely distributed arctic plant species Bistorta vivipara, Salix polaris and Dryas octopetala in the High Arctic archipelago Svalbard. High-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplified from whole root systems generated no evidence of host specificity and no spatial autocorrelation within two 3mx3m sample plots. The lack of spatial structure at small spatial scales indicates that Common Mycelial Networks (CMNs) are rare in marginal arctic environments. Moreover, no significant differences in fungal OTU richness were observed across the three plant species, although their root system characteristics (size, biomass) differed considerably. Reasons for lack of host specificity could be that association with generalist fungi may allow arctic plants to more rapidly and easily colonize newly available habitats, and it may be favourable to establish symbiotic relationships with fungi possessing different physiological attributes.

Our study evaluated soil amino acids, NH4+, and NO3- pools, soil properties, and enzyme activities under three types of plant-mycorrhizal associations along a cold-temperate forest elevation gradient. We found that amino acid concentrations increased as elevation increased (0.21 mg kg(-1) per 100 m), while NH4+ and NO3- pool sizes remained constant (0.9-3 mg kg(-1) for NH4+-N and 0-0.5 mg kg(-1) for NO3--N). Similar pool sizes and composition of soil soluble N were found under three plant-mycorrhizal associations. We concluded that amino acids, as a major component of soil N, increasingly supplement inorganic N as elevation increases. This study provides evidence of the importance of amino acids in soil soluble N of northern Idaho cold-temperate forest ecosystems, especially at high elevations, suggesting the need to include organic amino acids in future studies of forest nutrient availability.

AB  - The distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal structures in roots, in soil surrounding roots and in amended coffee pulps (CP) was investigated in 12 coffee plantations in Colombia. Fresh CP had been added to plants 6-10 months before sampling. The questions were whether soil chemical and physical parameter and soil depth had an effect on mycorrhiza. Root colonization rates with AM increased in CP amended-plants (F = 7.75, P<0.001) as compared to a non-amended control. Significantly more roots, CP and AM root colonization were found in the upper soil layer (F = 41.24, 9.54, 6.60 respectively, P<0.001), while root external mycelium and CP colonization with AM were not affected by soil depth (F = 14.82, P>0.05). External mycelium length differed between locations (F = 5.89, P<0.001) and was inversely correlated with soil water content (r = -0.655, P = 0.02). External mycelium length per AM colonized root was higher in the lower soil layer (F = 14.82, P<0.05). Soil aeration seemed to be an important physical characteristic for mycorrhiza development in and around coffee roots. Higher mycorrhiza colonization in CP amended-plants might be an adaptive strategy for nutrients acquisition, and AM external mycelium that colonizes CP might take up nutrients directly during CP decomposition.

AB  - In forest ecosystems, plant communities shape soil fungal communities through the provisioning of carbon. Although the variation in forest composition with latitude is well established, little is known about how soil fungal communities vary with latitude. We collected soil samples from 17 forests, along a latitudinal transect in western China. Forest types covered included boreal, temperate, subtropical and tropical forests. We used 454 pyrosequencing techniques to analyze the soil communities. These data were correlated with abiotic and biotic variables to determine which factors most strongly influenced fungal community composition. Our results indicated that temperature, latitude, and plant diversity most strongly influence soil fungal community composition. Fungal diversity patterns were unimodal, with temperate forests (mid latitude) exhibiting the greatest diversity. Furthermore, these diversity patterns indicate that fungal diversity was highest in the forest systems with the lowest tree diversity (temperate forests). Different forest systems were dominated by different fungal subgroups, ectomycorrhizal fungi dominated in boreal and temperate forests; endomycorrhizal fungi dominated in the tropical rainforests, and non-mycorrhizal fungi were best represented in subtropical forests. Our results suggest that soil fungal communities are strongly dependent on vegetation type, with fungal diversity displaying an inverse relationship to plant diversity.

AB  - We studied the role of taxonomical and functional ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal diversity in root formation and nutrient uptake by Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings with fast- and slow-growing phenotypes. Seedlings were grown with an increasing ECM fungal diversity gradient from one to four species and sampled before aboveground growth differences between the two phenotypes were apparent. ECM fungal colonization patterns were determined and functional diversity was assayed via measurements of potential enzyme activities of eight exoenzymes probably involved in nutrient mobilization. Phenotypes did not vary in their receptiveness to different ECM fungal species. However, seedlings of slow-growing phenotypes had higher fine-root density and thus more condensed root systems than fast-growing seedlings, but the potential enzyme activities of ectomycorrhizas did not differ qualitatively or quantitatively. ECM species richness increased host nutrient acquisition potential by diversifying the exoenzyme palette. Needle nitrogen content correlated positively with high chitinase activity of ectomycorrhizas. Rather than fast- and slow-growing phenotypes exhibiting differing receptiveness to ECM fungi, our results suggest that distinctions in fine-root structuring and in the belowground growth strategy already apparent at early stages of seedling development may explain later growth differences between fast- and slow-growing families.

AB  - Soil extracellular enzymes are the proximal drivers of decomposition. However, the relative influence of climate, soil nutrients and edaphic factors compared to microbial community composition on extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) is poorly resolved. Determining the relative effects of these factors on soil EEA is critical since changes in climate and microbial species composition may have large impacts on decomposition. We measured EEA from five sites during the growing season in March and 17 sites during the dry season in July throughout southern California and simultaneously collected data on climate, soil nutrients, soil edaphic factors and fungal community composition. The concentration of carbon and nitrogen in the soil and soil pH were most related to hydrolytic EEA. Conversely, oxidative EEA was mostly related to mean annual precipitation. Fungal community composition was not correlated with EEA at the species, genus, family or order levels. The hyphal length of fungi was correlated with EEA during the growing season while relative abundance of taxa within fungal phyla, in particular Chytridiomycota, was correlated with the EEA of beta-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, acid phosphatase and beta-xylosidase in the dry season. Overall, in the dry season, 35.3 \% of the variation in all enzyme activities was accounted for by abiotic variables, while fungal composition accounted for 27.4 \%. Because global change is expected to alter precipitation regimes and increase nitrogen deposition in soils, EEA may be affected, with consequences for decomposition.

AB  - In old and heavily weathered soils, the availability of P might be so small that the primary production of plants is limited. However, plants have evolved several mechanisms to actively take up P from the soil or mine it to overcome this limitation. These mechanisms involve the active uptake of P mediated by mycorrhiza, biotic de-occlusion through root clusters, and the biotic enhancement of weathering through root exudation. The objective of this paper is to investigate how and where these processes contribute to alleviate P limitation on primary productivity. To do so, we propose a process-based model accounting for the major processes of the carbon, water, and P cycles including chemical weathering at the global scale. Implementing P limitation on biomass synthesis allows the assessment of the efficiencies of biomass production across different ecosystems. We use simulation experiments to assess the relative importance of the different uptake mechanisms to alleviate P limitation on biomass production. We find that active P uptake is an essential mechanism for sustaining P availability on long timescales, whereas biotic de-occlusion might serve as a buffer on timescales shorter than 10 000 yr. Although active P uptake is essential for reducing P losses by leaching, humid lowland soils reach P limitation after around 100 000 yr of soil evolution. Given the generalized modelling framework, our model results compare reasonably with observed or independently estimated patterns and ranges of P concentrations in soils and vegetation. Furthermore, our simulations suggest that P limitation might be an important driver of biomass production efficiency (the fraction of the gross primary productivity used for biomass growth), and that vegetation on old soils has a smaller biomass production rate when P becomes limiting. With this study, we provide a theoretical basis for investigating the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to P availability linking geological and ecological timescales under different environmental settings.

AB  - We synthesise a series of independent but integrated studies on the functioning of a mixed Mediterranean oak forest to demonstrate the tree-soil interactions underpinning a positive feedback process that sustains the coexistence of two oak species. The studies focused on the foliar functional traits, plant regeneration patterns, biogeochemical cycles, soil microbial biomass and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal diversity associated with the co-dominant evergreen Quercus suber and deciduous Quercus canariensis in a Mediterranean forest in southern Spain. Foliar attributes differed between oak species, with Q canariensis having higher nutrient content and lower carbon to nutrient ratios and leaf mass per area than Q. suber. These attributes reflected their distinct resource use strategies and adaptation to high and low resource-availability environments, respectively. Leaf-fall nutrient concentrations were higher in Q. canariensis than in Q. suber and were correlated with concentrations in the fresh leaves. Leaf-fall nutrient concentrations influenced nutrient return, leaf-fall decay rate and the proportion of nutrients released from decomposing leaf-fall, all of which were higher for Q canariensis than for Q. suber. This generated a differential net nutrient input into the soil that led to increased soil nutrient concentrations under the canopy of Q. canariensis as compared to Q suber. The fraction of slowly decomposing leaf-fall that builds up soil organic matter was higher for Q canariensis, further raising the nutrient and moisture retention of its soils. Differences between species in soil properties disappeared with increasing soil depth, which was consistent with the hypothesised leaf-fall-mediated effect. Tree-species-generated changes in soil properties had further impacts on soil organisms. Soil microbial biomass (Cmic) and nutrients (Nmic, Pmic) were higher under Q. canariensis than under Q sober and were positively related to soil moisture content and substrate availability (particularly soil N). The composition of the ECM fungal community shifted between the two oaks in response to changes in the soil properties, particularly soil Ca and pH. Lower ECM phylogenetic diversity and higher abundance of mycorrhizal species with saprophytic abilities were related to the greater soil fertility under Q. canariensis. Overall, the two oak species generated soil conditions that aligned with their resource-use strategies and would enhance their own competitive capabilities, potentially creating a positive feedback. The two Quercus created soil spatial heterogeneity that could enable their coexistence through spatial niche partitioning. This study demonstrates the critical role of aboveground-belowground interactions underpinning forest community composition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exotic earthworms can profoundly alter soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in northern temperate forests, but the mechanisms explaining these responses are not well understood. We compared the soil microbial community (SMC) composition (measured as PLFAs) and enzyme activity between paired earthworm-invaded and earthworm-free plots in northern hardwood forests of New York, USA. We hypothesized that differences in SMCs and enzyme activity between plots would correspond with differences in soil C content and C:N ratios. Relative abundance of several bacterial (mostly gram-positive) PLFAs was higher and that of two fungal PLFAs was lower in earthworm compared to reference plots, largely because of earthworm incorporation of the organic horizon into mineral soil. In surface mineral soil earthworms increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and gram-positive bacterial PLFAs, and decreased fungal (mostly saprotrophic) and several bacterial (gram-negative and non-specific) PLFAs. Earthworms also increased the activities of cellulolytic relative to lignolytic enzymes in surface mineral soil, and the relationships between enzyme activities and components of the SMC suggest a substrate-mediated effect on the SMC and its metabolism of C. A highly significant relationship between components of the SMC and soil C:N also suggests that earthworms reduce soil C:N through functional and compositional shifts in the SMC. Finally, changes in AMF abundances were linked to phosphatase activity, suggesting that earthworms do not necessarily inhibit P-acquisition by AMF-associated plants in our study system. We conclude that the combined influence of earthworm-related changes in physical structure, accessibility and chemistry of organic matter, and relative abundance of certain groups of fungi and bacteria promote C metabolism, in particular by increasing the activities of cellulolytic vs. lignolytic enzymes.

AB  - Correctly estimating the trophic fractionation factors (Delta N-15 and Delta C-13) in controlled laboratory conditions is essential for the application of stable isotope analysis in studies on the trophic structure of soil communities. Laboratory experiments usually suggest large N-15/N-14 and small C-13/C-12 trophic fractionation, but in field studies litter-dwelling microarthropods and other invertebrates are consistently enriched in C-13 relative to plant litter. In the present study, we report data from two laboratory experiments investigating both fungi-collembolans and litter-fungi-collembolans systems. In the fungi-collembolans system, Delta N-15 and Delta C-13 averaged 1.4 +/- A 0.1 and 1.0 +/- A 0.2 aEuro degrees, respectively. In microcosms with fungi-inoculated litter, the difference in delta N-15 between collembolans and plant litter averaged 1.5 +/- A 0.2 aEuro degrees, confirming the relatively small N-15/N-14 trophic fractionation at the basal level of detrital foodwebs reported in numerous field studies. In full agreement with field observations, the difference in delta C-13 between bulk litter and collembolans in laboratory microcosms averaged 3.6 +/- A 0.1 aEuro degrees and only little depended on collembolan species identities or the presence of water-soluble compounds in the litter. We conclude that increased delta C-13 values typical of litter-dwelling decomposers are largely determined by an increased C-13 content in saprotrophic microorganisms.

AB  - The exotic plant, Eupatorium adenophorum, has invaded rapidly across southwest China, damaging native ecosystems and causing great economic losses. Soil microbes, as an important component of belowground community, can drive nutrient cycling and regulate plant competition in terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, knowledge of the soil microbial community and function will enhance our understanding of the mechanism of exotic plant invasive process in natural ecosystems. In this study, we examined the soil microbial community, soil enzyme activity, soil property and plant community along an invasive gradient of E. adenophorum in a southwest Chinese secondary forest. The soil analysis demonstrated that heavy invasion significantly increased the total P and NO (3) (-) -N contents, whereas it significantly decreased the total N and soil organic matter contents. The available P content was significantly decreased by moderate invasion. The E. adenophorum invasion significantly decreased the biomass of total soil microbes, as well as Gram-negative bacteria, actinomycetes, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and non-AM fungi. However, E. adenophorum invasion significantly increased the activities of soil urease, acid phosphatase, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase. Non-metric multidimensional scaling showed that soil microbial composition and soil enzyme composition were significantly different in the three E. adenophorum invaded sites. Partial Mantel tests indicated that plant composition was the most important factor for structuring soil microbial and enzyme compositions. The results suggest that changes in soil microbial community structure and enzyme activity may play an important role in the process of E. adenophorum invasion in a Chinese secondary forest ecosystem.

AB  - To gain a better understanding of how rapidly microbial communities respond to different magnitudes of perturbation that mimic minor or catastrophic disturbances. Two montane sites in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon with adjacent areas of forest and meadow vegetation were studied. A reciprocal transplant experiment evaluated both minor (soil cores remaining in the same vegetation type) or more severe disturbance (soil cores transferred to a different vegetation type). The biomass and composition of the bacterial and fungal communities were measured for 2 years following the establishment of the experiment. Minor disturbance (coring) had little impact on microbial biomass but transferring between vegetation type showed greater fungal biomass in soil incubated in the forest environment. The composition of bacterial communities was not influenced by coring but responded strongly to transfers between vegetation sites, changing to reflect their new environment after 2 years. Fungal community composition responded somewhat to coring, probably from disrupting mycorrhizal fungal hyphae, but more strongly to being transferred to a new environment. The response of the microbial community to major disturbance was rapid, showing shifts reflective of their new environment within 2 years, suggesting that microbial communities have the capacity to quickly adjust to catastrophic disturbances.

AB  - Temperature and substrate stoichiometry can influence soil organic matter (SUM) decomposition, but whether their interactive effect is significant remains unclear. This study explores linkages between substrate stoichiometry and warming-induced patterns of microbial carbon (C) mineralization in boreal forest soils via replacements of native litterfall with Oi material possessing distinct delta C-13 and C:N. Following 120 day incubations of soils from sites similar except for mean annual temperature, we examined exo-enzyme activities, microbial biomass, and delta C-13 of respired CO2 and individual phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) to identify microbial community and decay responses to these experimental manipulations. In accordance with stoichiometric theory, we hypothesized that warming-induced increases in microbial use of naturally low C:N Oea materials and fungal incorporation of Oea would be enhanced when available Oi material exhibited relatively high C:N. These hypotheses were only partially supported. At the warmer site, higher C:N Oi was linked to an enhanced, warming-induced decline in Oi-derived CO2, lower C:N Oi prompted an increase in the warming-induced increase in phenol oxidase activities, and the interaction between temperature and Oi C:N had no influence on the relative abundances or activities of distinct microbial groups. In contrast, responses to Oi C:N and temperature at the cooler site were evident only via changes in the structure and substrate preference of the active microbial community; we observed a similar to 25\% increase in the incorporation of low C:N Oi into fungi relative to bacteria in these soils when they were incubated at a relatively high temperature. The data emphasize the importance of native climate imposing a legacy effect on how these microbial communities respond to temperature and substrate stoichiometry, by governing those communities' adaptive characteristics and the climate-related composition of the SUM on which they depend. That legacy effect is reflected in patterns of decay and in the relative abundances of microbial groups that both decay and generate SOM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition greatly affects ecosystem processes and properties. However, few studies have simultaneously examined the responses of both the above- and belowground communities to N deposition. Here, we investigated the effects of 8years of simulated N deposition on soil microbial communities and plant diversity in a subtropical forest. The quantities of experimental N added (g of N m(-2)year(-1)) and treatment codes were 0 (N0, control), 6 (N1), 12 (N2), and 24 (N3). Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis was used to characterize the soil microbial community while plant diversity and coverage were determined in the permanent field plots. Microbial abundance was reduced by the N3 treatment, and plant species richness and coverage were reduced by both N2 and N3 treatments. Declines in plant species richness were associated with decreased abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, increased bacterial stress index, and reduced soil pH. The plasticity of soil microbial community would be more related to the different responses among treatments when compared with plant community. These results indicate that long-term N deposition has greater effects on the understory plant community than on the soil microbial community and different conservation strategies should be considered.

AB  - Various studies address changes in nitrogen and carbon cycling by exotic plant species, while impacts on phosphorus cycling are understudied. Therefore, we assessed the effects of the introduced Cinchona pubescens Vahl on plant and soil nutrients (especially phosphorus) in the highlands of Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos. Nutrient analyses were carried out on soil, leaf litter, and leaf samples taken from Cinchona, the endemic shrub Miconia robinsoniana Cogn. and the native fern Pteridium arachnoideum (Kaulf.) Maxon. in plots invaded and previously invaded by Cinchona. Cinchona contained significantly more nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in its green leaves than Miconia. Surprisingly, there was no evidence of phosphorus resorption in senesced Cinchona leaves. This was also the case in Miconia leaves, but only in Cinchona-invaded plots. Specific leaf area of Cinchona was significantly higher than of Miconia and Pteridium leaves, as was its litter turnover rate. Total soil nitrogen, ammonium and available phosphorus concentrations were higher in the invaded plots. Leaf litter from these plots also contained more phosphorus, which was positively correlated with the phosphorus concentrations in the soil. These results suggest enhanced nutrient uptake by Cinchona and a faster decomposition of its litter, leading to increased nutrient availability in the soil. An accelerated cycling could promote spread of Cinchona and other introduced species, increasing the risk of further displacement of indigenous plant species in the Santa Cruz highlands.

AB  - Acacia mearnsii is one of the most planted Australian Acacia around the world but is known to be highly invasive, threatening native habitats by competing with indigenous vegetation. The introduction of this species in the Algerian El Kala Biosphere reserve led to the invasion of natural formations to the detriment of Quercus suber, a native tree species. We hypothesized that shifts in soil microbial functions and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal community structure triggered by this exotic Acacia species might correlate with a decrease of the early growth of Q suber. Soil samples were thus collected from 3 different sites where the exotic species was at different stages of invasion in the Algerian El Kala Biosphere reserve, (i) a Q suber forest free of A. mearnsii (site S1), (ii) a Q suber/A. mearnsii mixed forest where the Australian Acacia has been recently detected (site S2) and (iii) pure stands of A. mearnsii formed more than 20 years ago (site S3). Plant growth, EcM community structure associated with Q. suber roots and soil microbial functionalities were assessed for 6 month-old cultures of Q suber in glasshouse conditions. The results clearly demonstrated a strong deleterious impact of A. mearnsii invasion level on soil chemical characteristics, microbial functions and EcM community structure and colonization, correlated to a decrease in the early growth of Q suber seedlings. The current study gives new insights into both the negative impact of exotic species on soil functioning and their effect on indigenous vegetation growth. These results may be used as a basis for improving the conservation practices of native tree species in such degraded areas as a complement of ecological strategies using indigenous ectotrophic early-successional shrub species (eg. Cistus spp.) that our findings have shown to promote EcM multiplication and the early growth of native tree species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Determining the dynamics of carbon (C) as a function of vegetation and residue inputs is important for predicting changes in ecosystem functions and the global C cycle. Litter and soil samples were analyzed from plantations of eastern red cedar (Juniperous virginiana) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and native prairie at the Nebraska National Forest to evaluate the impact of different types of land management on soil C contents and turnover rates. Total soil C to a depth of 1 m was greatest in the cedar stands. Pine ecosystems stored more C in the tree biomass and litter but lost more native prairie C from the soil. The soil C-13 content showed 82\% of the original, and prairie C remained under cedars compared with similar to 45\% under pine. Soil cation contents were greatest overall in cedar soils and lowest in pine. The C content in cedar soils was strongly related to Ca content. Differences in microbial community fatty acid profiles were related to vegetation type, and nutrients explained similar to 60\% of the variation in profiles. Our research indicates that changes in soil C and nutrient content following conversion from prairie to forest are dependent on tree species planted, characteristics of the plant litter, and cation cycling in the plant-soil system.

AB  - Disentangling biotic and abiotic drivers of wild mushroom fruiting is fraught with difficulties because mycelial growth is hidden belowground, symbiotic and saprotrophic supply strategies may interact, and myco-ecological observations are often either discontinuous or too short. Here, we compiled and analyzed 115417 weekly fungal fruit body counts from permanent Swiss inventories between 1975 and 2006. Mushroom fruiting exhibited an average autumnal delay of 12days after 1991 compared with before, the annual number of fruit bodies increased from 1801 to 5414 and the mean species richness doubled from 10 to 20. Intra- and interannual coherency of symbiotic and saprotrophic mushroom fruiting, together with little agreement between mycorrhizal yield and tree growth suggests direct climate controls on fruit body formation of both nutritional modes. Our results contradict a previously reported declining of mushroom harvests and propose rethinking the conceptual role of symbiotic pathways in fungi-host interaction. Moreover, this conceptual advancement may foster new cross-disciplinary research avenues, and stimulate questions about possible amplifications of the global carbon cycle, as enhanced fungal production in moist mid-latitude forests rises carbon cycling and thus increases greenhouse gas exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere.

AB  - Global increases in the rate of atmospheric N deposition have the potential to alter the composition and function of soil microbial communities. Here, we tested the hypothesis that experimental N deposition has altered the composition of active communities of Dikarya fungi. Such a change may underlie previously observed reductions in decomposition and increases in soil organic matter in a long-term field experiment. The actively metabolizing forest floor fungal community was characterized from cDNA clone libraries constructed from 28S fungal rRNA extracted from the forest floor of two northern hardwood stands in the lower peninsula of Michigan. We demonstrate that long-term experimental N deposition altered the composition of the active communities of Dikarya fungi in the forest floor in each of these forest stands. Because forest floor fungi are important decomposers, the alteration of forest floor fungal communities by increasing N deposition may have implications for the cycling and storage of C in forest ecosystems.

AB  - An ectomycorrhiza is a multitrophic association between a tree root, an ectomycorrhizal fungus, free-living fungi and the associated bacterial communities. Enzymatic activities of ectomycorrhizal root tips are therefore result of the contribution from different partners of the symbiotic organ. However, the functional potential of the fungus-associated bacterial communities remains unknown. In this study, a collection of 80 bacterial strains randomly selected and isolated from a soil-ectomycorrhiza continuum (oak-Scleroderma citrinum ectomycorrhizas, the ectomycorrhizosphere and the surrounding bulk soil) were characterized. All the bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequences as members of the genera Burkholderia, Collimonas, Dyella, Mesorhizobium, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium and Sphingomonas. The bacterial strains were then assayed for beta-xylosidase, beta-glucosidase, N-acetyl-hexosaminidase, beta-glucuronidase, cellobiohydrolase, phosphomonoesterase, leucine-aminopeptidase and laccase activities, chitin solubilization and auxin production. Using these bioassays, we demonstrated significant differences in the functional distribution of the bacterial communities living in the different compartments of the soil-ectomycorrhiza continuum. The surrounding bulk soil was significantly enriched in bacterial isolates capable of hydrolysing cellobiose and N-acetylglucosamine. In contrast, the ectomycorrhizosphere appeared significantly enriched in bacterial isolates capable of hydrolysing glucopyranoside and chitin. Notably, chitinase and laccase activities were found only in bacterial isolates belonging to the Collimonas and Pseudomonas genera. Overall, the results suggest that the ectomycorrhizal fungi favour specific bacterial communities with contrasting functional characteristics from the surrounding soil.

AB  - Predicted alterations in belowground plant-allocated C as a result of environmental change may cause compositional shifts in soil microbial communities, and it has been hypothesized that such alterations will influence C mitigation in forest ecosystems. In order to investigate to what degree living trees influence the abundance and activity of mycorrhizal fungi, saprotrophic fungi, and bacteria we used a geostatistical approach to examine natural abundance stable-isotope-ratios of soil microbial PLFAs, respired CO2, and different soil organic C pools in a 100 point grid extending from an area of retention trees into a clear-cut area. Labile C from trees was the major source of C for the fungal communities and influenced the composition of the microbial community and soil respiration rates up to ten meters into the clear-cut. When the input of labile plant C decreased, it appeared that microorganisms became increasingly dependent on recycled C released during microbial turnover, resulting in a decrease in soil respiration. Our findings demonstrate that plants not only influence the structure and function of soil microbial communities but also act as important regulators of belowground C flux, soil C sequestration and, ultimately, soil C stocks.

AB  - We labeled tree saplings of beech and ash with N-15 and C-13 in a greenhouse. Carbon (C) was applied as (CO2)-C-13 to plants and nitrogen (N) was added as (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 to the soil. We hypothesized that C will be transferred from plants to the rhizosphere, subsequently in beech to ectomycorrhiza (EM), in ash to arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and finally to soil animals. We expected the C signal to be more effectively transferred to soil animals in EM as compared to AM systems since EM forms more extensive extramatrical mycelia as compared to AM. For N-15 we hypothesized that it will be taken up by both saprotrophic microorganisms and mycorrhizal fungi and then channeled to-soil animals. After five month, delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of soil animals, EM and fine roots of beech and ash were measured. Litter and soil were hardly enriched in N-15 whereas fine roots of beech and ash were highly enriched suggesting that nitrogen in (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 was predominantly taken up by plants and mycorrhizal fungi but little by saprotrophic microorganisms. Roots of beech and ash were highly enriched in C-13 with maximum values in EM proving that C-13 was translocated into roots and mycorrhizal fungi. Soil animals were a priori assigned to primary decomposers, secondary decomposers and predators. Generally, signatures of soil animals did not significantly vary between beech and ash and therefore were pooled. Primary decomposers had low delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures similar to litter and soil confirming that rhizosphere C and microbial N are of limited importance for primary decomposer taxa. delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of secondary decomposers were higher than those of primary decomposers and spanned a large gradient indicating that certain secondary decomposers rely on root derived C and microbial N, however, none of the secondary decomposers had signatures pointing to exclusive feeding on EM. Unexpectedly, delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures were highest in predators suggesting that they heavily preyed on secondary decomposer species such as the litter dwelling Collembola species Lepidocyrtus cyaneus and species not captured by the heat extraction procedure used for capturing prey taxa, presumably predominantly root associated nematodes. Overall, the results highlight that in particular higher trophic levels rely on carbon originating from other resources than litter with these resources channeled to dominant predators via litter dwelling Collembola species.

AB  - Natural forest disturbance regimes are changing, as evidenced by expansion of the mountain pine beetle (MPB) north and east from British Columbia into pine forests east of the Canadian Rockies. Thus, research that examines potential impacts of shifting disturbance regimes on ecosystem properties and processes in these forests is needed. We examined short-term effects (up to one year after treatment) of three treatments that emulated MPB attack and associated forest management disturbance (i.e., moderate and high intensity simulated MPB attack, salvage harvest) on above-and below-ground properties and processes of mature lodgepole pine forests in MPB's recently expanded range east of the Rockies. While the salvage logging treatment showed dramatic effects on the understory plant community and downed woody material with several less dramatic below-ground responses, there were no effects of the moderate MPB attack, and only limited below-ground responses to the high intensity attack. The salvage logged stands showed decreases in species richness and understory plant cover, increases in small downed wood, litter cover, forest floor pH, and plant available Ca, Mg, and P, and differences in multiple microbial properties compared with the other treatments. The high intensity simulated MPB attack showed increased respiration rates of several carbon substrates compared with the salvage treatment. There was considerable variation among years for many below-ground variables (e.g., multiple soil nutrients, microbial respiration rates and phospholipid fatty acids), and these were unrelated to treatments. For the majority of below-ground response variables, differences among study years rather than differences due to the MPB treatments suggest that inter-annual variability exerts a stronger influence than does disturbance effects of MPB red attack. The lack of potential response to MPB attack in the short-term suggests these forests are resistant to change early after attack, and/or have high ecological inertia. In contrast, salvage logging had immediate and dramatic effects. We don't yet know how these pine forests will develop under this modified disturbance regime of partial canopy disturbance, but it appears likely that salvage logging will push these stands in a potentially very different direction than the modified natural disturbance regime due to MPB will.

AB  - We used a Procrustean superimposition approach associated with regression analysis to test hypotheses regarding the relationship between plant communities and distinct below-ground compartments-soil chemistry (SC) and soil microbial activity (SMA). Additionally, we evaluated litter chemical quality as an interface between the above and below-ground compartments. Plant community, and soil chemical and biochemical data from three post-mining degraded sites under reclamation and from one nearby forest site in the Brazilian Amazon Basin were analyzed. All studied sites presented distinct plant community, litter quality, SC and SMA. Plant community consistently affected the below-ground variation in both SC and SMA compartments. The influence of litter quality was greater in the plant community versus SMA relationship than in the plant community versus SC. Nevertheless, the SC affected significantly the SMA, but without influence of litter quality. Differently from previous studies, our findings suggest that plant community and soil chemistry can affect the soil microbial activity independently. Specifically for our study area, these results point to a rupture of the `in nested' structure of the causal relationship between changes in vegetation, changes in the chemical litter quality, changes in the SC and the response of SMA.

AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate laccase-containing basidiomycete communities at the cDNA and DNA levels and to assess the influences of vegetation and soil types on the basidiomycete communities in forest soils. Soil samples were collected from the upper soil layers of two typical subtropical forests (a broad-leaved forest developed in Karst limestone soil and an artificial coniferous forest with Pinus massoniana in red soil) in China. The basidiomycete communities were characterized by cloning and sequencing of the laccase genes at both the cDNA and DNA levels. Compositions of lignin monomers were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Most of the laccase genes obtained in this study were new, highlighting the research gap of this functional group. The trends of the basidiomycetous laccase gene diversity among the upper soil layers of the two forests were consistent between the cDNA and DNA levels. The Agaricales had high activity because they dominated all the tested soils. However, the total basidiomycete communities reflected at the cDNA and DNA levels were significantly different due to the presence of some quiescent basidiomycetous groups. Almost all of the lignin components were decomposed from the O to the A layers in the two forests, and laccases produced by Agaricales were likely responsible for the decomposition of guaiacyl monomers. Both vegetation and soil types had great influences on the active laccase-containing basidiomycete communities, primarily via the pH, C/N, and the contents of lignin monomers. The cDNA- and DNA-level approaches presented good consistency of diversities but different compositions of laccase-containing basidiomycete communities, thus emphasizing the importance of focusing on laccase genes at the cDNA level in future studies. It is the quality but not the quantity of SOM to determine the diversity and composition of the active laccase-containing basidiomycete communities.

AB  - Many microfungi are able to live in living plant tissues. In contrast to plant pathogens and parasites the so-called endophytic fungi do not cause obvious disease symptoms in their hosts. Nevertheless, they constitute an ubiquitous active component in direct and multitrophic interactions. The present study was conducted to assess the level of overlap of cultivable microfungi in living and decaying tissues of European Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) from a forest stand in North-Eastern Germany. The focus lay on the hypothesized fall-spring relationship of leaf-inhabiting forest endophytes, which means that endophytes from autumn leaves persist as saprobes in litter or dead wood, sporulate and re-invade living leaves in spring. Fungal cultures were isolated from living leaves, leaf litter and dead wood still attached to the tree by dilution-to-extinction cultivation in the years 2007-2010. Analyses of species identity, species richness and species composition were based on microscopic identification and of sequencing the fungal DNA `barcode' ITS (internal transcribed spacer). Species richness of litter-inhabiting microfungi equaled that of wood-inhabiting fungi and exceeded that of leaf endophytes. The most distinctive species assemblage was observed on wood, fungal species composition in living leaves and leaf litter were also significantly different from each other. On the other hand a considerable compositional and phylogenetic overlap between leaf and litter fungi was revealed with phylogenetics, cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling. The taxa accounting most to the similarity between living and decaying leaves belonged to Capnodiales, Xylariales, Diaporthales and Pleosporales. Finally, data from cultivated leaf-inhabiting beech endophytes were compared with a fungal 454 sequence data set from beech phyllosphere. This analysis allowed the partition of species lists into active fungal endophytes, fungal ``epiphytes{''} and dormant fungal propagules.

AB  - Elevated nitrogen (N) deposition in humid tropical regions may exacerbate phosphorus (P) deficiency in forests on highly weathered soils. However, it is not clear how P availability affects soil microbes and soil carbon (C), or how P processes interact with N deposition in tropical forests. We examined the effects of N and P additions on soil microbes and soil C pools in a N-saturated old-growth tropical forest in southern China to test the hypotheses that (1) N and P addition will have opposing effects on soil microbial biomass and activity, (2) N and P addition will alter the composition of the microbial community, (3) the addition of N and P will have interactive effects on soil microbes and (4) addition-mediated changes in microbial communities would feed back on soil C pools. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to quantify the soil microbial community following four treatments: Control, N addition (15 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), P addition (15 g P m(-2) yr(-1)), and N\&P addition (15 g N m(-2) yr(-1) plus 15 g P m(-2) yr(-1)). These were applied from 2007 to 2011. Whereas additions of P increased soil microbial biomass, additions of N reduced soil microbial biomass. These effects, however, were transient, disappearing over longer periods. Moreover, N additions significantly increased relative abundance of fungal PLFAs and P additions significantly increased relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi PLFAs. Nitrogen addition had a negative effect on light fraction C, but no effect on heavy fraction C and total soil C. In contrast, P addition significantly decreased both light fraction C and total soil C. However, there were no interactions between N addition and P addition on soil microbes. Our results suggest that these nutrients are not co-limiting, and that P rather than N is limiting in this tropical forest.

AB  - Increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and rates of nitrogen (N)-deposition to forest ecosystems are predicted to alter the structure and function of soil fungal communities, but the spatially heterogeneous distribution of soil fungi has hampered investigations aimed at understanding such impacts. We hypothesized that soil physical and chemical properties and fungal community composition would be differentially impacted by elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) and N-fertilization in spatially separated field samples, in the forest floor, 0-2,2-5, and 5-10 cm depth intervals in a loblolly pine Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiment. In all soils, quantitative PCR-based estimates of fungal biomass were highest in the forest floor. Fungal richness, based on pyrosequencing of the fungal ribosomal large subunit gene, increased in response to N-fertilization in 0-2 cm and forest floor intervals. Composition shifted in forest floor, 0-2 and 2-5 cm intervals in response to N-fertilization, but the shift was most distinct in the 0-2 cm interval, in which the largest number of statistically significant changes in soil chemical parameters (i.e., phosphorus, organic matter, calcium, pH) was also observed. In the 0-2 cm interval, increased recovery of sequences from the Thelephoraceae, Tricholomataceae, Hypocreaceae, Clavicipitaceae, and Herpotrichiellaceae families and decreased recovery of sequences from the Amanitaceae correlated with N-fertilization. In this same depth interval, Amanitaceae, Tricholomataceae, and Herpotriciellaceae sequences were recovered less frequently from soils exposed to eCO(2) relative to ambient conditions. These results demonstrated that vertical stratification should be taken into consideration in future efforts to elucidate environmental impacts on fungal communities and their feedbacks on ecosystem processes.

AB  - Boreal forest soils function as a terrestrial net sink in the global carbon cycle. The prevailing dogma has focused on aboveground plant litter as a principal source of soil organic matter. Using C-14 bomb-carbon modeling, we show that 50 to 70\% of stored carbon in a chronosequence of boreal forested islands derives from roots and root-associated microorganisms. Fungal biomarkers indicate impaired degradation and preservation of fungal residues in late successional forests. Furthermore, 454 pyrosequencing of molecular barcodes, in conjunction with stable isotope analyses, highlights root-associated fungi as important regulators of ecosystem carbon dynamics. Our results suggest an alternative mechanism for the accumulation of organic matter in boreal forests during succession in the long-term absence of disturbance.

AB  - We investigated the role of polyphenols in soil solution on N dynamics in tropical montane forests, in which soil N mineralization was typically low. We compared two sites on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo, which contrast in soil age (the Tertiary versus Quaternary period). The older site had a much thicker soil organic matter and reduced N availability. Soil solution was collected from twenty lysimeters that were installed at two depths (10 cm and 50 cm) at each of ten random locations at each site, and was fractionated into hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions. The hydrophobic fraction was hydrolyzed to determine the concentration of bound N as amino acids. The mean concentration of phenolics was five times greater in soil solution of the upper horizon at the older N-poor site compared to the younger N-rich site. The mean concentration of hydrolyzed amino acids was twice greater in the upper horizon at the older N-poor site than that at the younger N-rich site; phenolics and amino acids were significantly greater under conifers than under non-conifers within the older site. DOC:DON ratio in soil solution was wider at the older N-poorer site (56) than at the younger N-richer site (34), reflecting the lower quality of litter for the former. We suggest that more protein-polyphenol complexes (PPC) in soil solution are formed at the older site and consequently the recalcitrance of N adds to the soil infertility. The dominance of conifer trees exacerbates the formation of PPC. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Elevated atmospheric CO2 was often shown to stimulate belowground C allocation, but it is uncertain if this increase also alters the structure of soil microbial communities. Here, we assessed the effects of nine years of CO2 enrichment on soil microbial communities of an alpine treeline ecosystem with 35-year-old Lath decidua and Pinus mugo ssp. uncinata trees. We also tracked the C-13 signal of supplemental CO2 in soil-respired CO2, microbial biomass, and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in undisturbed mor-type organic layers. We found a persistently increased soil CO2 efflux (+24\% on average), but negligible effects of elevated CO2 on the biomass and community structure of soil microorganisms under both tree species determined with PLFA and T-RFLP (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism). The C-13 tracing over 9 years revealed that 24-40\% of the soil microbial biomass was composed of `new' plant-derived C. PLFA from gram-negative biomarkers did not significant shift in C-13 by the CO2 addition, while those of gram-negative bacteria were significantly altered. The highest C-13 signals in individual PLFA was found in the fatty acid 18:26)6,9 with 65-80\% new C, indicating that new plant-derived C was primarily incorporated by soil fungi. However, CO2 enrichment did not affect the production of mycelia biomass and the structure and composition of the fungal communities analysed by high-throughput 454-sequencing of genetic markers. Collectively, our results suggest that C flux through the plant soil system will be accelerated but that the biomass and composition of microbial communities will be little affected by rising atmospheric CO2 in organic matter rich treeline soils.

AB  - Soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling are sensitive to changes in environmental factors and play critical roles in the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to natural and anthropogenic perturbations. This study was conducted to quantify the effects of belowground particulate litter (BPL) addition, increased precipitation and their interactions on soil C and N mineralization in two adjacent sites where belowground photosynthate allocation was manipulated through vegetation clipping in a temperate steppe of northeastern China from 2010 to 2011. The results show that BPL addition significantly increase soil C mineralization rate (CMR) and net N mineralization rate (NMR). Although increased precipitation-induced enhancement of soil CMR essentially ceased after the first year, stimulation of soil NMR and net nitrification rate continued into the second year. Clipping only marginally decreased soil CMR and NMR during the two years. There were significant synergistic interactions between BPL addition (and increased precipitation) and clipping on soil CMR and NMR, likely to reflect shifts in soil microbial community structure and a decrease in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi biomass due to the reduction of belowground photosynthate allocation. These results highlight the importance of plants in mediating the responses of soil C and N mineralization to potentially increased BPL and precipitation by controlling belowground photosynthate allocation in the temperate steppe.

AB  - The influence of fertilization with the compost prepared from treated sewage sludge with bark additive and mulching with the fresh forest ectohumus on the soil conditions, chosen parameters of two-and three-year old littleleaf linden seedlings growth as well as the occurrence of soil mites (Acari) was investigated in the paper. The experiments were carried out in 2009-2010 at forest nursery Biale Biota (Forest District Bydgoszcz) on the rusty soil. The whole area of the experiment was irrigated with the use of stationary sprinlding machine. The soil was characterized by the alkaline reaction (pH in H2O was in the range 7.2-7.4), the low content of available potassium and available phosphorus as well as the content of C-org from 35.7 to 38.4 g-kg(-1). The C:N ratio ranged from 14.3 to 14.9. Two-and three-year old seedlings of littleleaf linden grown on plots fertilized with the compost were higher than those cultivated on plots with mineral fertilizer and they were also characterized by the higher number of leaves and the higher leaf area. Mulching which was carried out in September of the first growing season - did not influence significantly on the growth parameters of two-year old seedlings (with the exception of the decrease in a leaf area). In the third growing season the mulching significantly influenced on all the seedling growth parameters tested, and - furthermore - there was also a significant interaction between the both studied treatments in shaping of the all growth parameters (with the exception of the plant height) of littleleaf linden seedlings. The density of mites in the soil was distinctly increased after the mulch-ing treatment, and it was many fold higher as compared to the control plot MC. On the base of the analysis it was found that the mulching and the fertilization with compost prepared from municipal sewage sludge influenced positively on the abundance of mites, especially oribatid mites as well as on their species diversity. Tectocepheus velatus was the most abundant species among the oribatid mites on all the stands of littleleaf linden cultivation. Abundance dynamics of this oribatid species in the two-years period of the study, especially on the variant with mulching and organic fertilization, indicates the upward trend in the number of its population.

AB  - We examined the composition and concentration of amino acids by soil horizon and depth on the Tanana River floodplain in interior Alaska. Soils from mid-successional stages of balsam poplar and white spruce were separated into successive forest floor (Oe/Oa), buried organic horizons (BOHs), and mineral horizons; and water-extractable amino acid composition and concentration were determined by HPLC. The number, depth, and thickness of BOHs were highly variable across the landscape and among replicates of the same stand type, reflecting differences in terrace age, flood frequency, flood intensity, river channel position, vegetation inputs, and decomposition. BOHs generally had lower pH and bulk density, higher moisture content, and greater concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and roots than the surrounding mineral horizons. In each horizon of both successional stages, the soil amino acid pool was dominated by glutamic acid, glutamine, alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, and histidine, which together accounted for approximately 80\% of the total amino acids found. Despite the similar overall amino acid composition among the horizons, proportions of glutamine generally increased with depth and were generally greater in the mineral horizons than in the BOHs, suggesting root exudation or fine root turnover as an amino acid source. In both successional stages, amino acid concentrations were nearly always highest in the Oe/Oa horizon and rapidly decreased with depth. BOHs generally had greater amino acid concentrations than the surrounding mineral horizons in both successional stages, but amino acid concentrations in successive BOHs declined with depth in the soil profile, suggesting that although BOHs do remain as biological hot spots and potential nutrient reservoirs as far down as 60 cm depth, their importance declines over time.

AB  - Disturbance is an important factor in changing ecological processes. Forested ecosystems undergo natural disturbances of fire and windthrow and disturbances involved in management (thinning, harvesting, control burning). Using the New Jersey pine barrens as model system for eastern US mixed forests, we have observed that under conditions of repeated physical soil disruption or,control burning, the pine barrens forest understory can change from ericaceous to graminoid species dominance through suppression of the ericaceous plants. In order to predict changes in soil properties and assess the potential to maintain this alternate herbaceous layer community, replicate manipulation plots were established the Franklin Parker Preserve in the New Jersey pine barrens. The manipulations consisted of: intact forest controls (CONT), canopy tree thinning (THIN) and canopy tree thinning plus ercicaceous stem removal and soil tilling (THIN \& PLOW). The manipulations were designed to increase sunlight penetration to the forest floor and to encourage graminoid plant species establishment. Soil active carbon, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), six hydrolytic enzyme activities and two oxidative enzyme activities under three different treatments were measured. In the 0-10 cm soil depth, we observed that protease and arylsulfatase activity showed a significant decrease in the THIN and THIN \& PLOW treatments compared to CONT, the activities of cellulase and phenol oxidase were significantly lower in THIN than CONT and THIN \& PLOW, whereas the trend of peroxidase activity was opposite. There were no significant differences between treatments for glucosaminase, glucosidase and acid phosphatase activities. For the 10-20 cm soil depth only acid phosphatase and phenol oxidase activity significantly differed between treatments. We found that all enzyme activities except for peroxidase were significantly lower in the 10-20 cm soil horizon than in the 0-10 cm; peroxidase activity was significantly higher in the lower soil horizon. We demonstrated the activities of cellulase, phenoloxidase, arylsulfatase and protease were significantly and positively related to active C, but peroxidase activity was negatively correlated. Less expected is that only phenol oxidase was related to soil MBC, whereas the correlations between peroxidase, phenol oxidase, arysulfatase, protease activities and soil MBN were obvious. By understanding the relationships between microbial activity (enzyme production) and disturbance, we can determine the beneficial effects of many management practices on the potential nutrient availability for subsequent tree growth, since these enzymes are key to nutrient mineralization and carbon dynamics in soil.

AB  - The availability of phosphorus (P) can limit net primary production (NPP) in tropical rainforests growing on highly weathered soils. Although it is well known that plant roots release organic acids to acquire P from P-deficient soils, the importance of organic acid exudation in P-limited tropical rainforests has rarely been verified. Study sites were located in two tropical montane rainforests (a P-deficient older soil and a P-rich younger soil) and a tropical lowland rainforest on Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo to analyze environmental control of organic acid exudation with respect to soil P availability, tree genus, and NPP. We quantified root exudation of oxalic, citric, and malic acids using in situ methods in which live fine roots were placed in syringes containing nutrient solution. Exudation rates of organic acids were greatest in the P-deficient soil in the tropical montane rainforest. The carbon (C) fluxes of organic acid exudation in the P-deficient soil (0.7 mol C m(-2) month(-1)) represented 16.6\% of the aboveground NPP, which was greater than those in the P-rich soil (3.1\%) and in the lowland rainforest (4.7\%), which exhibited higher NPP. The exudation rates of organic acids increased with increasing root surface area and tip number. A shift in vegetation composition toward dominance by tree species exhibiting a larger root surface area might contribute to the higher organic acid exudation observed in P-deficient soil. Our results quantitatively showed that tree roots can release greater quantities of organic acids in response to P deficiency in tropical rainforests.

AB  - Amino sugars in fungal cell walls (such as chitin) represent an important source of nitrogen (N) in many forest soil ecosystems. Despite the importance of this material in soil nitrogen cycling, comparatively little is known about abiotic and biotic controls on and the timescale of its turnover. Part of the reason for this lack of information is the inaccessibility of these materials to classic bulk extraction methods. To address this issue, we used advanced visualization tools to examine transformation pathways of chitin-rich fungal cell wall residues as they interact with microorganisms, soil organic matter and mineral surfaces. lOur goal was to document initial micro-scale dynamics of the incorporation of C-13- and N-15-labeled chitin into fungi-dominated microenvironments in O-horizons of old-growth forest soils. At the end of a 3-week incubation experiment, high-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging of hyphae-associated soil microstructures revealed a preferential association of N-15 with Fe-rich particles. Synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray spectromicroscopy (STXM/NEXA-FS) of the same samples showed that thin organic coatings on these soil microstructures are enriched in aliphatic C and amide N on Fe (hydr) oxides, suggesting a concentration of microbial lipids and proteins on these surfaces. A possible explanation for the results of our micro-scale investigation of chemical and spatial patterns is that amide N from chitinous fungal cell walls was assimilated by hyphae-associated bacteria, resynthesized into proteinaceous amide N, and subsequently concentrated onto Fe (hydr) oxide surfaces. If confirmed in other soil ecosystems, such rapid association of microbial N with hydroxylated Fe oxide surfaces may have important implications for mechanistic models of microbial cycling of C and N.

AB  - Partial removal of the forest humus layer was performed in nitrogen-enriched urban Scots pine forest stands in the northern Finland in order to improve soil conditions for ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, important symbionts of trees. Aboveground part of understory vegetation and the uppermost half of the humus layer were removed (REMOVAL treatment) from sample plots in six urban and eight rural reference forest sites at the beginning of the 2001 growing season. During the seasons 2001-2005, we inventoried sporocarp production of ECM and saprophytic fungi, and in 2003 the recovery of understory vegetation. The REMOVAL treatment resulted in a higher number of fruiting ECM species and sporocarps than controls at the rural, but not at urban sites. The sporocarp number of saprophytic fungi declined in the REMOVAL subplots at the urban sites. The recovery of bryophytes and lichens in the REMOVAL treatment was slow at both the urban and rural sites, whereas Vaccinium dwarf shrub cover, and herb and grass cover returned rapidly at the urban sites. We conclude that the partial vegetation and humus layer removal as a tool to promote the reproduction of ECM fungal species is limited in the boreal urban forests. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Synergistic effects on decomposition in litter mixtures have been suggested to be due to the transfer of nitrogen from N-rich to N-poor species. However, the dominant pathway and the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. We conducted an experiment to investigate and quantify the control mechanisms for nitrogen transfer between two litter species of contrasting nitrogen status (15N labeled and unlabeled Fagus sylvatica and Fraxinus excelsior) in presence and absence of micro-arthropods. We found that 15N was predominantly transferred actively aboveground by saprotrophic fungi, rather than belowground or passively by leaching. However, litter decomposition remained unaffected by N-dynamics and was poorly affected by micro-arthropods, suggesting that synergistic effects in litter mixtures depend on complex environmental interrelationships. Remarkably, more 15N was transferred from N-poor beech than N-rich ash litter. Moreover, the low transfer of 15N from ash litter was insensitive to destination species whereas the transfer of 15N from labeled beech litter to unlabeled beech was significantly greater than the amount of 15N transferred to unlabeled ash suggesting that processes of nitrogen transfer fundamentally differ between litter species of different nitrogen status. Microbial analyses suggest that nitrogen of N-rich litter is entirely controlled by bacteria that hamper nitrogen capture of microbes in the environment supporting the source-theory. In contrast, nitrogen of N-poor fungal dominated litter is less protected and transferable depending on the nitrogen status and the transfer capacity of the microbial community of the co-occurring litter species supporting the gradient-theory. Thus, our results challenge the traditional view regarding the role of N-rich litter in decomposing litter mixtures. We rather suggest that N-rich litter is only a poor nitrogen source, whereas N-poor litter, can act as an important nitrogen source in litter mixtures. Consequently both absolute and relative differences in initial litter C/N ratios of co-occurring litter species need to be considered for understanding nitrogen dynamics in decomposing litter mixtures.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi provide one of the main pathways for carbon (C) to move from trees into soils, where these fungi make significant contributions to microbial biomass and soil respiration. ECM fungal species vary significantly in traits that likely influence C sequestration, such that forest C sequestration potential may be driven in part by the existing community composition of ECM fungi. Moreover, accumulating experimental data show that tree genotypes differ in their compatibility with particular ECM fungal species, i.e. mycorrhizal traits of forest trees are heritable. Those traits are genetically correlated with other traits for which tree breeders commonly select, suggesting that selection for traits of interest, such as disease resistance or growth rate, could lead to indirect selection for or against particular mycorrhizal traits of trees in forest plantations. Altogether, these observations suggest that selection of particular tree genotypes could alter the community composition of symbiotic ECM fungi in managed forests, with cascading effects on soil functioning and soil C sequestration.

AB  - A common finding in multiple CO2 enrichment experiments in forests is the lack of soil carbon (C) accumulation owing to microbial priming of old soil organic matter (SOM). However, soil C losses may also result from the accelerated turnover of young microbial tissues that are rich in nitrogen (N) relative to bulk SOM. We measured root-induced changes in soil C dynamics in a pine forest exposed to elevated CO2 and N enrichment by combining stable isotope analyses, molecular characterisations of SOM and microbial assays. We find strong evidence that the accelerated turnover of root-derived C under elevated CO2 is sufficient in magnitude to offset increased belowground inputs. In addition, the C losses were associated with accelerated N cycling, suggesting that trees exposed to elevated CO2 not only enhance N availability by stimulating microbial decomposition of SOM via priming but also increase the rate at which N cycles through microbial pools.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi obtain both mineral and simple organic nutrients from soil and transport these to plant roots. Natural abundance of stable isotopes (15N and 13C) in fruit bodies and potential enzymatic activities of ECM root tips provide insights into mineral nutrition of these mutualistic partners. By combining rDNA sequence analysis with enzymatic and stable isotope assays of root tips, we hypothesized that phylogenetic affinities of ECM fungi are more important than ECM exploration type, soil horizon and host plant in explaining the differences in mineral nutrition of trees in an African lowland rainforest. Ectomycorrhizal fungal species belonging to extraradical mycelium-rich morphotypes generally displayed the strongest potential activities of degradation enzymes, except for laccase. The signature of 15N was determined by the ECM fungal lineage, but not by the exploration type. Potential enzymatic activities of root tips were unrelated to 15N signature of ECM root tip. The lack of correlation suggests that these methods address different aspects in plant nutrient uptake. Stable isotope analysis of root tips could provide an additional indirect assessment of fungal and plant nutrition that enables enhancement of taxonomic coverage and control for soil depth and internal nitrogen cycling in fungal tissues.

AB  - Bryophytes are a dominant vegetation component of the boreal forest, but little is known about their associated fungal communities, including seasonal variation within them. Seasonal variation in the fungal biomass and composition of fungal communities associated with three widespread boreal bryophytes was investigated using HPLC assays of ergosterol and amplicon pyrosequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of rDNA. The bryophyte phyllosphere community was dominated by Ascomycota. Fungal biomass did not decline appreciably in winter (P = 0.272). Significant host-specific patterns in seasonal variation of biomass were detected (P = 0.003). Although seasonal effects were not the primary factors structuring community composition, collection date significantly explained (P = 0.001) variation not attributed to locality, host, and tissue. Community homogenization and a reduction in turnover occurred with the onset of frost events and subzero air and soil temperatures. Fluctuations in the relative abundance of particular fungal groups seem to reflect the nature of their association with mosses, although conclusions are drawn with caution because of potential methodological bias. The moss-associated fungal community is dynamic, exhibiting seasonal turnover in composition and relative abundance of different fungal groups, and significant fungal biomass is present year-round, suggesting a winter-active fungal community.

AB  - Current atmospheric warming due to increase of greenhouse gases will have severe consequences for the structure and functioning of arctic ecosystems with changes that, in turn, may feed back on the global-scale composition of the atmosphere. During more than two decades, environmental controls on biological and biogeochemical processes and possible atmospheric feedbacks have been intensely investigated at Abisko, Sweden, by long-term ecosystem manipulations. The research has addressed questions like environmental regulation of plant and microbial community structure and biomass, carbon and nutrient pools and element cycling, including exchange of greenhouse gases and volatile organic compounds, with focus on fundamental processes in the interface between plants, soil and root-associated and free-living soil microorganisms. The ultimate goal has been to infer from these multi-decadal experiments how subarctic and arctic ecosystems will respond to likely environmental changes in the future. Here we give an overview of some of the experiments and main results.

AB  - Fungi in the Agaricomycetes (Basidiomycota) are the primary decomposers in temperate forests of dead wood on and in the forest soil. Through the use of isolation techniques selective for saprotrophic Agaricomycetes, a variety of wood decay fungi were isolated from a northern hardwood stand in the Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. In particular, Hypholoma lateritium (Schaeff.: Fr.) P. Kumm. was isolated from basidiocarps, decaying Acer rubrum L. logs, the Oe organic soil horizon, and the E and BC mineral soil horizons. Identification was confirmed by sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region of nuclear ribosomal DNA. All isolates had identical sequences in this region to previously published sequences for the species; some were monokaryotic and simple-septate and others were dikaryotic, with clamp connections. Isolates were further characterized by banding patterns (DNA fingerprints) produced with PCR primers based in simple repetitive sequences and the minisatellite M13. Nine dikaryotic isolates from basidiocarps and from soil horizons Oe, E, and BC had identical fingerprint patterns with all primers tested. The confirmed presence of H. lateritium suggests that this fungus could form a mycelial translocation network that bridges mineral and organic soil horizons and decaying logs.

AB  - This study utilized individual senesced sugar maple and beech leaves as natural sampling units within which to quantify saprotrophic fungal diversity. Quantifying communities in individual leaves allowed us to determine if fungi display a classic taxaarea relationship (species richness increasing with area). We found a significant taxaarea relationship for sugar maple leaves, but not beech leaves, consistent with Wright's species-energy theory. This suggests that energy availability as affected plant biochemistry is a key factor regulating the scaling relationships of fungal diversity. We also compared taxa rank abundance distributions to models associated with niche or neutral theories of community assembly, and tested the influence of leaf type as an environmental niche factor controlling fungal community composition. Among rank abundance distribution models, the zero-sum model derived from neutral theory showed the best fit to our data. Leaf type explained only 5\% of the variability in community composition. Habitat (vernal pool, upland or riparian forest floor) and site of collection explained > 40\%, but could be attributed to either niche or neutral processes. Hence, although niche dynamics may regulate fungal communities at the habitat scale, our evidence points towards neutral assembly of saprotrophic fungi on individual leaves, with energy availability constraining the taxaarea relationship.

AB  - Plant diversity is considered one factor structuring soil fungal communities because the diversity of compounds in leaf litter might determine the extent of resource heterogeneity for decomposer communities. Lowland tropical rain forests have the highest plant diversity per area of any biome. Since fungi are responsible for much of the decomposition occurring in forest soils, understanding the factors that structure fungi in tropical forests may provide valuable insight for predicting changes in global carbon and nitrogen fluxes. To test the role of plant diversity in shaping fungal community structure and function, soil (0-20 cm) and leaf litter (O horizons) were collected from six established 1-ha forest census plots across a natural plant diversity gradient on the Isthmus of Panama. We used 454 pyrosequencing and phospholipid fatty acid analysis to evaluate correlations between microbial community composition, precipitation, soil nutrients, and plant richness. In soil, the number of fungal taxa increased significantly with increasing mean annual precipitation, but not with plant richness. There were no correlations between fungal communities in leaf litter and plant diversity or precipitation, and fungal communities were found to be compositionally distinct between soil and leaf litter. To directly test for effects of plant species richness on fungal diversity and function, we experimentally re-created litter diversity gradients in litter bags with 1, 25, and 50 species of litter. After 6 months, we found a significant effect of litter diversity on decomposition rate between one and 25 species of leaf litter. However, fungal richness did not track plant species richness. Although studies in a broader range of sites is required, these results suggest that precipitation may be a more important factor than plant diversity or soil nutrient status in structuring tropical forest soil fungal communities.

AB  - A more detailed mechanistic understanding of how low molecular weight (MW) carbon (C) substrates are mineralized within the rhizosphere by soil microbial communities is crucial to accurately model terrestrial C fluxes. Currently, most experiments regarding soil C dynamics are conducted ex-situ (laboratory) and can fail to account for key variables (e.g. temperature and soil water content) which vary in-situ. In addition, ex-situ experiments are often highly invasive, e.g. severing root and mycorrhizal networks, changing the input and concentrations of low MW exudates within soil. The aim of this study was to directly compare the mineralization rates of 31 common low MW C substrates under ex- and in-situ conditions. In addition, we also assessed the inter-annual field variability of substrate mineralization rates. We added trace concentrations of 31 individual C-14-labelled common low MW C substrates into the top soil of an agricultural grassland and monitored the mineralization rates by capturing (CO2)-C-14 evolved from the soil over 7 d. Our results showed that the contribution of low MW C components to soil respiration was highly reproducible between parallel studies performed either in-situ or ex-situ. We also found that differences in the mineralization of individual compounds were more variable inter-annually in the field than between the laboratory and the field. Our results suggest that laboratory-based C mineralization data can be used to reliably parameterize C models but that multiple experimental measurements should be made over time to reduce uncertainty in model parameter estimation.

AB  - The effects of biodiversity of aboveground organisms have been widely investigated in a range of ecosystems, yet whether similar responses are also seen in belowground microbial communities, such as ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, are little understood. We investigated, in vitro, the effects of a gradient of 1-8 species of EM fungi interacting with substratum carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio on biomass production and CO2 efflux. The model experimental systems enabled us to recover and measure biomass of individuals within communities and calculate net selection and complementarity effects. Both biomass and CO2 efflux increased with species richness particularly under high N concentrations. Moreover, net biodiversity effects were largely positive, driven by both selection and complementarity effects. Our results reveal, in pure culture, the implications of EM species richness on community productivity and C cycling, particularly under high N conditions, and constitute the basis for future experiments under natural conditions.

AB  - Aims There is evidence that increased N inputs to boreal forests, via atmospheric deposition or intentional fertilization, may impact negatively on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi leading to a reduced flux of plant-derived carbon (C) back to the atmosphere via ECM. Our aim was to investigate the impact of N fertilization of a Pinus sylvestris (L.) forest stand on the return of recently photoassimilated C via the ECM component of soil respiration. Methods We used an in situ, large-scale, C-13-CO2 isotopic pulse labelling approach and monitored the C-13 label return using soil gas efflux chambers placed over three different types of soil collar to distinguish between heterotrophic (R-H), autotrophic (R-A; partitioned further into contributions from ECM hyphae and total R-A) and total (R-S) soil respiration. Results The impact of N fertilization was to significantly reduce R-A, particularly respiration via extramatrical ECM hyphae. ECM hyphal flux in control plots showed substantial spatial variability, resulting in mean flux estimates exceeding estimates of total R-A, while ECM contributions to R-A in N treated plots were estimated at around 30\%. Conclusion Significant impacts on soil C cycling may be caused by reduced plant C allocation to ECM fungi in response to increased N inputs to boreal forests; ecosystem models so far lack this detail.

AB  - Although decomposer fungi have been recognized to play important roles in forest carbon and nutrient cycling as well as soil humus formation, their effects on forest dynamics, such as tree regeneration, are far less well understood than the effects of symbiotic and pathogenic fungi. In this study, I focused on tree regeneration on fallen woody debris, ``nurse logs{''}. I examined the effects of wood decomposer fungi on species composition and population densities of tree seedlings (height <50 cm) established on these logs. In an abandoned tract of coppice forest in Honshu. Japan, a thick litter layer had accumulated on the forest floor and seedlings of the small-seeded pioneer tree species Clethra barbinervis (Ericales) were found to be preferentially established on rotting fallen logs of the Japanese red pine Pinus densiflora. C. barbinervis seedling establishment was considerably reduced on soil probably because there were impediments to colonization on the ground, such as the thick litter layer, which was less well developed on logs. In contrast, larger-seeded species such as Aphananthe aspera, Carpinus spp., Quercus serrata, and Rhus trichocarpa preferentially established on soil. Characteristics of wood decomposition by fungi varied among logs, and this variability significantly influenced C barbinervis seedling density. Seedling density was significantly higher on brown-rotted logs than that on logs belonging to other decay types. Wood pH was lower in brown-rotted logs than that in logs belonging to other decay types and was negatively correlated with seedling density. Thus, pine coarse woody debris and the functional diversity of wood inhabiting fungi influence the establishment of diverse tree seedlings in this abandoned Japanese coppice forest.

AB  - Litter decay rates often correlate with the initial ratios of lignin : nitrogen (N) or lignin : cellulose in litter. However, the chemical and microbial mechanisms that give rise to these patterns are still unclear. To identify these mechanisms, we studied the decomposition of a model plant system, Arabidopsis thaliana, in which plants were manipulated to have low levels of lignin, cellulose, or litter N. Nitrogen fertilizer often increases the loss of cellulose, but it suppresses the breakdown of lignin in plant litter. To understand the mechanisms driving these patterns, we decomposed plants in litterbags for one year in control and N-fertilized plots in an Alaskan boreal forest. We found that litter N had a positive effect on total mass loss because it increased the loss of lignin, N, and soluble C. Lignin had a negative effect on rates of total litter mass loss due to decreases in the loss of cellulose and hemicellulose. Cellulose had a positive effect on lignin loss, supporting the concept of a ``priming effect'' for lignin breakdown. However, the low-cellulose plants also lost more of their original cellulose compared to the other plant types, indicating that decomposers mined the litter for cellulose despite the presence of lignin. Low-lignin litter had higher fungal biomass and N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG, a chitinase) activity, suggesting that lignin restricted fungal growth and may have influenced competitive interactions between decomposers. Nitrogen fertilization increased NAG activity in the early stages of decay. In the later stages, N fertilization led to increased cellulase activity on the litters and tended to reduce lignin losses. The transition over time from competition among decomposers to high cellulase activity and suppressed lignin loss under N fertilization suggests that, in N-limited systems, N fertilization may alter decomposer community structure by favoring a shift toward cellulose- and mineral-N users.

AB  - 1. During the next century, atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is projected to more than double, potentially leading to a decline in plant diversity as well as a change in plant community composition and structure. 1. During the next century, atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is projected to more than double, potentially leading to a decline in plant diversity as well as a change in plant community composition and structure. 2. In a decade-long field experiment, simulated atmospheric N deposition has slowed litter decay, resulting in an accumulation of forest floor (i.e. Oi \& Oe horizons). We reasoned that a greater forest floor mass under simulated N deposition would impose a physical barrier to sugar maple Acer saccharum seedling establishment, thereby reducing seedling populations of an ecologically and economically important tree species. 3. To test this idea, we first quantified sugar maple seedling abundance in replicate northern hardwood forest stands receiving ambient atmospheric N (7-12 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and experimental atmospheric N deposition, simulating future amounts in eastern North America (ambient plus 30 kg NO3-) N ha(-1) year(-1)). Then, we experimentally manipulated forest floor mass under ambient and simulated N deposition treatments. Finally, we transplanted first-year established seedlings into areas receiving ambient and simulated N deposition and quantified their mortality after 1 year. 4. First-year seedling abundance did not differ under ambient and simulated N deposition; however, there were greater abundances of second-and third-to-fifth-year seedlings under ambient N deposition (P < 0.001). In all cases, experimental manipulation to increase forest floor mass, equivalent to that under simulated N deposition, resulted in significantly (P = 0.001) fewer established individuals, regardless of whether the greater forest floor mass occurred under ambient or simulated N deposition. Finally, fewer 1-year-old transplanted seedlings survived when grown under simulated N, albeit that result was not statistically significant. 5. Synthesis and applications. The slowing of decay and the accumulation of forest floor under anthropogenic N deposition can negatively impact seedling survival and potentially alter stand development and structural diversity. As atmospheric N deposition increases globally, it becomes necessary to understand the mechanisms that lead to population changes for ecologically important tree species. The responses we document should be considered in simulations of future of forest dynamics, as atmospheric N deposition continues to increase, specifically when sugar maple life-history traits are included to simulate regeneration, structural diversity and stand development.

AB  - Soils of coniferous forest ecosystems are important for the global carbon cycle, and the identification of active microbial decomposers is essential for understanding organic matter transformation in these ecosystems. By the independent analysis of DNA and RNA, whole communities of bacteria and fungi and its active members were compared in topsoil of a Picea abies forest during a period of organic matter decomposition. Fungi quantitatively dominate the microbial community in the litter horizon, while the organic horizon shows comparable amount of fungal and bacterial biomasses. Active microbial populations obtained by RNA analysis exhibit similar diversity as DNA-derived populations, but significantly differ in the composition of microbial taxa. Several highly active taxa, especially fungal ones, show low abundance or even absence in the DNA pool. Bacteria and especially fungi are often distinctly associated with a particular soil horizon. Fungal communities are less even than bacterial ones and show higher relative abundances of dominant species. While dominant bacterial species are distributed across the studied ecosystem, distribution of dominant fungi is often spatially restricted as they are only recovered at some locations. The sequences of cbhI gene encoding for cellobiohydrolase (exocellulase), an essential enzyme for cellulose decomposition, were compared in soil metagenome and metatranscriptome and assigned to their producers. Litter horizon exhibits higher diversity and higher proportion of expressed sequences than organic horizon. Cellulose decomposition is mediated by highly diverse fungal populations largely distinct between soil horizons. The results indicate that low-abundance species make an important contribution to decomposition processes in soils.

AB  - Non-native tree species have been widely planted or have become naturalized in most forested landscapes. It is not clear if native trees species collectively differ in ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) diversity and communities from that of non-native tree species. Alternatively, EMF species community similarity may be more determined by host plant phylogeny than by whether the plant is native or non-native. We examined these unknowns by comparing two genera, native and non-native Quercus robur and Quercus rubra and native and non-native Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra in a 35-year-old common garden in Poland. Using molecular and morphological approaches, we identified EMF species from ectomycorrhizal root tips and sporocarps collected in the monoculture tree plots. A total of 69 EMF species were found, with 38 species collected only as sporocarps, 18 only as ectomycorrhizas, and 13 both as ectomycorrhizas and sporocarps. The EMF species observed were all native and commonly associated with a Holarctic range in distribution. We found that native Q. robur had ca. 120\% higher total EMF species richness than the non-native Q. rubra, while native P. sylvestris had ca. 25\% lower total EMF species richness than non-native P. nigra. Thus, across genera, there was no evidence that native species have higher EMF species diversity than exotic species. In addition, we found a higher similarity in EMF communities between the two Pinus species than between the two Quercus species. These results support the naturalization of non-native trees by means of mutualistic associations with cosmopolitan and novel fungi.

AB  - Glomalin is a hydrophobic, heat-stable, and recalcitrant glycoprotein produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The glomalin is extracted from the hyphae or from the soil through the use of sodium citrate (20-50 mM; pH 7.0 or 8.0) at high temperature (121 degrees C) and is quantified by ELISA or Bradford methods. Soil characteristics, climatic conditions, land use systems, agricultural practices, presence and type of vegetation, among other factors, influence the amount of glomalin produced by AMF. The `glue' property of glomalin helps to fixate soil particles, favoring the formation of stable aggregates. Glomalin sequesters heavy metals, reducing the availability and the risk of toxicity of these elements for organisms and plants grown in polluted soils. Depending on the extraction procedure and the origin of the soil, between 28 to 45\% dry weight of the glomalin molecule is carbon and 0.9 to 7.3\% is nitrogen, representing up to 4 to 5\% of total C and N of the soil. Despite the important contribution of glomalin, studies are needed to reformulate the extraction protocol and to identify its physiological function for the AMF, their stocks in different ecosystems, the organisms responsible for its decomposition and consumption, and the AMF species producing more of this protein in the soil.

AB  - Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi (ERM) may specialize in capturing nutrients from their host's litter as a strategy for regulating nutrient cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. In spite of their potential significance, we know little about the structure of ERM fungal communities and the genetic basis of their saprotrophic traits (e.g., genes encoding extracellular enzymes). Rhododendron maximum is a model ERM understory shrub that influences the nutrient cycles of montane hardwood forests in the southern Appalachians (North Carolina, USA). We sampled ERM roots of R. maximum from organic and mineral soil horizons and identified root fungi by amplifying and sequencing internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) collected from cultures and clones. We observed 71 fungal taxa on ERM roots, including known symbionts Rhizoscyphus ericae and Oidiodendron maius, putative symbionts from the Helotiales, Chaetothyriales, and Sebacinales, ectomycorrhizal symbionts, and saprotrophs. Supporting the idea that ERM fungi are adept saprotrophs, richness of root-fungi was greater in organic than in mineral soil horizons. To study the genetic diversity of oxidative enzymes that contribute to decomposition, we amplified and sequenced a portion of genes encoding multicopper oxidases (MCOs) from ERM ascomycetes. Most fungi possessed multiple copies of MCO sequences with strong similarities to known ferroxidases and laccases. Our findings indicate that R. maximum associates with a taxonomically and ecologically diverse fungal community. The study of MCO gene diversity and expression may be useful for understanding how ERM root fungi regulate the cycling of nutrients between the host plant and the soil environment.

AB  - Stump removal procedure increases the extent of exposed mineral soil in the clear felled areas. In this study, our aim was to find out whether the early growth and mycorrhization of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seedlings differ between stump removal and mounding sites. Stumps were harvested from five one-hectare study sites and other five sites were mounded after clear felling. Twenty seedlings were planted on mounds at each study site. Although the height of spruce seedlings did not differ between the treatments after three growing periods, their mean growth was ca. 10\% higher at the stump removal sites. The community of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) in the seedling roots did not differ between the treatments. The high mycorrhization rate in the nursery still remained after two and three growing seasons in the field and diversity of ECM community slightly increased during the first years. Our results indicate some positive although rather small and transient effects of stump removal on the performance of planted spruce seedlings. Longer-term studies are needed to fully understand the effects of stump removal on the later seedling development and their symbiotic interactions with mycorrhizal fungi.

AB  - Distinct aggregations of fungal hyphae and rhizomorphs, or ``mats{'' formed by some genera of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi are common features of soils in coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest. We measured in situ respiration rates of Piloderma mats and neighboring non-mat soils in an old-growth Douglas-fir forest in western Oregon to investigate whether there was higher respiration from mats, and to estimate mat contributions to total soil respiration. We found that areas where Piloderma mats colonized the organic horizon often had higher soil surface flux than nonmats, with the relative increase in respiration averaging 16\% across two growing seasons. Both soil physical factors and biochemistry were related to the higher surface flux of mat soils. When soil moisture was high, soil CO2 production was concentrated into near-surface soil horizons where mats tend to colonize, resulting in greater apparent differences in respiration between mat and non-mat soils. Respiration rates were also correlated with the activity of chitin-degrading soil enzymes. This finding supports the notion that the abundance of fungal biomass in EcM mats is an important driver of C and N cycling. We found Piloderma mats present across 57\% of the exposed soil, and use this value to estimate a respiratory contribution from mats at the stand-scale of about 9\% of total soil respiration. The activity of EcM mats, which includes both EcM fungi and microbial associates, appeared to constitute a substantial portion of total soil respiration in this old-growth Douglas-fir forest.

AB  - Saprotrophic microbes are typically credited with producing extracellular enzymes that recycle organic matter, though roots and mycorrhizal fungi also can contribute and may compete with the saprotrophs. We examined extracellular enzyme activity associated with the mycorrhizospheres of arbuscular mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal, dual-colonized (arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal), and ericoid mycorrhizal plants in a fire chronosequence in Alaska. Bulk soil and soil from beneath host plants were gathered in July 2004 and assayed for five enzymes that target organic C, P, and N substrates. Compared to bulk soil, activities of the C-targeting enzymes beta-1,4-glucosidase and peroxidase were lower in arbuscular mycorrhizospheres and ericoid mycorrhizospheres, respectively. Moreover, extracellular enzyme activity varied among mycorrhizosphere types. Specifically, N-targeting leucine aminopeptidase was highest in arbuscular mycorrhizospheres, followed by ericoid and ectomycorrhizal/dual-colonized mycorrhizospheres; beta-1,4-glucosidase had the reverse pattern. In addition, enzymatic stoichiometry suggested that extracellular enzyme producers invested more in C-acquisition than in N-acquisition in recent lire scars compared to mature forests. These data extend previous findings that roots and mycorrhizal fungi compete with saprotrophs by showing that the strength of this effect varies by mycorrhizal host. As a result the community composition of mycorrhizal host plants might mediate enzymatic activity in boreal soils. (c) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - A process-based modeling framework is developed to examine the control that the soil moisture and soil carbon dynamics have on phosphorus (P) availability. The model accounts for soil moisture controls on several key fluxes that regulate P availability, including the decomposition rate of litter and humus, the mortality rate of microbes, the plant P demand and leaching of P from the rooting zone. To examine these dynamics over a wide range of time scales (i.e., from daily to seasonal to annual) we couple a zero-dimensional stochastic soil moisture model with a soil carbon model and a soil P model, all of which are run at the daily time scale. The soil carbon model accounts for the dynamics of the litter pool, humus pool, and microbial biomass pool, while the soil P model includes two inorganic P pools and four organic P pools that are coupled with the soil carbon pools. A mechanism is included in this framework to account for the contribution of enzymatic release to P availability, which has been shown to be an important source of P under conditions of low P availability. The model is applied to a Cerrado ecosystem located in Central Brazil where the phosphorus, carbon and hydrologic cycles have been well documented. Despite this application to a specific system, the modeling framework developed here is general and could be applied to any P-limited ecosystem for studies that seek to examine the controls on P-availability over time scales ranging from weeks to years. Results indicate that the model accurately captures the key driving variables controlling both the short-term (i.e., day to week) and long-term (i.e., year to decade) phosphorus, soil moisture and carbon dynamics. The effect of stochastic rainfall variability on P cycling is examined by running long-term simulations to obtain a probabilistic characterization of the state variables and fluxes under different rainfall regimes. The effect of a change in the precipitation regime suggests that such changes can significantly affect the dynamics of state variables and fluxes controlling P-availability. Moreover, results from the model illustrate the importance of the microbial retention of P. as a P cycling and conserving mechanism for P-limited ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mycorrhizal fungi that form hypogeous sporocarps are an important component of the temperate forest. soil community. In many regions, such as the Nothofagus forest in the Patagonian Andes, this group of fungi has been poorly studied. Here we examined the spring and autumn community composition of ``sequestrate fungi{''}, based on sporocarp production in pure forests of Nothofagus dombeyi (evergreen) and N. pumilio (deciduous). We investigated the possible relationships between these communities and environmental factors over 2 y. The rarefaction curves and the minimal richness estimates converged at nearly the same level for each forest, type, and the asymptotes suggested that the sampling effort was sufficient to capture most of the hypogeous sporocarp richness in these forest stands. In total 27 species were recovered. Basidiomycota, Ascomycota and Glomeromycota respectively accounted for nine, two and one genera. Species richness of hypogeous sporocarps varied in relation to forest type but not to season (fall and spring), whereas sporocarp biomass varied according to an interaction between season and forest type. Species richness and sporocarp biomass were positively correlated with rainfall and negatively correlated with altitude. In addition sporocarp species richness was positively related to number of trees per transect. We found that two different. forest stands, each dominated by different species of Nothofagus, exhibited different hypogeous sporocarp communities.

AB  - Species richness, abundance and composition of epigeous macrofungi were monitored at 48 grids across four jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest ecosystems in south-west Western Australia as part of an integrated monitoring project to examine responses to different timber harvesting and regeneration treatments. Forest that had never been harvested or had not been harvested for over 40 years was used as a reference, and compared to forest that had undergone shelterwood/selective cutting and gap release treatment after 1988. Silvicultural treatment also included post-harvest burning. All epigeous species of macrofungi and their abundance were recorded from autumn surveys at each grid. A total of 450 species were recorded. Overall mean species richness and abundance was similar but the composition of species assemblages contributing to macrofungal communities differed significantly between silvicultural treatments and reference forest. Sixty-nine species were restricted to reference forest while 35 were restricted to shelterwood/selective cut and 62 to gap release treatment. In all treatments, the overall mean number of species per grid recorded fruiting on soil was 2-4 times higher than that recorded on litter or wood. Species richness of sporophores recorded on both soil and litter was similar for all treatments, but was significantly lower on wood in reference forest compared to the gap release treatment. Mean sporophore abundance was significantly higher on litter and lower on wood in reference forest compared with silviculturally treated forest. Because fire is an integral part of jarrah forest silviculture, it was not possible to separate the singular effect that either tree removal or fire had on macrofungal communities. However, in different time-since-treatment classes the overall composition of species assemblages was different, but species richness and abundance for each silvicultural treatment were similar. Each forest ecosystem supported its own unique fungal community, which supports the concept of ecosystems in jarrah forest based on forest structure and understory vegetation resulting from variation in climate, soils and landforms. Current conservation policy and silviculture practice in jarrah forest produces a landscape mosaic containing early succession stands through to mature forest across the landscape, which is important for the maintenance of fungal biodiversity. Much of the fungal population in jarrah forest, however, remains unknown and only a long-term commitment to survey and monitoring will improve knowledge on the diversity and ecology of these important organisms and ensure their consideration in future management decisions.

AB  - Boreal ecosystems store 10-20\% of global soil carbon and may warm by 4-7 degrees C over the next century. Higher temperatures could increase the activity of boreal decomposers and indirectly affect decomposition through other ecosystem feedbacks. For example, permafrost melting will likely alleviate constraints on microbial decomposition and lead to greater soil CO2 emissions. However, wet boreal ecosystems underlain by permafrost are often CH4 sources, and permafrost thaw could ultimately result in drier soils that consume CH4, thereby offsetting some of the greenhouse warming potential of soil CO2 emissions. Climate change is also likely to increase winter precipitation and snow depth in boreal regions, which may stimulate decomposition by moderating soil temperatures under the snowpack. As temperatures and evapotranspiration increase in the boreal zone, fires may become more frequent, leading to additional permafrost loss from burned ecosystems. Although post-fire decomposition could also increase due to higher soil temperatures, reductions in microbial biomass and activity may attenuate this response. Other feedbacks such as soil drying, increased nutrient mineralization, and plant species shifts are either weak or uncertain. We conclude that strong positive feedbacks to decomposition will likely depend on permafrost thaw, and that climate feedbacks will probably be weak or negative in boreal ecosystems without permafrost. However, warming manipulations should be conducted in a broader range of boreal systems to validate these predictions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Picea abies logs were inoculated with Resinicium bicolor, Fomitopsis pinicola or left un-inoculated and placed in an old-growth boreal forest. Mass loss and fungal community data were collected after 6 yr to test whether simplification of the fungal community via inoculation affects mass loss and fungal community development. Three techniques were used to survey communities: (1) observation of fruiting structures; (2) culturing on media; and (3) cloning and sequencing of ITS rDNA. Fruit body surveys detected the smallest number of species (18, 3.8 per log), DNA-based methods detected the most species (72, 31.7 per log), and culturing detected an intermediate number (23, 7.2 per log). Initial colonizer affected community development and inoculation with F. pinicola led to significantly greater mass loss. Relationships among fungal community composition, community richness and mass loss are complex and further work is needed to determine whether simplification of fungal communities affects carbon sequestration in forests.

AB  - Current knowledge of the succession of fungi in decaying wood is mostly based on fruit bodies and in vitro culture. Here, we investigated the changing community of metabolically active fungi during the decomposition of fallen Picea abies logs by directly extracting and barcode sequencing precursor rRNA. We also compared rRNA-derived amplicons of the 18S and ITS regions in 21 isolates and discuss the use of RNA as a marker of metabolically active fungi. The richness of active fungi, revealed as separated bands in DGGE, peaked in logs at an advanced stage of decay. Soft-rot fungi were common in the early stages but white- and brown-rot fungi became dominant as decay progressed. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were detected at an early stage, and they became the most abundant group in the late stages of succession. A comparison of rRNA-derived amplicons revealed that although ITS was detected in the form of precursor rRNA, introns within 18S rDNA were already spliced. As such, rRNA- and rDNA-derived amplicons would yield different profiles of active and total communities if profiling method is affected by amplicon length.

AB  - Forest dieback caused by climate-change associated stresses and insect outbreaks has emerged as a global concern, and the biogeochemical consequences of this phenomenon need to be elucidated. We measured biological and chemical traits of soil beneath live trees or trees recently killed by a mountain-pine-beetle outbreak in a subalpine coniferous forest in the Front Range of Colorado. We focused on the top 5 cm of mineral soil just beneath the O horizon and measured microbial biomass, soil invertebrate abundance and composition, and soil chemical characteristics. With the termination of inputs from rhizodeposition, mycorrhizal fungal turnover and fine root turnover, soil total carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) in the mineral soil at three sites decreased by 38-49\% and 26-45\%, respectively. Tree mortality was associated with reduced soil microbial biomass but soil nematode and microarthropod densities were unchanged. Nematode trophic structure was altered with an increased proportion of bacterial feeders. Soil inorganic N concentrations were inversely correlated to microbial C:N ratios. Tree death was associated with increased soil pH, a possible loss of calcium (Ca2+), but an accumulation of soil inorganic N, largely as NH4+. Our results suggest that forest dieback results in rapid C and N loss from surface mineral soils and that the accumulation of soil inorganic N, the reduction in microbial biomass, and the more bacterial-based soil food web increase the potential of enhanced N loss from affected ecosystems.

AB  - Within the framework of Sikfokut DIRT (Detritus Input and Removal Treatments) Project, we have been examining the extent to which microbial activities of soils are influenced by detritus inputs of diverse quantities and qualities. The experimental site is located in the south part of the Bukk Mountains in North Eastern Hungary. This forest is a semi-natural stand (Quercetum petraeae-cerris community) without forest management The six treatments established are as follows: three treatments involving detritus removal (No Litter, No Roots, No Inputs), two treatments involving detritus duplication (Double Litter, Double Wood) and a control treatment The study intends to present the results of saccharase and arylsulphatase activity examinations. Our hypothesis was that detritus reduction causes significantly greater influence on soil enzyme activities than detritus increase of the same extent. The general purpose of the project is to reveal the connection between modifications of detritus production and changes of climatic conditions and land use. It also studies how the modifications, decreases or increases in detritus production influence organic material content, and physical, chemical or biological processes of soils. Saccharase and arylsulphatase activities were measured three and a half years after the establishment of the plots; thus having enough time for the development of different ecological conditions at our disposal. Significant differences were detectable between the treatments for both enzymes. Two separate groups of treatments could be distinguished. The treatments with additional aboveground inputs (Double Litter, Double Wood) and the control (C) revealed higher activities, while a lower sometimes significantly lower enzyme activity characterized the other three, removal treatments (No Litter, No Roots, No Inputs). As for the Double Litter, Double Wood and Control treatments, no significant difference was detectable, although the latter two revealed higher values of enzyme activities than the former one. We found that soil moisture content was correlated with the two soil enzyme activities, especially that of the arylsulphatase. A much weaker correlation was found between the enzyme activities and soil moisture content in the soils that were wetter and poorer in substrates (No Roots and No Inputs treatments). Seasonal differences also involved the diverse moisture contents, while the effect of temperature could hardly be observed during the examinations (due to the nature of methods). In the case of both enzymes, the highest activities were detected during the wetter period, in spring. The three detritus removal treatments influenced enzyme activities in different ways. As for saccharase, it was the removal of belowground detritus that caused the greatest influence. However, in the case of arylsulphatase, it was the soil moisture content that influenced activity to the greatest extent in detritus removal treatments. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB  - Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition can increase forest growth. Because N deposition commonly increases foliar N concentrations, it is thought that this increase in forest growth is a consequence of enhanced leaf-level photosynthesis. However, tests of this mechanism have been infrequent, and increases in photosynthesis have not been consistently observed in mature forests subject to chronic N deposition. In four mature northern hardwood forests in the north-central United States, chronic N additions (30 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1) as NaNO3 for 14 years) have increased aboveground growth but have not affected canopy leaf biomass or leaf area index. In order to understand the mechanism behind the increases in growth, we hypothesized that the NO3- additions increased foliar N concentrations and leaf-level photosynthesis in the dominant species in these forests (sugar maple, Acer saccharum). The NO3- additions significantly increased foliar N. However, there was no significant difference between the ambient and +NO3- treatments in two seasons (2006-2007) of instantaneous measurements of photosynthesis from either canopy towers or excised branches. In measurements on excised branches, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (mu mol CO2.s(-1).g(-1) N) was significantly decreased (-13\%) by NO3- additions. Furthermore, we found no consistent NO3- effect across all sites in either current foliage or leaf litter collected annually throughout the study (1993-2007) and analyzed for delta C-13 and delta O-18, isotopes that can be used together to integrate changes in photosynthesis over time. We observed a small but significant NO3- effect on the average area and mass of individual leaves from the excised branches, but these differences varied by site and were countered by changes in leaf number. These photosynthesis and leaf area data together suggest that NO3- additions have not stimulated photosynthesis. There is no evidence that nutrient deficiencies have developed at these sites, so unlike other studies of photosynthesis in N-saturated forests, we cannot attribute the lack of a stimulation of photosynthesis to nutrient limitations. Rather than increases in C assimilation, the observed increases in aboveground growth at our study sites are more likely due to shifts in C allocation.

AB  - A substantial portion of the carbon (C) fixed by the trees is allocated belowground to ectomycorrhizal (EM) symbionts, but this fraction usually declines after fertilization. The aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of optimal fertilization (including all the necessary nutrients) on the growth of EM fungi in young Norway spruce forests over a three year period. In addition, the amount of carbon sequestered by EM mycelia was estimated using a method based on the difference in delta C-13 between C-3 and C-4 plants. Sand-filled ingrowth mesh bags were used to estimate EM growth, and similar bags amended with compost made from maize leaves (a C-4 plant) were used to estimate C sequestration. Fertilizers had been applied either every year or every second year since 2002 and the estimates of EM growth started in 2007. The application of fertilizer reduced EM growth to between 0\% and 40\% of the growth in the control plots at one site (Ebbegarde), while no significant effect was found at the other three sites studied. The effect of the fertilizer was similar in sand-filled and maize-compost-amended mesh bags, but the total production of EM fungi was 3-4 times higher in maize-compost-amended mesh bags. The fertilizer tended to reduce EM growth more when applied every year than when applied every second year. The amount of C sequestered in maize-compost-amended mesh bags collected from unfertilized treatments was estimated to be between 0.2 and 0.7 mg C g sand(-1) at Ebbegarde and between 0.2 and 0.5 mg C g sand(-1) at Grangshammar. This corresponds to between 300 and 1100 kg C per ha, assuming a similar production in the soil as in the mesh bags. Fertilization at the Ebbegarde site reduced carbon sequestration, which confirmed the results based on estimates of fungal growth (ergosterol levels). A correlation was found between fungal biomass and delta C-13 in mesh bags amended with maize compost. Based on this, it was estimated that a fungal production of 1 mu g ergosterol corresponded to 0.33 mg of sequestered carbon. In conclusion, the effect of the fertilizer on EM growth seemed to be dependent on the effect of the fertilizer on tree growth. Thus, at Ebbegarde, were tree growth was less stimulated by the fertilizer, EM growth was reduced upon fertilization. At other sites, where tree growth was more stimulated, the fertilizer did not influence EM growth. The large amounts of carbon sequestered during the experiment may be a result of fungal residues remaining in the soil after the death of the hyphae. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plant litter decomposition is a critical ecosystem process representing a major pathway for carbon flux, but little is known about how it is affected by changes in plant composition and diversity. Single plant functional groups (graminoids, legumes, non-leguminous forbs) were removed from a grassland in northern Canada to examine the impacts of functional group identity on decomposition. Removals were conducted within two different environmental contexts (fertilization and fungicide application) to examine the context-dependency of these identity effects. We examined two different mechanisms by which the loss of plant functional groups may impact decomposition: effects of the living plant community on the decomposition microenvironment, and changes in the species composition of the decomposing litter, as well as the interaction between these mechanisms. We show that the identity of the plant functional group removed affects decomposition through both mechanisms. Removal of both graminoids and forbs slowed decomposition through changes in the decomposition microenvironment. We found non-additive effects of litter mixing, with both the direction and identity of the functional group responsible depending on year; in 2004 graminoids positively influenced decomposition whereas in 2006 forbs negatively influenced decomposition rate. Although these two mechanisms act independently, their effects may be additive if both mechanisms are considered simultaneously. It is essential to understand the variety of mechanisms through which even a single ecosystem property is affected if we are to predict the future consequences of biodiversity loss.

AB  - Temperature has generally great effects on both the activity and composition of microbial communities in different soils. We tested the impact of soil temperature and three different boreal forest tree species on the archaeal populations in the bulk soil, rhizosphere, and mycorrhizosphere. Scots pine, silver birch, and Norway spruce seedlings were grown in forest humus microcosms at three different temperatures, 7-11.5A degrees C (night-day temperature), 12-16A degrees C, and 16-22A degrees C, of which 12-16A degrees C represents the typical mid-summer soil temperature in Finnish forests. RNA and DNA were extracted from indigenous ectomycorrhiza, non-mycorrhizal long roots, and boreal forest humus and tested for the presence of archaea by nested PCR of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiling and sequencing. Methanogenic Euryarchaeota belonging to Methanolobus sp. and Methanosaeta sp. were detected on the roots and mycorrhiza. The most commonly detected archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences belonged to group I.1c Crenarchaeota, which are typically found in boreal and alpine forest soils. Interestingly, also one sequence belonging to group I.1b Crenarchaeota was detected from Scots pine mycorrhiza although sequences of this group are usually found in agricultural and forest soils in temperate areas. Tree- and temperature-related shifts in the archaeal population structure were observed. A clear decrease in crenarchaeotal DGGE band number was seen with increasing temperature, and correspondingly, the number of euryarchaeotal DGGE bands, mostly methanogens, increased. The greatest diversity of archaeal DGGE bands was detected in Scots pine roots and mycorrhizas. No archaea were detected from humus samples from microcosms without tree seedling, indicating that the archaea found in the mycorrhizosphere and root systems were dependent on the plant host. The detection of archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences from both RNA and DNA extractions show that the archaeal populations were living and that they may have significant contribution to the methane cycle in boreal forest soil, especially when soil temperatures rise.

AB  - Macrofungi from two old-growth prairie grove remnants in the Midwestern United States (Brownfield and Trelease Woods, Champaign Co., IL) were surveyed over two summer and fall fruiting periods. Communities of Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Myxomycetes were sampled and compared using multivariate statistical analyses. Standard estimations of species richness were calculated for comparison with other studies of fungal diversity. Environmental factors (rainfall, humidity, air temperature and soil temperature at 10 cm depth) as well as leaf litter composition, and woody plant communities were surveyed to assess their impact on fungal communities. Fungal community structure was found to differ significantly both between and within Brownfield and Trelease Woods. Communities of terrestrial macrofungi were determined to be strongly influenced by seasonality, with soil temperature at 10 cm depth showing the strongest correlation to changes in community composition. Brownfield and Trelease Woods, formerly part of a contiguous prairie grove with likely a single fungal community, are shown to have developed significantly different fungal communities over a period of separation of more than 120 y.

AB  - 1. The existence of many types of monodominant forests is readily explainable by ecological theory (e.g. early successional forests). Nevertheless, monodominant stands sometimes occur in areas where a much higher diversity typically occurs. Such `classical monodominance' is not currently readily explained by ecological theory. 2. We briefly review the published mechanisms suggested to cause classical monodominance and then combine them into a new probabilistic conceptual framework to better understand why these systems occur. We build on two theories proposed to explain monodominance: a lack of exogenous disturbance over long periods and species-specific life-history traits. We suggest that certain traits under certain conditions may generate positive feedbacks leading to a greater probability of monodominance being achieved. Such positive feedbacks have the potential to drive a typically diverse system towards a monodominant one. 3. Synthesis. Classical monodominance in tropical forests is hypothesized to be attained when a group of traits occur together under low exogenous disturbance conditions, this giving rise to a series of positive feedbacks. The presented framework links the differing mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain classical monodominance and shows there are potentially alternative routes to monodominance, thus reconciling apparently contradictory observational and experimental results.

AB  - A soil module was developed to improve on the ecosystem-scale simulations of forest models. The module includes simulations of bacteria, mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal fungi. The inclusion of these soil organisms allows for the simulation of several soil biological processes in a more mechanistic way. In this paper the soil module is used in combination with the forest model ANAFORE (ANAlysing Forest Ecosystems) a stand-scale forest model that simulates wood tissue development, carbon (C) and water (H(2)O) fluxes dynamically from physiological principles. Although the main purpose of this paper is the model description, a showcase run of the new soil model was performed using a Bayesian parameterization procedure for 16 forest sites (pedunculate oak, beech, Scots pine and poplar) on different soils in Belgium. Emphasis was on the soil organic horizons formation. The results show that one single parameter set could be used for the different forests in the study, and yielded reasonably close fits for most sites concerning pH and formation of the humus layer. Although running the Bayesian procedure to obtain good input parameter distributions was time-consuming (several months), runs using the developed parameter set are reasonably fast (days). These results are promising. However, the high uncertainty of both the input and the output of the model indicates that it is mainly useful as an experimental tool, rather than a predictive instrument. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The long-term effects of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and tropospheric O-3 concentrations on fungal communities in soil are not well understood. Here, we examine fungal community composition and the activities of cellobiohydrolase and N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) after 10 years of exposure to 1.5 times ambient levels of CO2 and O-3 in aspen and aspen-birch forest ecosystems, and compare these results to earlier studies in the same long-term experiment. The forest floor community was dominated by saprotrophic fungi, and differed slightly between plant community types, as did NAG activity. Elevated CO2 and O-3 had small but significant effects on the distribution of fungal genotypes in this horizon, and elevated CO2 also lead to an increase in the proportion of Sistotrema spp. within the community. Yet, although cellobiohydrolase activity was lower in the forest floor under elevated O-3, it was not affected by elevated CO2. NAG was also unaffected. The soil community was dominated by ectomycorrhizal species. Both CO2 and O-3 had a minor effect on the distribution of genotypes; however, phylogenetic analysis indicated that under elevated O-3 Cortinarius and Inocybe spp. increased in abundance and Laccaria and Tomentella spp. declined. Although cellobiohydrolase activity in soil was unaffected by either CO2 or O-3, NAG was higher (similar to 29\%) under CO2 in aspen-birch, but lower (similar to 18\%) under aspen. Time series analysis indicated that CO2 increased cellulolytic enzyme activity during the first 5 years of the experiment, but that the magnitude of this effect diminished over time. NAG activity also showed strong early stimulation by elevated CO2, but after 10 years this effect is no longer evident. Elevated O-3 appears to have variable stimulatory and repressive effects depending on the soil horizon and time point examined.

AB  - Coarse woody debris supports large numbers of saproxylic fungal species. However, most of the current knowledge comes from Scandinavia and studies relating the effect of stand or log characteristics on the diversity and composition of decomposer fungi have not been conducted in Northeastern Canada. Logs from five tree species were sampled along a decomposition gradient in nine stands representing three successional stages of the boreal mixed forest of Northwestern Quebec, Canada. Using a molecular fingerprinting technique, we assessed fungal community Shannon-Weaver diversity index, richness, and composition. We used linear mixed models and multivariate analyses to link changes in fungal communities to log and stand characteristics. We found a total of 33 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) including an indicator species for balsam fir (similar to Athelia sp.) and one found only in aspen stands (similar to Calocera cornea). Spruce logs supported the highest fungal Shannon-Weaver diversity index and OTU number. Our results support the hypothesis that log species influences fungal richness and diversity. However, log decay class does not. Stand composition, volume of coarse woody debris, and log chemical composition were all involved in structuring fungal communities. Maintaining the diversity of wood-decomposing communities therefore requires the presence of dead wood from diverse log species.

AB  - P>Understanding the factors that drive soil carbon (C) accumulation is of fundamental importance given their potential to mitigate climate change. Much research has focused on the relationship between plant traits and C sequestration, but no studies to date have quantitatively considered traits of their mycorrhizal symbionts. Here, we use a modelling approach to assess the contribution of an important mycorrhizal fungal trait, organic nutrient uptake, to soil C accumulation. We show that organic nutrient uptake can significantly increase soil C storage, and that it has a greater effect under nutrient-limited conditions. The main mechanism behind this was an increase in plant C fixation and subsequent increased C inputs to soil through mycorrhizal fungi. Reduced decomposition due to increased nutrient limitation of saprotrophs also played a role. Our results indicate that direct uptake of nutrients from organic pools by mycorrhizal fungi could have a significant effect on ecosystem C cycling and storage.

AB  - Knowledge is limited about whether root nutrient concentrations are affected by mixtures of tree species and interspecific root competition. The goal of this field study was to investigate root nutrient element concentrations in relation to root and ectomycorrhizal (EM) diversity in six different mixtures of beech (Fagus sylvatica), ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and lime (Tilia sp.) in an old-growth, undisturbed forest ecosystem. Root biomass and nutrient concentrations per tree taxon as well as the abundance and identity of all EM fungi were determined in soil cores of a volume of 1 L (r = 40 mm, depth = 200 mm). Stand-level nutrient concentrations in overall root biomass and H' (Shannon-Wiener diversity) were obtained by pooling the data per stand. At stand level, Shannon H' for roots and aboveground tree species abundance were correlated. H' for roots and EM fungi were not correlated because of the contribution of ash roots that form only arbuscular mycorrhizal but no EM associations. Nutrient element concentrations in roots showed taxon-related differences and increased in the following order: beech <= lime < ash with the exception of calcium (Ca), which was lower in ash. Stand-level concentrations of Ca, magnesium, potassium and sulfur in roots increased with increasing tree diversity because of two effects: increasing contribution of ash roots to the mixture and increasing Ca accumulation in beech roots with increasing root diversity. On a small scale, increasing root diversity, but not EM diversity, was correlated with decreasing P concentrations in beech roots pointing to interspecific tree competition. Nitrogen (N) concentrations of beech roots were unaltered in relation to root and EM diversity. Opposing behavior was observed for lime and ash: the N concentrations in lime roots increased, whereas those in ash roots decreased with increasing EM diversity in a given soil volume. This suggests that EM diversity facilitates N acquisition of lime roots at the expense of non-EM ash.

AB  - In all terrestrial ecosystems, testate amoebae (TA) encounter fungi. There are strong indications that both groups engage in multiple interactions, including mycophagy and decomposition of TA shells, processes which might be fundamental in nutrient cycling in certain ecosystems. Here, we present the results of an experiment focusing on interactions between TA and saprotrophic microfungi colonizing Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) litter needles. The needles were collected from a temperate pine forest and cultivated in damp chambers. Over a few weeks, melanized mycelium of Anavirga laxa Sutton started to grow out of some needles; simultaneously, the common forest-soil TA Phryganella acropodia (Hertwig and Lesser) Hopkinson reproduced and spread around the mycelium. We investigated whether a potential relationship between TA and saprotrophic microfungi exists by comparing the composition of TA communities on and around the needles and testing the spatial relationship between the A. laxa mycelium and P. acropodia shells in the experimental microcosm. Additionally, we asked whether P. acropodia utilized the A. laxa mycelium as a nutrient source and screened whether P. acropodia shells were colonized by the microfungi inhabiting the experimental microcosm. Our results indicate that saprotrophic microfungi may affect the composition of TA communities and their mycelium may affect distribution of TA individuals in pine litter. Our observations suggest that P. acropodia did not graze directly on A. laxa mycelium, but rather fed on its exudates or bacteria associated with the exudates. The fungus Pochonia bulbillosa (Gams \& Malla) Zare \& Gams was often found parasitising encysted shells or decomposing already dead individuals of P. acropodia. TA and pine litter microfungi engage in various direct and indirect interactions which are still poorly understood and deserve further investigation. Their elucidation will improve our knowledge on fundamental processes influencing coexistence of soil microflora and microfauna.

AB  - Little is known about the community dynamics of fungi on decomposing fine roots, despite the importance of fine roots as a source of carbon to detrital systems in forests. We examined fungal communities on dead roots in a sugar-maple dominated northern hardwood forest to test the hypothesis that community development is sensitive to rhizosphere disruption. We generated cohorts of dead fine roots in root windows and disturbed the rhizosphere microbial community in half of the windows by moving roots into sieved bulk soil. We sampled root fragments repeatedly over time and cultured fungi from these fragments to explore temporal patterns of fungal species composition. Disturbing the root rhizosphere prior to initiating decomposition changed the dominant fungal taxa, the distribution of dominant species within the community, and the temporal development in the culturable fungal community. Dominance in control roots shifted from Neonectria in early decay to Umbelopsis in later decay. Disturbance roots were more evenly dominated over time by Trichoderma, Neonectria, another species of Umbelopsis, and Pochonia. Our results suggest that species interactions are important in the ecology of fine root decay fungi, with the rhizosphere community of the living root influencing development of the decay community.

AB  - P>The earth's future climate state is highly dependent upon changes in terrestrial C storage in response to rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2. Here we show that consistently enhanced rates of net primary production (NPP) are sustained by a C-cascade through the root-microbe-soil system; increases in the flux of C belowground under elevated CO2 stimulated microbial activity, accelerated the rate of soil organic matter decomposition and stimulated tree uptake of N bound to this SOM. This process set into motion a positive feedback maintaining greater C gain under elevated CO2 as a result of increases in canopy N content and higher photosynthetic N-use efficiency. The ecosystem-level consequence of the enhanced requirement for N and the exchange of plant C for N belowground is the dominance of C storage in tree biomass but the preclusion of a large C sink in the soil.

AB  - Soil fungi are highly diverse and act as the primary agents of nutrient cycling in forests. These fungal communities are often dominated by mycorrhizal fungi that form mutually beneficial relationships with plant roots and some mycorrhizal fungi produce extracellular and cell-bound enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of nitrogen (N)- and phosphorus (P)- containing compounds in soil organic matter. Here we investigated whether the community structure of different types of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi) is correlated with soil chemistry and enzyme activity in a northern hardwood forest and whether these correlations change over the growing season. We quantified these relationships in an experimental paired plot study where white-tailed deer (access or excluded 4.5 yrs) treatment was crossed with garlic mustard (presence or removal 1 yr). We collected soil samples early and late in the growing season and analyzed them for soil chemistry, extracellular enzyme activity and molecular analysis of both arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal/saprotrophic fungal communities using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP). AM fungal communities did not change seasonally but were positively correlated with the activities of urease and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), enzymes involved in N cycling. The density of garlic mustard was correlated with the presence of specific AM fungal species, while deer exclusion or access had no effect on either fungal community after 4.5 yrs. Ectomycorrhizal/saprotrophic fungal communities changed seasonally and were positively correlated with most soil enzymes, including enzymes involved in carbon (C), N and P cycling, but only during late summer sampling. Our results suggest that fine scale temporal and spatial changes in soil fungal communities may affect soil nutrient and carbon cycling. Although AM fungi are not generally considered capable of producing extracellular enzymes, the correlation between some AM taxa and the activity of N acquisition enzymes suggests that these fungi may play a role in forest understory N cycling.

AB  - A large remaining of dry deciduous forest (woody Caatinga) in semi-arid Brazil has been reached by successive fires and exploratory actions what leads to the invasion of low load trees and shrub mesh, called ``Carrasco vegetation{''}. As it restrains the sprouting of woody species, land recuperation was performed using a mixed plantation of native and Eucalyptus species to both preservation and to supply the demand for wood. In order to evaluate the recuperation, a study of microbial communities was proposed. In addition to the highest soil phosphorus content found in the Carrasco area, the greatest spore density of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities occurred in the rhizosphere of the both pioneer species: Carrasco and Eucalyptus. In contrast to the DGGE bacteria profile, it was possible to group AMF species of the preserved and experimental sites which were not clustered with Carrasco species through the DGGE of Glomales DNA and also by the principal component analysis (PCA) based on diversity index. Glomus and Acaulospora were the dominant genera at both the preserved site and Carrasco. Nevertheless, Gigaspora species were preferentially found in Dry Forest, while Scutellospora were absent. In contrast, Carrasco favoured the genus Scutellospora and the species Acaulospora scrobiculata. Our results allow one to conclude that vegetation type modifies the AMF communities, which may be used as good indicator of soil quality. Based on AMF communities as soil quality indicator, the mixed forest plantation appears to be underway towards the preserved site two years after transplantation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microbial communities and their associated enzyme activities affect the amount and chemical quality of carbon (C) in soils. Increasing nitrogen (N) deposition, particularly in N-rich tropical forests, is likely to change the composition and behavior of microbial communities and feed back on ecosystem structure and function. This study presents a novel assessment of mechanistic links between microbial responses to N deposition and shifts in soil organic matter (SOM) quality and quantity. We used phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and microbial enzyme assays in soils to assess microbial community responses to long-term N additions in two distinct tropical rain forests. We used soil density fractionation and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to measure related changes in SOM pool sizes and chemical quality. Microbial biomass increased in response to N fertilization in both tropical forests and corresponded to declines in pools of low-density SOM. The chemical quality of this soil C pool reflected ecosystem-specific changes in microbial community composition. In the lower-elevation forest, there was an increase in gram-negative bacteria PLFA biomass, and there were significant losses of labile C chemical groups (O-alkyls). In contrast, the upper-elevation tropical forest had an increase in fungal PLFAs with N additions and declines in C groups associated with increased soil C storage (alkyls). The dynamics of microbial enzymatic activities with N addition provided a functional link between changes in microbial community structure and SOM chemistry. Ecosystem-specific changes in microbial community composition are likely to have far-reaching effects on soil carbon storage and cycling. This study indicates that microbial communities in N-rich tropical forests can be sensitive to added N, but we can expect significant variability in how ecosystem structure and function respond to N deposition among tropical forest types.

AB  - Measurements of concentrations of easily extractable soil nitrogen (N) were carried out on samples collected at the Heron Wood Reserve, Scotland, concurrently with investigations of N associated with total microbial biomass and the abundances of bacteria, fungi, and invertebrates. Soil biota at the studied site appeared to be limited by N. There was a remarkable difference between the ambient (i.e., easily extractable N) and biomass nitrogen. The abundance data of bacteria, protozoa and nematodes significantly negatively correlated with ambient N but showed positive correlations with the total microbial N content. There were, however, remarkable differences between the correlation patterns exhibited by the fungal and the bacterial pathways, as fungi did not show any correlations with chemical variables. These differences should be taken into account whilst interpreting biological interactions both at this important site and elsewhere.

AB  - Root turnover is fastest in the finest roots of the root system (first root order). Additionally, tissue chemistry varies among even the finest root orders and between white roots and older, pigmented roots. Yet the effects of pigmentation and order on root decomposition have rarely been examined. We separated the first four root orders (all,1 mm) of four temperate tree species into three classes: white first- and second-order roots; pigmented first- and second-order roots; and pigmented third-and fourth-order roots. Roots were enclosed in litterbags and buried under their own and under a common species canopy in a 34-year-old common garden in Poland. When comparing decomposition of different root orders over 36 months, pigmented third-and fourth-order roots with a higher C:N ratio decomposed more rapidly, losing 20-40\% of their mass, than pigmented first- and second-order roots, which lost no more than 20\%. When comparing decomposition of roots of different levels of pigmentation within the same root order over 14 months, pigmented (older) first- and second-order roots lost; 10\% of their mass, while white (younger) first- and second-order roots lost; 30\%. In contrast to root mass loss, root N content declined more rapidly in the first- and second-order roots than in third-and fourth-order roots. In higher-order roots, N increased in the first 10 months from; 110\% to nearly 150\% of initial N content, depending on species; by the end of the study N content had returned to initial levels. These findings suggest that, in plant communities where root mortality is primarily of pigmented first- and second-order roots, microbial decomposition may be slower than estimates derived from bulk fine-root litterbag experiments, which typically contain at least four root orders. Thus, a more mechanistic understanding of root decomposition and its contribution to ecosystem carbon and nutrient dynamics requires a fundamental shift in experimental methods that stratifies root samples for decomposition along more functionally based criteria such as root order and pigmentation, which parallel the markedly different longevities of these different root classes.

AB  - Climate changes will influence soil organisms both directly (warming) and indirectly (warming and elevated CO2) via changes in quantity and quality of plant-mediated soil C inputs. Elevated atmospheric CO2 commonly stimulates flow of organic C into the soil system, increases root production and exudation, but decreases litter quality. There is little evidence that atmospheric CO2 enrichment will increase total soil organic matter content because greater C flow into soil stimulates the soil food web, often leading to equivalent increases in soil CO2 efflux. Effects of warming on C allocation belowground, on the other hand, will depend largely on the temperature optima of different plant species. Warming is likely to increase the rate of soil organic matter decomposition by stimulating soil heterotrophic respiration, although some degree of acclimatization to warming is likely. Mycorrhizal and N-2-fixing relationships are generally enhanced by CO2 enrichment, but effects of warming are highly variable. Data suggest that energy flow through fungal pathways may be enhanced relative to bacterial pathways by both warming and atmospheric CO2 enrichment. Whether the shift toward fungal domination of soils will increase soilborne fungal disease occurrence in the future is still an open question. Plant heat and drought tolerance, along with resistance to pathogens in warmer and wetter soils, may be achieved, to some unknown extent, by exploitation and management of beneficial soil organisms. Further study is needed to develop a more holistic understanding of the effects of climate change on belowground processes.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of plant community characteristics on soil carbon dioxide efflux (R) is a key prerequisite for accurate prediction of the future carbon (C) balance of terrestrial ecosystems under climate change. However, developing a mechanistic understanding of the determinants of R is complicated by the presence of multiple different sources of respiratory C within soil - such as soil microbes, plant roots and their mycorrhizal symbionts - each with their distinct dynamics and drivers. In this review, we synthesize relevant information from a wide spectrum of sources to evaluate the current state of knowledge about plant community effects on R, examine how this information is incorporated into global climate models, and highlight priorities for future research. Despite often large variation amongst studies and methods, several general trends emerge. Mechanisms whereby plants affect R may be grouped into effects on belowground C allocation, aboveground litter properties and microclimate. Within vegetation types, the amount of C diverted belowground, and hence R, may be controlled mainly by the rate of photosynthetic C uptake, while amongst vegetation types this should be more dependent upon the specific C allocation strategies of the plant life form. We make the case that plant community composition, rather than diversity, is usually the dominant control on R in natural systems. Individual species impacts on R may be largest where the species accounts for most of the biomass in the ecosystem, has very distinct traits to the rest of the community and/or modulates the occurrence of major natural disturbances. We show that climate vegetation models incorporate a number of pathways whereby plants can affect R, but that simplifications regarding allocation schemes and drivers of litter decomposition may limit model accuracy. We also suggest that under a warmer future climate, many plant communities may shift towards dominance by fast growing plants which produce large quantities of nutrient rich litter. Where this community shift occurs, it could drive an increase in R beyond that expected from direct climate impacts on soil microbial activity alone. We identify key gaps in knowledge and recommend them as priorities for future work. These include the patterns of photosynthate partitioning amongst belowground components, ecosystem level effects of individual plant traits, and the importance of trophic interactions and species invasions or extinctions for ecosystem processes. A final, overarching challenge is how to link these observations and drivers across spatio-temporal scales to predict regional or global changes in R over long time periods. A more unified approach to understanding R, which integrates information about plant traits and community dynamics, will be essential for better understanding, simulating and predicting patterns of R across terrestrial ecosystems and its role within the earth-climate system.

AB  - The significance of mycorrhizas (fungal roots in 90\% of land plants) in plant nutrient acquisition and growth, element biogeochemical cycling and maintaining of terrestrial ecosystem structures has been globally established for more than 120 years. Great progress in mycorrhizal research in the past 60 years (1950-2009, 1981-2009 in particular) has also been made across China, particularly in the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. For instance, a total of 20 new and similar to 120 records of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal species, 30 new and similar to 800 records of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal species, a dozen of new and similar to 100 records of orchid mycorrhizal (OM) fungal species have been isolated by morphological observation and/or molecular identification in China since the 1950s. Great accomplishment has also been made in the following area, including fungal species richness and genetic structure, relationships between species composition and plant taxa, effects of mycorrhizal fungi on plant nutrient uptake and growth, resistances to pathogens and interactions with other soil microorganisms, potential of mycorrhizal fungi in phytoremediation and/or land reclamation, alterations of enzymatic activities in mycorrhizal plants, and elevated CO2 and O-3 on root colonization and species diversity. Unfortunately, the international community cannot easily appreciate almost all Chinese mycorrhizal studies since the vast majority of them have been published in Chinese and/or in China-based journals. The aim of this review is to make a comprehensive exposure of the past and present China's major mycorrhizal research to the whole world, and then to suggest potential directions for the enhancement of future mycorrhizal research within and/or between the Chinese and international mycorrhizal community.

AB  - The role of plant diversity in supporting fungal diversity is well established, but the possible effects of plant diversity in creating that diversity have received less attention. We investigated sporocarp phenology in replicated, planted 20 x 20 m plots of 14 different tree species, to test whether tree species identity caused phenological shifts in fungal reproduction, providing a potential mechanism for allochrony. Tree species identity was a significant determinant of sporocarp phenology for the two most abundant fungal species, and for four common fungal genera. The results support the suggestion that plant host can drive fungal phenology and may provide a potential mechanism for allochronous speciation.

AB  - Losses of species and changes in the composition of plant communities are likely to influence numerous ecosystem functions. Changes in the plant-soil interactions that control decomposition, in particular, could alter carbon and nutrient cycling in soils and further alter other ecosystem functions. The effects of plant communities on decomposition may depend both on the type of tissue being decomposed and also on the different stages of the decomposition process. We used an experimental design where single plant functional groups were removed from a northern grassland to examine the role of plant identity in determining both short-term and long-term above- and belowground decomposition rates. Plant removals were conducted across fertilization and fungicide treatments to examine environmental context-dependency of functional group identity effects on decomposition. There were significant effects of plant functional group identity on aboveground decomposition, with the loss of grasses and forbs slowing decomposition, whereas the effects on belowground decomposition were rare and transient. Effects of plant identity on decomposition were consistent in both short- and long-term decomposition studies indicating that the influences of identity on the decomposition environment remained consistent throughout the different stages of the decomposition process. Both fertilizer and fungicide treatments affected overall decomposition rate, but there were few interactions between these treatments and plant removals. Although current species loss is likely to be happening in concert with environmental changes, the role a species plays in determining ecosystem functions such as decomposition may not be context-dependent in these northern environments, and this may provide greater predictive power in determining the effects of species loss with changing environments. Further, as plant identity shows significant effects on litter decomposition rates, the effects of current and predicted future biodiversity losses may depend specifically on which species are lost.

AB  - In this study, we describe the seasonal variation in (15)N abundance in the litter of two Sphagnum species and four vascular plant species during 3 years of field decomposition in an Italian Alpine bog. Litter bags were periodically retrieved at the end of summer and winter periods, and the delta(15)N in residual litter was related to mass loss, litter chemistry, and climatic conditions. In Sphagnum litter, higher rates of decomposition during summer months were associated with an increase of delta(15)N probably due to the incorporation of microbial organic compounds rich in (15)N. The litter of Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex rostrata was characterized by a decrease of delta(15)N, so that the final signature was significantly lower than in initial litter. On the other hand, the residual litter of Potentilla erecta and Calluna vulgaris was characterized by a final delta(15)N higher than in initial litter. Our data reported a seasonality of (15)N abundance in the residual litter of Sphagnum species, but not in that of vascular plant species, thus highlighting the role of differences in litter chemistry.

AB  - Communities of archaea, bacteria, and fungi were examined in forest soils located in the Oregon Coast Range and the inland Cascade Mountains. Soils from replicated plots of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and red alder (Alnus rubra) were characterized using fungal ITS (internal transcribed spacer region), eubacterial 16S rRNA, and archaeal 16S rRNA primers. Population size was measured with quantitative (Q)-PCR and composition was examined using length heterogeneity (LH)-PCR for fungal composition, terminal restriction fragment length (T-RFLP) profiles for bacterial and archaeal composition, and sequencing to identify dominant community members. Whereas fungal and archaeal composition varied between sites and dominant tree species, bacterial communities only varied between sites. The abundance of archaeal gene copy numbers was found to be greater in coastal compared to montane soils accounting for 11\% of the prokaryotic community. Crenarchaea groups 1.1a-associated, 1.1b, 1.1c, and 1.1c-associated were putatively identified. A greater abundance of Crenarchaea 1.1b indicator fragments was found in acidic (pH 4) soils with low C:N ratios under red alder. In coastal soils, 25\% of fungal sequences were putatively identified as basidiomycetous yeasts belonging to the genus Cryptococcus. Although the function of these yeasts in soil is not known, they could significantly contribute to decomposition processes in coastal soils distinguished by rapid tree growth, high N content, low pH, and frequent water-saturation events.

AB  - Boreal forests store a large fraction of global terrestrial carbon and are susceptible to environmental change, particularly rising temperatures and increased fire frequency. These changes have the potential to drive positive feedbacks between climate warming and the boreal carbon cycle. Because few studies have examined the warming response of boreal ecosystems recovering from fire, we established a greenhouse warming experiment near Delta Junction, Alaska, seven years after a 1999 wildfire. We hypothesized that experimental warming would increase soil CO2 efflux, stimulate nutrient mineralization, and alter the composition and function of soil fungal communities. Although our treatment resulted in 1.20 degrees C soil warming, we found little support for our hypothesis. Only the activities of cellulose- and chitin-degrading enzymes increased significantly by 15\% and 35\%, respectively, and there were no changes in soil fungal communities. Warming resulted in drier soils, but the corresponding change in soil water potential was probably not sufficient to limit microbial activity. Rather, the warming response of this soil may be constrained by depletion of labile carbon substrates resulting from combustion and elevated soil temperatures in the years after the 1999 fire. We conclude that positive feedbacks between warming and the microbial release of soil carbon are weak in boreal ecosystems lacking permafrost. Since permafrost-free soils underlie 45-60\% of the boreal zone, our results should be useful for modeling the warming response during recovery from fire in a large fraction of the boreal forest.

AB  - Soils emit a large variety of volatile organic compounds. In natural ecosystems, measurements of microbial volatile organic compound (MVOC) exchange rates between soil and atmosphere are difficult due to e.g. the spatial heterogeneity of the belowground organisms, and due to the many potential sources for the same compounds. We measured in laboratory conditions the MVOC emission rates and spectra of eight typical fungi occurring in boreal forest soils. The studied species are decomposers (Gymnopilus penetrans, Ophiostoma abietinum), ectomycorrhizal (Cenococcum geophilum, Piloderma olivaceum, Suillus variegatus, Tomentellopsis submollis) and endophytic fungi (Meliniomyces variabilis, Phialocephala fortinii). The MVOC emissions contained altogether 21 known and 6 unidentified compounds whose emission rates were >0.1 mu g g(DW)(-1) h(-1). The most abundant compounds were the short-chain carbonyl compounds (acetone and acetaldehyde). The greatest carbonyl emissions were measured from P. olivaceum (1.9 mg acetone g (DW)(-1) h(-1)) and P. fortinii (0.114 mg acetaldehyde g(DW)(-1) h(-1)). Terpenoid emissions (isoprene, mono- and sesquiterpenes) were detected from some fungal cultures, but in relatively small amounts. We conclude that soil micro-organisms can potentially be responsible for significant emissions of volatiles, especially short-chain oxygenated compounds, to the below-canopy atmosphere.

AB  - Global environmental change has serious implications for functional biodiversity in temperate and boreal forests. Trees depend on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, but predicted increases in nitrogen availability may alter fungal communities. To address a knowledge gap regarding the effects of nitrogen availability on mycorrhizal communities at large scales, we examine the relationship between nitrogen and ectomycorrhizas in part of a European biomonitoring network of pine forest plots. Our analyses show that increased nitrogen reduces fungal diversity and causes shifts in mycorrhizal community composition across plots, but we do not find strong evidence that within-plot differences in nitrogen availability affect ectomycorrhizal communities. We also carry out exploratory analyses to determine the relative importance of other environmental variables in structuring mycorrhizal communities, and discuss the potential use of indicator species to predict nitrogen-induced shifts in fungal communities.

AB  - Rising atmospheric CO2 concentration will affect belowground processes and forest function. However, the direction and magnitude of change for many soil processes are unknown. We used minirhizotrons to observe fine root and fungal dynamics in response to elevated CO2 in a model regenerating longleaf pine community in open-top chambers. The model community consisted of five plant species common to xeric sandhills longleaf pine stands: Pinus palustris, Quercus margaretta, Aristida stricta, Crotalaria rotundifolia, and Asclepias tuberosa. Elevated CO2 significantly increased both fine root and mycorrhizal tip standing crop by more than 50\% in the deeper soil horizon (17-34 cm). Rhizomorph standing crop was nearly doubled in both deep and shallow soil (P = 0.04). Survivorship results for fine roots and rhizomorphs varied between soil depths. Fine root survivorship was likely influenced more by changes in community composition and species interactions driven by elevated CO2 rather than by direct effects of elevated CO2 on the fine roots of individual species. In this system, it appears that elevated CO2 led to a greater reliance on fungal symbionts to meet additional nutrient requirements rather than substantially increased root growth.

AB  - We used 454 sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region to characterize fungal communities in tallgrass prairie soils subdivided into strata 0-10, 10-20, 30-40 and 50-60 cm deep. The dataset included more than 14 000 fungal sequences distributed across Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, basal fungal lineages and Glomeromycota in order of decreasing frequency. As expected the community richness and diversity estimators tended to decrease with increasing depth. Although species richness was significantly reduced for samples from the deeper profiles, even the deepest stratum sampled contained richness of more than a third of that in the topmost stratum. More importantly, nonparametric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination analyses indicated that the fungal communities differed across vertical profiles, although only the topmost and deepest strata were significantly different when the NMS axis scores were compared by ANOVA. These results emphasize the importance of considering the fungal communities across the vertical strata because the deeper soil horizons might maintain a distinct community composition and thus contribute greatly to overall richness. The majority of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) declined in frequency with increasing depth, although a linear regression analysis indicated that some increased with increasing depth. The OTUs and BLAST-assigned taxa that showed increasing frequencies were mainly unculturable fungi, but some showed likely affinities to families Nectriaceae and Venturiaceae or to genus Pachnocybe. Although the ecological roles of the fungi in the deeper strata remain uncertain, we hypothesize that the fungi with preferences for deeper soil have adequate access to substrates and possess environmental tolerances that enable their persistence in those environments.

AB  - Dense hyphal mats formed by ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi are prominent features in Douglas-fir forest ecosystems, and have been estimated to cover up to 40\% of the soil surface in some forest stands. Two morphotypes of EcM mats have been previously described: rhizomorphic mats, which have thick hyphal rhizomorphs and are found primarily in the organic horizon, and hydrophobic mats, which occur in the mineral horizon and have an ashy appearance. This study surveyed EcM mat and non-mat soils from eight early and late seral conifer forest stands at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in western Oregon. EcM mats were classified by morphology and taxonomic identities were determined by DNA sequencing. A variety of chemical and biochemical properties, including enzymes involved in C, N, and P cycling were measured. Analysis was confined to a comparison of rhizomorphic mats colonizing the organic horizon with non-mat organic soils, and hydrophobic mats with non-mat mineral soils. Both the organic and mineral horizons showed differences between mat and non-mat enzyme profiles when compared on a dry weight basis. In the organic horizon, rhizomorphic mats had greater chitinase activity than non-mat soils: and in the mineral horizon, hydrophobic mats had increased chitinase, phosphatase, and phenoloxidase activity compared to the non-mat soil. The rhizomorphic mats had 2.7 times more oxalate than the non-mats and significantly lower pH. In the mineral horizon, hydrophobic mats had 40 times more oxalate and significantly lower pH than non-mat mineral soils. Microbial biomass C was not significantly different between the rhizomorphic mat and non-mat organic soils. In the mineral horizon, however, the hydrophobic mats had greater microbial biomass C than the non-mat soils. These data demonstrate that soils densely colonized by EcM fungi create a unique soil environment with distinct microbial activities when compared to non-mat forest soils. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We used minirhizotrons to examine the production and turnover of fungal hyphae in situ during the dry season in a Californian grassland. Hyphae were produced relatively slowly throughout the season at rates that did not vary significantly over time, indicating that a portion of the fungal community was active even when soils were very dry. In addition, fungi displayed relatively long residence times, with half of the hyphae remaining in the soil for at least 145 days. Together, these results suggest that a contingent of active fungi may be capable of performing nutrient transformations when plants are otherwise dormant, while relatively long-lasting hyphae may immobilize nutrients for several months before turning over.

AB  - Mangrove forests dominate the world's tropical and subtropical coastlines. Similar to other plant communities, nutrient availability is one of the major factors influencing mangrove forest structure and productivity. Many mangrove soils have extremely low nutrient availability, although nutrient availability can vary greatly among and within mangrove forests. Nutrient-conserving processes in mangroves are well developed and include evergreeness, resorption of nutrients prior to leaf fall, the immobilization of nutrients in leaf litter during decomposition, high root/shoot ratios and the repeated use of old root channels. Both nitrogen-use efficiency and nutrient resorption efficiencies in mangroves are amongst the highest recorded for angiosperms. A complex range of interacting abiotic and biotic factors controls the availability of nutrients to mangrove trees, and mangroves are characteristically plastic in their ability to opportunistically utilize nutrients when these become available. Nitrogen and phosphorus have been implicated as the nutrients most likely to limit growth in mangroves. Ammonium is the primary form of nitrogen in mangrove soils, in part as a result of anoxic soil conditions, and tree growth is supported mainly by ammonium uptake. Nutrient enrichment is a major threat to marine ecosystems. Although mangroves have been proposed to protect the marine environment from land-derived nutrient pollution, nutrient enrichment can have negative consequences for mangrove forests and their capacity for retention of nutrients may be limited.

AB  - The interactions among different components of detrital food webs are likely to influence carbon processing and linkages between C and nutrient cycling. Our objective was to identify potentially important interactions in detrital food webs at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, USA, by exploring relationships among C resources, microbial biomass, microarthropod abundance and nitrogen availability as they vary across the landscape. We found significant spatial variation in microarthropod abundance in the forest floor across elevation zones in two watersheds, with consistently higher abundance in low-elevation hardwoods and upper conifer zones and lower abundance in mid- and high-elevation hardwoods. The same pattern was observed in the Oe horizon for microbial biomass C and respiration but not for N transformations; however, no patterns were observed in the Oa horizon. Microarthropod abundance and microbial biomass C were significantly positively correlated, but neither were related to forest floor mass or to annual aboveground fine litterfall flux. Instead, a positive correlation with fine root biomass suggests that C supply from roots plays a key role in the fungal channel of the detrital food web of these forests. The lack of relationship between patterns of microarthropod abundance and net N mineralization leads us to hypothesize that spatial patterns of nitrogen availability are not closely linked to variation in carbon flow through the detrital food web, within this forested landscape. In contrast, microarthropod abundance and net N mineralization did exhibit similar interannual variation and may respond to the same temporal controls. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) have been used for more than two decades in analyses of food web structure. The utility of isotope ratio measurements is based on the observation that consumer delta C-13 values are similar (< 1aEuro degrees difference) to those of their diet, while consumer delta N-15 values are about 3aEuro degrees higher than those of their diet. The technique has been applied most often to aquatic and aboveground terrestrial food webs. However, few isotope studies have examined terrestrial food web structure that includes both above- and belowground (detrital) components. Here, we review factors that may influence isotopic signatures of terrestrial consumers in above- and belowground systems. In particular, we emphasize variations in delta C-13 and delta N-15 in belowground systems, e.g., enrichment of C-13 and N-15 in soil organic matter (likely related to soil microbial metabolism). These enrichments should be associated with the high C-13 (similar to 3aEuro degrees) enrichment in belowground consumers relative to litter and soil organic matter and with the large variation in delta N-15 (similar to 6aEuro degrees) of the consumers. Because such enrichment and variation are much greater than the trophic enrichment generally used to estimate consumer trophic positions, and because many general predators are considered dependent on energy and material flows from belowground, the isotopic variation in belowground systems should be taken into account in delta C-13 and delta N-15 analyses of terrestrial food webs. Meanwhile, by measuring the delta C-13 of key predators, the linkage between above- and belowground systems could be estimated based on observed differences in delta C-13 of primary producers, detritivores and predators. Furthermore, radiocarbon (C-14) measurements will allow the direct estimation of the dependence of predators on the belowground systems.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi dominate the humus layers of boreal forests. They depend on carbohydrates that are translocated through roots, via fungal mycelium to microsites in the soil, wherein they forage for nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi are therefore sensitive to disruptive disturbances that may restrict their carbon supply. By disrupting root connections, we induced a sudden decline in mycorrhizal mycelial abundance and studied the consequent effects on growth and activity of free living, saprotrophic fungi and bacteria in pine forest humus, using molecular community analyses in combination with enzyme activity measurements. Ectomycorrhizal fungi had decreased in abundance 14 days after root severing, but the abundance of certain free-living ascomycetes was three times higher within 5 days of the disturbance compared with undisturbed controls. Root disruption also increased laccase production by an order of magnitude and cellulase production by a factor of 5. In contrast, bacterial populations seemed little affected. The results indicate that access to an external carbon source enables mycorrhizal fungi to monopolise the humus, but disturbances may induce rapid growth of opportunistic saprotrophic fungi that presumably use the dying mycorrhizal mycelium. Studies of such functional shifts in fungal communities, induced by disturbance, may shed light on mechanisms behind nutrient retention and release in boreal forests. The results also highlight the fundamental problems associated with methods that study microbial processes in soil samples that have been isolated from living roots.

AB  - Fine root (< 2 mm) decomposition provides a substantial amount of available nitrogen (N) that sustains plant growth. The N release pattern during litter decomposition is generally controlled by initial N concentrations or C/N. Because root branch order and mycorrhizal colonization (related with branch order) are both highly related with different initial chemistry, a hypothesis was proposed that N dynamics during root decomposition varied among different branch orders. Using the litterbag method, decomposition of the first six order roots for Fraxinus mandshurica (an arbuscular mycorrhizal species) and Larix gmelinii (an ectomycorrhizal species) was studied in Northeast China during a 513-day period. Results showed a similar pattern for the two species with contrasting mycorrhizal type: lower-order roots (the lateral root tips), which had an initial C/N of 17-21, continuously released N without any immobilization and maintained a consistently low C/N (< 20), whereas higher-order roots, which had an initial C/N of 28-48, periodically immobilized N, leading to a declining C/N over time. In addition, the magnitude of N dynamics is different between species for lower-order roots, but no different for higher-order roots. These results suggest that fine root N dynamics are heterogeneous among branch orders and that species-specific differences depend on the behavior of lower-order roots.

AB  - We investigated the role of tetrapartite associations between an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus (Glomus geosporum), phosphate solubilizing bacteria (Paenibacillus polymyxa), Frankia and Casuarina equisetifolia on growth, nutrient acquisition, nutrient utilization and seedling quality of C. equisetifolia. Seedlings of C. equisetifolia were grown in an Alfisol soil and inoculated with G. geosporum, P. polymyxa and Frankia either individually or in combinations. Inoculation of bioinoculants stimulated seedling growth, the efficiency of nutrient uptake and improved seedling quality. However, microbial inoculation generally reduced the efficiency of nutrient utilization in dry matter production (nutrient use efficiency). Inoculation of P. polymyxa or Frankia increased the extent of AM colonization, which resulted in the accumulation of the nutrients. Seedlings inoculated with Frankia and G. geosporum had more, and heavier nodules compared to seedlings inoculated with Frankia alone. Dual inoculation of microbes was more effective than individual inoculations. The growth response of seedlings to inoculation involving all the microbes was greater than the response to either individual or dual inoculations. The results of this study showed that the tetrapartite association could improve the growth, nutrient acquisition and seedling quality of C. equisetifolia under tropical nursery conditions.

AB  - Knowledge of how forest management influences soil microbial community interactions is necessary for complete understanding of forest ecology. In this study, soil microbial communities, vegetation characteristics and soil physical and chemical properties were examined across a rectangular 4.57 x 36.58 m sample grid spanning adjacent coniferous forest and clearcut areas. Based on analysis of soil extracted phospholipid fatty acids, total microbial biomass, fungi and Gram-negative bacteria were found to be significantly reduced in soil of the clearcut area relative to the forest. Concurrent with changes in microbial communities, soil macroaggregate stability was reduced in the clearcut area, while no significant differences in soil pH and organic matter content were found. Variography indicated that the range at which spatial autocorrelation between samples was evident (patch size) was greater for all microbial groups analyzed in the clearcut area. Overall, less spatial structure could be resolved in the forest. Variance decomposition using principal coordinates of neighbor matrices spatial variables indicated that soil aggregate stability and vegetation characteristics accounted for significant microbial community spatial variation in analyses that included the entire plot. When clearcut and forest areas were analyzed separately, different environmental variables (pH in the forest area and soil organic matter in the clearcut) were found to account for variation in soil microbial communities, but little of this variation could be ascribed to spatial interactions. Most microbial variation explained by different components of microbial communities occurred at spatial scales other than those analyzed. Fungi accounted for over 50\% of the variation in bacteria of the forest area but less than 11\% in the clearcut. Conversely, AMF accounted for significant variation in clearcut area, but not forest, bacteria. These results indicate broadly disparate controls on soil microbial community composition in the two systems. We present multiple lines of evidence pointing toward shifts in fungi functional groups as a salient mechanism responsible for qualitative, quantitative and spatial distribution differences in soil microbial communities.

AB  - Community assembly history is increasingly recognized as a fundamental determinant of community structure. However, little is known as to how assembly history may affect ecosystem functioning via its effect on community structure. Using wood-decaying fungi as a model system, we provide experimental evidence that large differences in ecosystem functioning can be caused by small differences in species immigration history during community assembly. Direct manipulation of early immigration history resulted in threefold differences in fungal species richness and composition and, as a consequence, differences of the same magnitude in the rate of decomposition and carbon release from wood. These effects - which were attributable to the history-dependent outcome of competitive and facilitative interactions - were significant across a range of nitrogen availabilities observed in natural forests. Our results highlight the importance of considering assembly history in explaining ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Pyrosequencing, a non-electrophoretic method of DNA sequencing, was used to investigate the extensive fungal community in soils of three islands in the Yellow Sea of Korea, between Korea and China. Pyrosequencing was carried out on amplicons derived from the 5' region of 18S rDNA. A total of 10,166 reads were obtained, with an average length of 103 bp. The maximum number of fungal phylotypes in soil predicted at 99\% similarity was 3,334. The maximum numbers of phylotypes predicted at 97\% and 95\% similarities were 736 and 286, respectively. Through phylogenetic assignment using BLASTN, a total of 372 tentative taxa were identified. The majority of true fungal sequences recovered in this study belonged to the Ascomycota (182 tentative taxa in 2,708 reads) and Basidiomycota (172 tentative taxa in 6,837 reads). The predominant species of Ascomycota detected have been described as lichen-forming fungi, litter/wood decomposers, plant parasites, endophytes, and saprotrophs: Peltigera neopolydactyla (Lecanoromycetes), Paecilomyces sp. (Sordariomycetes), Phacopsis huuskonenii (Lecanoromycetes), and Raffaelea hennebertii (mitosporicAscomycota). The majority of sequences in the Basidiomycota matched ectomycorrhizal and wood rotting fungi, including species of the Agaricales and Aphyllophorales, respectively. A high number of sequences in the Thelephorales, Boletales, Stereales, Hymenochaetales, and Ceratobasidiomycetes were also detected. By applying high-throughput pyrosequencing, we observed a high diversity of soil fungi and found evidence that pyrosequencing is a reliable technique for investigating fungal communities in soils.

AB  - Among tree fine roots, the distal small-diameter lateral branches comprising first- and second-order roots lack secondary (wood) development. Therefore, these roots are expected to decompose more rapidly than higher order woody roots. But this prediction has not been tested and may not be correct. Current evidence suggests that lower order roots may decompose more slowly than higher order roots in tree species associated with ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi because they are preferentially colonized by fungi and encased by a fungal sheath rich in chitin (a recalcitrant compound). In trees associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, lower order roots do not form fungal sheaths, but they may have poorer C quality, e.g. lower concentrations of soluble carbohydrates and higher concentrations of acid-insolubles than higher order roots, thus may decompose more slowly. In addition, litter with high concentrations of acid insolubles decomposes more slowly under higher N concentrations (such as lower order roots). Therefore, we propose that in both AM and EM trees, lower order roots decompose more slowly than higher order roots due to the combination of poor C quality and high N concentrations. To test this hypothesis, we examined decomposition of the first six root orders in Fraxinus mandshurica (an AM species) and Larix gmelinii (an EM species) using litterbag method in northeastern China. We found that lower order roots of both species decomposed more slowly than higher order roots, and this pattern appears to be associated mainly with initial C quality and N concentrations. Because these lower order roots have short life spans and thus dominate root mortality, their slow decomposition implies that a substantial fraction of the stable soil organic matter pool is derived from these lower order roots, at least in the two species we studied.

AB  - Understanding how abiotic conditions mediate the outcome of biotic interactions is a key question in community ecology. This is particularly interesting in the case of mutualisms because changing environmental conditions may be a source of evolutionary or ecological instability in the relationship between symbiotic partners. For the mycorrhizal symbiosis, elevated nutrient levels may make the carbon cost to plants of supporting mycorrhizal fungi outweigh the benefits of mycorrhizal nutrient acquisition. In this study, we simulated the effects of post-fire nutrient enrichment on the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis between Rhizopogon occidentalis and Pinus muricata by using factorial combinations of soil heating, ash addition and mycorrhizal colonization. In general, the presence of R. occidentalis and the heat and ash treatments increased growth of P. muricata seedlings. However, significant interactions between the treatments indicated that there were context-dependent effects on seedling growth. Soil heating increased soil mineral nitrogen content, but did not decrease the benefit of mycorrhizal colonization relative to unheated controls. This appeared to be driven by a decrease in the proportion of the root system occupied by R. occidentalis, indicating that host-plants can optimize colonization in a way that maximizes growth. Because seedlings in heat-treated soils were larger than unheated controls, reduced percent colonization did not cause any decrease in fungal biomass in heat-treated soils. Since there was no decrease in the performance of either partner, our results show that, in this system, ectomycorrhizal mutualisms are likely robust within the natural degree of environmental variability caused by moderate intensity wildfires.

AB  - Soil nutrient environments are changing in forests of the northeastern United States due to decades of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) emissions and acidic deposition, causing N enrichment and cation depletion, and possibly alleviating N limitation to forest growth. We asked whether biotic demand for phosphorus (P) or calcium (Ca) exceeded that for N and used an ingrowth core approach to test belowground responses to different nutrients. We tested fine root foraging for nutrients (N, P, or Ca) in three mid-age (26-30 years) and mature (a parts per thousand yen100 years) northern hardwood forest stands in the Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF), NH, and in one mature forest stand in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH, USA. Fine root colonization of cores responded clearly to Ca in mature forest at HBEF, responded to P in mid-age forests at BEF, and responded primarily to N in mature forests at BEF. Net N mineralization potential was higher in soils of mid-age than mature forests at BEF, with roots responding to N where N availability was low and to P or Ca where N availability was high. Nutrients elicited no responses from either fungi or phosphatase activity in mid-age forests, but in mature forests at BEF, N enhanced phosphatase activity. While no straightforward pattern emerged among the different mechanisms of nutrient acquisition that we tested, our results do suggest that P and Ca can be important limiting nutrients in these northern hardwood forests when N availability is relatively high. We hypothesize that the interacting effects of disturbance by forest harvest and N deposition can cause a transient P limitation to forest growth, and that other nutrients become more limiting as forests age.

AB  - Plant and microbial use of nitrogen (N) can be simultaneously mutualistic and competitive, particularly in ecosystems dominated by mycorrhizal fungi. Our goal was to quantify plant uptake of organic and inorganic N across a broad latitudinal gradient of forest ecosystems that varied with respect to overstory taxon, edaphic characteristics, and dominant mycorrhizal association. Using C-13 and N-15, we observed in situ the cycling dynamics of NH4 (+) and glycine through various soil pools and fine roots over 14 days. Recovery of N-15 as soil N varied with respect to N form, forest type, and sampling period; however, there were similarities in the cycling dynamics of glycine and NH4 (+) among all forest types. Microbial immobilization of N-15 was immediately apparent for both treatments and represented the largest sink (similar to 25\%) for N-15 among extractable soil N pools during the first 24 h. In contrast, fine roots were a relatively small sink (< 10\%) for both N forms, but fine root C-13 enrichment indicated that plants in all forest types absorbed glycine intact, suggesting that plants and microbes effectively target the same labile soil N pools. Relative uptake of amino acid-N versus NH4 (+) varied significantly among sites and approximately half of this variation was explained by mycorrhizal association. Estimates of plant uptake of amino acid-N relative to NH4 (+) were 3x higher in ectomycorrhizal-dominated stands (1.6 +/- A 0.2) than arbuscular mycorrhizae-dominated stands (0.5 +/- A 0.1). We conclude that free amino acids are an important component of the N economy in all stands studied; however, in these natural environments plant uptake of organic N relative to inorganic N is explained as much by mycorrhizal association as by the availability of N forms per se.

AB  - Extracellular enzymes mediate the degradation, transformation and mineralization of soil organic matter. The activity of cellulases, phosphatases and other hydrolases has received extensive study and in many cases stoichiometric relationships and responses to disturbances are well established. In contrast, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities, which are often uncorrelated with hydrolase activities, have been measured in only a small subset of soil enzyme studies. These enzymes are expressed for a variety of purposes including ontogeny, defense and the acquisition of carbon and nitrogen. Through excretion or lysis, these enzymes enter the environment where their aggegrate activity mediates key ecosystem functions of lignin degradation, humification, carbon mineralization and dissolved organic carbon export. Phenol oxidases and peroxidases are less stable in the environment than extracellular hydrolases, especially when associated with organic particles. Activities are also affected, positively and negatively, by interaction with mineral surfaces. High spatiotemporal variation obscures their relationships with environmental variables and ecological process. Across ecosystems, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities generally increase with soil pH, a finding not predicted from the pH optima of purified enzymes. Activities associated with plant litter and particulate organic matter often correlate with decomposition rates and potential activities generally increase with the lignin and secondary compound content of the material. At the ecosystem scale, nitrogen amendment alters the expression of phenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes more broadly than culture studies imply and these responses correlate with positive and negative changes in litter decomposition rates and soil organic matter content. At the global scale, N amendment of basidiomycete-dominated soils of temperate and boreal forest ecoystems often leads to losses of oxidative enzyme activity, while activities in grassland soils dominated by glomeromycota and ascomycetes show little net response. Land use that leads to loss of soil organic matter tends to increase oxidative activities. Across ecosystems, soil organic matter content is not correlated with mean potential phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities. A multiple regression model that includes soil pH, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and potential phenol oxidase activity accounts for 37\% of the variation in soil organic matter (SOM) content across ecosystems (n = 63); a similar model for peroxidase activity describes 32\% of SOM variance (n = 43). Analysis of residual variation suggest that suites of interacting factors create both positive and negative feedbacks on soil organic matter storage. Soils with high oxygen availability, pH and mineral activity tend to be substrate limited: high in situ oxidative activities limit soil organic matter accumulation. Soils with opposing characteristics are activity limited: low in situ oxidative activities promote soil organic matter storage. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the response of native plant species to changed growing conditions, especially increased shade, following establishment of exotic Pinus radiata plantation on cleared native eucalypt forest. in the Northern Hemisphere, species tolerant to shading are typically herbaceous perennials, with large seeds, no obvious mechanism of seed dispersal, and spread by clonal means. We investigated whether life form, mode of seed dispersal, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), nutrient uptake strategy, seed mass, fire response, plant height, and clonal spread differed between understorey species of pine plantation and native forest. Further, we asked whether plant functional traits that confer tolerance to stress through shading differ from those in other floras. The study was conducted on the Delatite Peninsula in north-eastern Victoria, Australia. Vegetation of adjacent native forest and pine plantation were surveyed using eight 7 m x 7 m plots per site, randomly located within five paired sites. Differences in plant traits between land-use types were tested by Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling (NMDS), analysis of similarity (ANOSIM)and paired t-tests. Cluster analysis of the nine plant traits was used to define emergent groups, with differences between land-use types examined by ANOSIM and indicator species analysis. There was a significant change in the composition of understorey vegetation following conversion to pine plantation that included a decline in the richness of native species. NMDS of plant attributes showed a clear separation of native forest from pine plantation with land use strongly correlated in ordination space (r(2) = 0.611). Cluster analysis produced seven emergent groups of plant functional traits for 78 identified plant species. Phanerophytes split into two groups (myrmecochorous trees and shrubs; myrmecochorous shrubs), perennial herbs into four groups (upright herbs, myrmecochorous herbs, barochorous herbs, flat rosette herbs) with one group representing therophytes and anemochorous perennials. Perennial herbs with intermediate SLA and clonal spread were tolerant of the shaded conditions in pine plantation while the two groups of phanerophytes and the myrmecochorous herbs were largely excluded. Shared traits of excluded emergent groups included those that provided an over-riding adaptation to mineral nutrient stress. including myrmecochory, low SLA, ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal associations and N-2-fixation. These plant traits could not provide tolerance to stress through shading, which is better explained by the open canopied nature of the native forest. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Liming is a forestry practice used to counteract forest decline in acidic soils. It consists of direct Ca and Mg input to forest soil, which restores tree mineral nutrition, but also modifies microbial communities in soil. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of liming on both belowground (ectomycorrhizal root tips) and aboveground (epigeous sporocarps) fungal communities. Results showed that the modification of soil chemical properties ( pH, and Ca-Mg contents versus total free Al and Fe concentrations) was a stronger factor of ECM community structuring than tree host. The species appearing in limed plots were ubiquist or known as good competitors and replaced acidophilic and stress species. At the sporocarp level, tree host was a stronger factor of community structuring than soil chemical properties associated with liming. On the whole, there was a shift in the community composition from a typical acidophilic forest fungal community of medium altitude in the untreated plots to a less typical one, with the reduced dominance of acidophilic fungi while many late-stage forest species appeared. We finally suggest a marker species (Russula ochroleuca) to assess both above and belowground effects of liming on ectomycorrhizal communities.

AB  - The growth of Eucalyptus regnans F.Muell. (mountain ash) seedlings is poor in natural forest soil, where purple coloration of the foliage indicates P deficiency and where the fungus Cylindrocarpon destructans (Zinsm.) Scholten is commonly isolated from the roots of the seedlings. When forest soil is air-dried, P acquisiton and growth of seedlings are markedly improved, although the degree of growth stimulation varies considerably at different times, as does the frequency of occurrence of C. destructans on the roots. C. destructans has been implicated as a possible reason for suppressed growth of seedlings in undried natural soil. To find out whether C. destructans contributes to growth inhibition of E. regnans seedlings in undried forest soil, the effect of three isolates of C. destructans on the root growth of E. regnans seedlings was tested in Petri dish experiments in vitro and the effect of C. destructans inoculation on seedling growth both in air-dried and undried forest soil was tested in pot experiments. The frequency of occurrence of C. destructans on the roots varied at different times, and was not consistently higher in undried than in air-dried soil, even though the growth of the seedlings was always poor in undried soil compared with that in air-dried soil. In vitro, C. destructans decreased the root growth significantly and caused blackening of root tips. This effect was removed by adding natural air-dried or undried soil. In pot experiments using undried forest soil, there was no evidence of either direct toxic effect or any other adverse effect on the roots when soil was inoculated with this fungus, even when the growth of the seedlings was reduced to similar to 1/2 of that in uninoculated undried soil. In air-dried soil, inoculation with the fungus did not significantly reduce seedling growth. Although potentially pathogenic and able to cause blackening of root tips, C. destructans is unlikely to be the main reason for poor seedling growth in undried forest soil. It appears to be antagonistic rather than pathogenic, suppressing seedling growth only under unfavourable conditions, such as in undried soil, possibly by competing for limited nutrients, or by suppressing other beneficial micro-organisms. The results are discussed in the context of field conditions.

AB  - Samples of rhizosphere soil and bulk soil were collected from under Araucaria bidwillii in a tropical montane rainforest at Mount Lewis forest reserve, Queensland, Australia. DNA was extracted from soil and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles of PCR-amplified partial rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rhizosphere and bulk soil samples compared. Neither canonical analysis of the principal coordinates nor principal component analysis revealed clear separation of soil samples according to their origin in rhizosphere or bulk soil. Following amplification of rDNA ITS regions using the primers ITS1-F and ITS4, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence analyses were also used to identify fungal sequences that were present in clone assemblages from rhizosphere soil and bulk soil. A total of fifty-three RFLP types were thus identified, with the majority being ascomycetes and the remainder basidiomycetes or zygomycetes. Nine RFLP types had affinity with Mortier-ellaceae, and phylogenetic analysis indicated that these probably represent multiple Mortierella species in both rhizosphere and bulk soil samples. Similar evidence was obtained for the presence of multiple Trichosporon species. RFLP type 53 from a bulk soil sample was identified as a Soil Clone Group I ascomycete, confirming the widespread occurrence of this group.

AB  - Forest litter is a large reservoir of organic compounds that adds CO2 to the atmospheric carbon pool when it decomposes. Predicting CO2 efflux from litter decomposition is difficult because litter can undergo significant diurnal and day-to-day shifts in temperature. Moreover, the relationship between temperature and respiration may change if the decomposer microorganisms acclimate to short-term temperature changes. Therefore, we studied the relationship between temperature and respiration by litter decomposer microorganisms in a Pinus resinosa (Ait.) system and tested the hypothesis that their respiration acclimates to temperature. We found only limited evidence for acclimation following 6 degrees C shifts for 7 days. This suggests that increase in respiratory CO2 loss associated with increased temperature would not be greatly ameliorated by physiological acclimation for periods of up to a week.

AB  - We examined T matsutake survived in soil after forest fires in T matsutake-produced forest in the pre-fire period and the situation of damages from forest fire in stands. We established a square plot of (50 mx50 m) in a burned site and divided it into 100 square quadrats of (5 mx5 m). Tree density of P densiflora, the dominant tree species, in plot was 2,104/ha, with a basal area accounting for 99\%. The percentage of dead pine trees was 52.1\%, which is less than in other species as 88.6\% and 100\% of Quercus spp. and Prunus sargentii, respectively. In PCR amplification using the T matsutake-specific primer pair, the 400-bp fragment was found in 29 of 100 soil sample s from each quadrat and in control Cultures. The relationship to the percentage of crown damage differed significantly (p=0.0026), with means between Tin and nTm of 59\% and 70.5\%, respectively. Moreover, the difference between BLT and nBLT on crown damage was highly significant in the U-test (p=0.0008). Therefore, P densiflora in inner quadrats with low crown damage had T matsutake on their roots. T matsutake favor P densiflora and mineral soils with low litter rather than under BLT with a thick humus layer. The area of T matsutake from a forest fire in crown damage to R densiflora will eventually decrease in relation to the increase in BLT. Hence, the species distribution in understory vegetation such as shrub and BLT is an important factor for overstory tree survival from forest fires. In conclusion, the management of T matsutake forest by controlling tree density and taking out understory vegetation is considered a good method for decreasing damage from forest fires.

AB  - The effects of pine and oak forest litter on mycorrhizal status of 2-year-old Pinus sylvestris L. seedlings grown in a bare-root nursery was investigated. The research was carried out in the nursery of Vilnius University Botanical Garden in Lithuania. Ectomycorrhizal communities were assessed by a combination of morphological and molecular techniques. Statistical analysis revealed significant effect of litter treatment on some growth parameters of seedlings: seedling height, needle dry weight and total seedling weight. The survival rate of seedlings was significantly highest for oak litter, intermediate for pine litter, and lowest for control soil. Pine seedlings were colonized by indigenous ecto- and ectendomycorrhizal symbionts. Seven mycorrhizal species (Suillus luteus, S. variegatus, Wilcoxina mikolae, Tuber sp., Tomentella sp., Cenorococcum geophilum, Amphinema byssoides) were distinguished on the roots of pine seedlings as well as one ectomycorrhizal symbiont not identified to species level. In total, 6 mycorrhizal types were found in control soil, 5 in pine litter, and 8 in oak litter. Suilloid (S. luteus and S. variegatus) and Wilcoxina mycorrhizae were dominant on tested seedlings, irrespective of litter addition. Seedlings grown in untreated nursery soil were 34\% colonized by W. mikolae, while suilloid mycorrhizae were dominant after litter treatment (81\% in pine litter and 63\% in oak litter). We may conclude that suilloid mycorrhizae are better adapted to the conditions related to litter addition than W. mikolae.

AB  - The ability of earthworms to digest and assimilate microorganisms varies greatly with the earthworm species, its ecological group, character of food and environmental conditions in which earthworms live. In the current study, actinomycetes were isolated from casts of the two endogeic (Aporrectodea caliginosa, Octolasion tyrtaeum) and an epigeic (Dendrobaena octaedra) earthworm to determine the nature of naturally existing actinomycete community in earthworm casts. Earthworms were kept in soil free compartmented chambers containing leaf litter colonized with actinomycetes antagonistic to litter decomposer fungi and actinomycetes not antagonistic to litter decomposer fungi to infer feeding preferences of earthworms. The actinomycete population dynamics of the casts of the earthworms fed with single antagonistic actinomycete species and soil supplemented with these casts were investigated in order to understand the impacts of both endogeic and epigeic earthworms on the dispersal of actinomycetes antagonistic to the decomposer fungi. According to the current study, the cast actinomycete communities of epigeic (i.e. D. octaedra) and endogeic earthworms (i.e. A. caliginosa, O. tyrtaeum) consisted of frequently isolated actinomycetes of the forest floor. All the cast actinomycetes were Streptomyces species and most of them were found to be antagonistic to the common litter and wood decomposer fungi. All the casts had higher actinomycete counts than those in the surrounding soil. When leaf litter inoculated with antagonistic and non-antagonistic actinomycetes was supplied as the food choices for the earthworms, they preferentially consumed some of the highly antagonistic actinomycetes as well as some weakly antagonistic actinomycetes but the order of preference depended on the earthworm species. Many of the actinomycetes antagonistic to litter decomposer fungi survived gut passage but analysis of earthworm casts did not show any increase in actinomycete numbers during gut passage. The actinomycetes in earthworm casts were able to successfully spread into surrounding soil thereby increasing the existing community size of actinomycetes in natural soil. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We conducted line route censuses of fungal fruiting bodies from August to September in 2005 and 2006 along ridges and valleys and compared the differences in the encounter rates of fungal fruiting bodies (= fruiting bodies seen per census kilometer) between types of topography and between fungal functional groups (i.e., ectomycorrhizal and saprobic fungi) in warm temperate evergreen broad-leaved forests on Yakushima Island, Japan. We found 251 fungal fruiting bodies (26 families, 50 genera, and 65 species) in total, including 51 bodies from Tricholomataceae, 41 from Russulaceae, 25 from Boletaceae, and 19 from Amanitaceae. The encounter rate of ectomycorrhizal fungi was greater at the ridge route (26.7 unit/km) than at the valley route (8.7 unit/km) and that of saprobic fungi was greater at the valley route (25.0 unit/km) than at the ridge route (12.5 unit/km). In addition, we conducted 7-year intermittent sampling and identified 40 families, 96 genera, and 142 species. The topography-specific emergence pattern of the intermittent sampling method was similar to that of the line census method. The fungal species composition in this study was possibly affected by a topographic gradient for both fungal functional groups through soil moisture, nutrient availability, and host tree distribution.

AB  - An accurate assessment of soil organic matter dynamics is critical for understanding and predicting ecosystem responses to anthropogenic perturbation such as climate change, pollution and agriculture. These measurements of carbon (C) turnover are frequently made in the laboratory where it is easier to control the experimental conditions. However, this could potentially bias the results due to a range of factors including the absence of plants and associated mycorrhizas, physical disturbance, alteration in redox status etc. The aim of this study was therefore to directly compare the turnover of organic acids under field and laboratory conditions in three contrasting land use regimes (grassland, woodland and arable). The method involved the injection of C-14-labeled citric acid into the top soil and monitoring of its mineralization by capturing (CO2)-C-14 evolved from the soil over a 7 day period. Laboratory climate conditions were matched to those in the field. In both the laboratory and the field we showed that (CO2)-C-14 evolution followed a bi-phasic pattern and conformed extremely well to a double first-order kinetic model. While the first rapid mineralization phase showed a similar half-life for citrate under both laboratory and field conditions (4.9 +/- 0.7 h), the second slower mineralization phase had a significantly longer half-life when performed in the field. Overall, our results suggest that the first rapid mineralization phase was largely independent of our experimental conditions whilst the turnover of the citrate-derived C immobilized in the microbial biomass was significantly affected by the incubation conditions either due to differences in substrate utilization and storage pathways or due to faster microbial turnover in the laboratory.

Ectomycorrhizal fungi benefit host plant by absorbing phosphorus with the help of acid and alkaline phosphatases. Acid and alkaline phosphatases are cell wall-bound enzymes. Cantharellus tropicalis were grown in axenic cultures to determine the activity of acid phosphatase by a quantitative colorimetric method. The effects of pH and temperature on the activity of surface acid phosphatase were also studied. Results showed that the optimal pH and temperature of the C. tropicalis strain were 4 and 40 degrees C respectively.

AB  - A comprehensive appraisal of the mycorrhizal literature provides data for 336 plant families representing 99\% of flowering plants, with regard to mycorrhizas and other nutritional adaptations. In total, arbuscular (AM), orchid, ectomycorrhizas (EM) and ericoid mycorrhizas and nonmycorrhizal (NM) roots occur in 74\%, 9\%, 2\%, 1\% and 6\% of Angiosperm species respectively. Many families of NM plants have alternative nutritional strategies such as parasitism, carnivory, or cluster roots. The remaining angiosperms (8\%) belong to families reported to have both AM and NM species. These are designated as NM-AM families here and tend to occur in habitats considered non-conducive to mycorrhizal fungi, such as epiphytic, aquatic, extremely cold, dry, disturbed, or saline habitats. Estimated numbers of species in each category of mycorrhizas is presented with lists of NM and EM families. Evolutionary trends are also summarised by providing data on all clades and orders of flowering and non-flowering vascular plants on a global scale. A case study of Western Australian plants revealed that plants with specialised nutritional modes such as carnivory, cluster roots, or EM were much more diverse in this ancient landscape with infertile soils than elsewhere. Detailed information on the mycorrhizal diversity of plants presented here is linked to a website (mycorrhizas.info) to allow data to remain current. Over a century of research effort has resulted in data on mycorrhizal associations of > 10,000 plant species that are of great value, but also somewhat of a liability due to conflicting information about some families and genera. It is likely that these conflicts result in part from misdiagnosis of mycorrhizal associations resulting from a lack of standardisation in criteria used to define them. Families that contain both NM and AM species provide a second major source of inconsistency, but even when these are excluded there is a similar to 10\% apparent error rate in published lists of mycorrhizal plants. Arbuscules are linked to AM misdiagnosis since they are used less often than vesicles to recognise AM associations in roots and apparently occur sporadically in NM plants. Key issues with the diagnosis of mycorrhizal plants are discussed using the Cyperaceae as a case study. Detailed protocols designed to consistently distinguish AM from endophytic Glomeromycotan Fungus Colonisation (GFC) are provided. This review aims to stimulate debate and provide advice to researchers delving into root biology.

AB  - Temporal fluctuations of present and expressed fungal genes encoding the ligninolytic enzyme laccase were examined bimonthly between March 2004 and April 2005 in the organic horizon of a beech forest Cambisol. Using two sets of degenerate primer pairs, we detected 73 different basidiomycete laccase genes from soil DNA extracts and 42 different transcripts of asco- and basidiomycetes from soil RNA Phylogenetic analysis related the sequences to fungal taxa. The highest fungal laccase extracts (cDNA). gene richness in soil DNA and RNA samples were found in August, October and January, and followed the input of fresh litter into soil. The highest change of the fungal laccase gene population was observed from but no distinct temporal change in the total soil laccase activity was measured. October to January, Present and expressed laccase gene populations were highly different, implying different subsets amplified with our primer sets and likely impacting future research strategies. Despite considerable variations in gene presence and expression, we found a steady expression and high soil enzyme activity of fungal laccases at each sampling date, thus presumably laccases have major impacts to soil organic matter turnover and stabilization processes.

AB  - Mature deciduous forests can serve as important carbon (C) sinks, but the C storage differs significantly in dependency on the tree species. To specify the significance of overstory-specific effects of litter fall on the soil microbial C turnover, we have investigated the C-13 isotopic signature of microbial biomarker phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Samples were taken under pure Fagus sylvatica and mixed overstory (F. sylvatica and Fraxinus excelsior or F. excelsior, Acer spp. and F. sylvatica) in a mature temperate deciduous forest in Central Germany 4 weeks prior to and 3 weeks after litter fall. Accordingly, the CO2 emission from soil was measured before, during and after the litter fall to investigate the response of decomposition. At all sites and at both sampling dates the fungal biomarker PLFA 18:2 omega 6,9 had predominantly lower delta C-13 values (from -32 to -43 parts per thousand) than the bacterial biomarker PLFAs (delta C-13 values from -23 to -39 parts per thousand). This difference indicated that fungi generally used preferentially plant derived C, whereas the bacterial populations include groups which used SOM derived C, independent on the overstory, trees. Under pure F. sylvatica overstory the delta C-13 values of microbial biomarker PLFAs were slightly decreased (up to 2 parts per thousand for 17:0br) or unchanged after litter fall. By contrast, under both variants of mixed overstory the delta C-13 values of biomarker PLFAs of fungi (18:2w6,9) were increased after litter fall (+3.5 and +3.8 parts per thousand). This might be explained partly by a faster initial decomposition of foliar litter from mixed overstory already during litter fall as confirmed by higher CO2 emission under mixed F. excelsior, Acer spp. and F. sylvatica than under pure F sylvatica in this period. However, the involved microbial populations differed overstory-specific. Bacterial biomarker PLFAs with strongest overstory-specific differences in the response on litter fall were 17:0br (Gram-positive bacteria), 18:1 and 19:0cy (Gram-negative bacteria). The present results indicate that a tree species conversion even exclusively between deciduous tree species might alter the soil microbial C turnover during litter decomposition and suggest that it would in the long-term change the SOM stability and C storage.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the monoterpene content and distribution in litters and roots of three conifer species: Picea abies (L) Karst, Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. and Pinus sylvestris (L). We analysed the monoterpene content of green needles, needle litter, F (fermentation) layer material and roots collected from monoculture plots. The rate of loss of monoterpenes from freshly fallen litter in the field was also studied at two monthly intervals over 10 months, to assess the length of time that monoterpenes entering the litter layer remain. Monoterpene analysis was carried out by extracting homogenised samples in hexane and identifying and quantifying the resulting monoterpenes using gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Mean total monoterpene concentrations varied significantly between the three species examined (e.g. in freshly fallen litter 1531 +/- 96, 100 +/- 5 and 1175 +/- 122 mu g g(-1) d. wt for P. abies, P. sitchensis and P. sylvestris); each species had distinctive and consistent monoterpene profiles associated with each type of tissue, and total monoterpene concentrations in green needles varied between individual trees of the same species, particularly for P. sitchensis. A substantial proportion of the monoterpene content of green needles remained in the needles after litter fall for P. abies (42\%), P. sitchensis (11\%) and P. sylvestris (30\%). Although rates of monoterpene loss from needle litters varied initially (P sylvestris > P. abies > P. sitchensis), the majority of the monoterpene content was lost after 4-6 months. Maximum monoterpene emission rates from decaying litter were calculated of 39 (P abies), 1.7 (P. sitchensis) and 39 mu g m(-2) h(-1) (P. sylvestris). Monoterpene concentrations in F layer material were very low (<10 mu g g(-1) d. wt). Roots, particularly in P. sylvestris, represented a significant pool of monoterpenes (185 +/- 16, P. abies; 258 +/- 54, P. sitchensis; 2133 +/- 200 mu g g(-1) d. wt, P. sylvestris). The monoterpene profile was similar between roots and litter of P. sylvestris (a-pinene most abundant), and for P. sitchensis, (limonene and a-pinene most abundant), although a different pattern was observed between needle litter (most abundant beta-pinene) and roots (most abundant myrcene) of P abies. The relatively high concentrations and different profiles of monoterpenes characterised in upper organic soil horizons here emphasise the need for their influence on soil ecological processes to be assessed.

AB  - Carbon dioxide is released from the soil to the atmosphere in heterotrophic respiration when the dead organic matter is used for substrates for soil micro-organisms and soil animals. Respiration of roots and mycorrhiza is another major source of carbon dioxide in soil CO2 efflux. The partitioning of these two fluxes is essential for understanding the carbon balance of forest ecosystems and for modelling the carbon cycle within these ecosystems. In this study, we determined the carbon balance of three common tree species in boreal forest zone, Scots pine, Norway spruce, and Silver birch with gas exchange measurements conducted in laboratory in controlled temperature and light conditions. We also studied the allocation pattern of assimilated carbon with C-14 pulse labelling experiment. The photosynthetic light responses of the tree species were substantially different. The maximum photosynthetic capacity (P (max)) was 2.21 mu g CO2 s(-1) g(-1) in Scots pine, 1.22 mu g CO2 s(-1) g(-1) in Norway spruce and 3.01 mu g CO2 s(-1) g(-1) in Silver birch seedlings. According to the pulse labelling experiments, 43-75\% of the assimilated carbon remained in the aboveground parts of the seedlings. The amount of carbon allocated to root and rhizosphere respiration was about 9-26\%, and the amount of carbon allocated to root and ectomycorrhizal biomass about 13-21\% of the total assimilated CO2. The (CO2)-C-14 pulse reached the root system within few hours after the labelling and most of the pulse had passed the root system after 48 h. The transport rate of carbon from shoot to roots was fastest in Silver birch seedlings.

AB  - Anthropogenic release of biologically available N has increased atmospheric N deposition in forest ecosystems, which may slow decomposition by reducing the lignolytic activity of white-rot fungi. We investigated the potential for atmospheric N deposition to reduce the abundance and alter the composition of lignolytic basidiomycetes in a regional network of four northern hardwood forest stands receiving experimental NO3 (-) deposition (30 kg NO3 (-)-N ha(-1) year(-1)) for a decade. To estimate the abundance of basidiomycetes with lignolytic potential, we used PCR primers targeting laccase (polyphenol oxidase) and quantitative fluorescence PCR to estimate gene copy number. Natural variation in laccase gene size permitted use of length heterogeneity PCR to profile basidiomycete community composition across two sampling dates in forest floor and mineral soil. Although past work has identified significant and consistent negative effects of NO3 (-) deposition on lignolytic enzyme activity, microbial biomass, soil respiration, and decomposition rate, we found no consistent effect of NO3 (-) deposition on basidiomycete laccase gene abundance or community profile. Rather, laccase abundance under NO3 (-) deposition was lower (-52\%), higher (+223\%), or unchanged, depending on stand. Only a single stand exhibited a significant change in basidiomycete laccase gene profile. Basidiomycete laccase genes occurring in mineral soil were a subset of the genes observed in the forest floor. Moreover, significant effects on laccase abundance were confined to the forest floor, suggesting that species composition plays some role in determining how lignolytic basidiomycetes are affected by N deposition. Community profiles differed between July and October sampling dates, and basidiomycete communities sampled in October had lower laccase gene abundance in the forest floor, but higher laccase abundance in mineral soil. Although experimental N deposition significantly suppresses lignolytic activity in these forests, this change is not related to the abundance or community composition of basidiomycete fungi with laccase genes. Understanding the expression of laccases and other lignolytic enzymes by basidiomycete fungi and other lignin-decaying organisms appears to hold promise for explaining the consistent decline in lignolytic activity elicited by experimental N deposition.

AB  - Soil organic material (SOM) is usually enriched in N-15 in deeper soil layers. This has been explained by discrimination against the heavier isotope during decomposition or by the accumulation of N-15-enriched microbial biomass versus plant biomass in older SOM. In particular, ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi have been suggested to accumulate in old SOM since this group is among the most N-15-enriched components of the microbial community. In the present study we investigated the microbial community in soil samples along a chronosequence (7,800 years) of sites undergoing isostatic rebound in northern Sweden. The composition of the microbial community was analyzed and related to the delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotope values of the SOM in soil profiles. A significant change in the composition of the microbial community was found during the first 2,000 years, and this was positively related to an increase in the delta N-15 values of the E and B horizons in the mineral soil. The proportion of fungal phospholipid fatty acids increased with time in the chronosequence and was positively related to the N-15 enrichment of the SOM. The increase in delta C-13 in the SOM was much less than the increase in delta N-15, and delta C-13 values in the mineral soil were only weakly related to soil age. The C:N ratio and the pH of the soil were important factors determining the composition of the microbial community.

AB  - Empirical and modeling studies of the N cycle in temperate forests of eastern North America have focused on the mechanisms regulating the production of inorganic N, and assumed that only inorganic forms of N are available for plant growth. Recent isotope studies in field conditions suggest that amino acid capture is a widespread ecological phenomenon, although northern temperate forests have yet to be studied. We quantified fine root biomass and applied tracer-level quantities of U-(13)C(2)-(15)N-glycine, (15)NH(4) (+) and (15)NO(3) (-) in two stands, one dominated by sugar maple and white ash, the other dominated by red oak, beech, and hemlock, to assess the importance of amino acids to the N nutrition of northeastern US forests. Significant enrichment of (13)C in fine roots 2 and 5 h following tracer application indicated intact glycine uptake in both stands. Glycine accounted for up to 77\% of total N uptake in the oak-beech-hemlock stand, a stand that produces recalcitrant litter, cycles N slowly and has a thick, amino acid-rich organic horizon. By contrast, glycine accounted for only 20\% of total N uptake in the sugar maple and white ash stand, a stand characterized by labile litter and rapid rates of amino acid production and turnover resulting in high rates of mineralization and nitrification. This study shows that amino acid uptake is an important process occurring in two widespread, northeastern US temperate forest types with widely differing rates of N cycling.

AB  - Understanding the contribution of genetic variation within foundation species to community-level pattern and diversity represents the cornerstone of the developing field of community genetics. We assessed the relative importance of intraspecific genetic variation, spatial variation within a forest and microhabitat variation on a macrofungal decay community developing on logs of the Australian forest tree, Eucalyptus globulus. Uniform logs were harvested from trees from eight geographic races of E. globulus growing in a 15-year-old genetic trial. Logs were placed as designed grids within a native E. globulus forest and after 3 years of natural colonisation the presence of 62 macrofungal taxa were recorded from eight microhabitats on each log. The key factor found to drive macrofungal distribution and biodiversity on structurally uniform coarse woody debris was log-microhabitat, explaining 42\% of the total variation in richness. Differences between log-microhabitats appeared to be due to variation in aspect, substrate (bark vs wood) and area/time of exposure to colonisation. This findings demonstrates the importance of considering fine-scale (within substrate) variation in the conservation and management of macrofungal biodiversity, an area that has received little previous attention. While a number of recent studies have demonstrated that the genetics of foundation tree species can influence dependent communities, this was not found to be the case for the early log decay community associated with E. globulus. Despite genetic variation in wood and bark properties existing within this species, there was no significant effect of tree genetics on macrofungal community richness or composition. This finding highlights the variation that may exist among guilds of organisms in their response to genetic variation within foundation species, an important consideration in a promising new area of research.

AB  - 1. The lichen Cladonia stellaris forms dense mats and dominates the forest-floor vegetation in late-successional oligotrophic boreal forests. This lichen is rich in polyphenolic secondary compounds, and through allelochemical effects of these compounds the dense mat formed by C. stellaris is assumed to have negative effect on forest regeneration and soil microbial functioning. 2. We examined the effect of C. stellaris and its secondary metabolite usnic acid on nutrient uptake and growth of pine ( Pinus sylvestris) seedlings in symbiosis with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus variegatus and in non-symbiotic condition. 3. Contrary to our expectations, usnic acid had no effect on nitrogen uptake and growth in pine seedlings. The addition of lichen fragments into the growth substrate significantly increased biomass accumulation in mycorrhizal pine seedlings and needle nitrogen acquisition in non-mycorrhizal seedlings. 4. These results suggest that lichen mats do not have direct allelopathic effects on pine seedling nitrogen acquisition or growth.

AB  - Canopy-held organic matter develops into a distinct soil system separate from the forest floor in wet temperate coniferous forests, creating a natural microcosm. We distinguished between fungal and bacterial components of the decomposer community in one site with Maple (Acer macrophyllum) and one site with Alder (Alnus rubra) by using direct measurements of growth; acetate incorporation into ergosterol, and leucine incorporation for fungi and bacteria, respectively. The higher organic matter content of the canopy soils correlated with higher fungal growth. The relative importance of fungi, indicated by fungal: bacterial growth ratio, was higher in the canopy soil of the Maple site, while there was no difference in the Alder site. The high C:N ratio of the Maple canopy soil likely contributed to this difference. These results demonstrate a divergence between canopy and forest floor that should be explored to gain insights in decomposer ecology using the natural microcosms that the canopy soils provide.

AB  - The functional roles of fungi in recovery of forest ecosystems after fire remain poorly documented. We observed macrofungi soon after fire at two widely separated sites, one in the Pacific Northwest United States and the other in southeastern mainland Australia. The range of species on-site was compared against macrofungi reported after the volcanic eruption at Mount St. Helens, also in the Pacific Northwest. Each of the three sites shared species, particularly representatives of the genus Anthracobia. Soon after disturbance, we noted extensive mycelial mats and masses of fruit-bodies of this genus, particularly at heavily impacted microsites. The mycelial mats appeared to play an important functional role on-site, possibly aggregating soil particles in otherwise highly erodable landscapes. We hypothesise that fungi such as Anthrocobia are pivotal species in early system recovery after disturbance, helping minimize the movement of soil in the absence of plant roots. As plant root systems recover, the importance of these fungi in soil stabilization may diminish. Other functional roles of early postfire fungi might include nutrient acquisition, leading to the reestablishment of vegetation. These potential roles need to be experimentally tested and relevant findings incorporated into programs aimed at restoring forest ecosystems after disturbance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Phenolics are a dominant class of plant secondary metabolites that have strong effects on various ecosystem processes. The ecological significance of these compounds, however, is still poorly understood. We hypothesized that the inhibitory effects of phenolics on microbial activity could enhance plant nitrogen acquisition by relaxing competition between plants and microbes. To test this hypothesis theoretically, we constructed a novel and simple mechanistic model by unifying two concepts: one is a new paradigm of nitrogen cycling which considers the uptake of organic nitrogen by plants, and the other is that phenolics can regulate nitrogen cycling by inhibiting microbial decomposition processes. Our plant-microbe competition model consists of five compartments (plants, soil microbes, debris, organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen) and incorporates the essential processes of nitrogen cycling: plant uptake of monomers, competition between plants and microbes, and the depolymerization process. Our analysis showed that plant nitrogen acquisition was maximized at intermediate levels of phenolics, but only when plants could utilize organic nitrogen. Furthermore, this pattern occurred over a broad range of parameter conditions. Our study successfully demonstrated the potential role of phenolics in plant nitrogen acquisition throughout natural environments.

AB  - Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition affects a wide range of soil processes including phenol oxidase (PO) activity and soil organic matter dynamics. Depression of phenol oxidase activity in response to N saturation is believed to be mediated by the activity of white-rot basidiomycetes, whose production of extracellular oxidative enzymes can be limited by high N availability. We examined the effect of short-term N deposition on basidiomycete laccase gene diversity and relative abundance in temperate oak forest soil in which significant decreases in phenol oxidase and increased SOM have been recorded in response to experimental N deposition. UniFrac was used to compare the composition of laccase genes between three control- and three nitrogen-fertilized (80 kg(-1) ha(-1) per year) oak forest soils. The relative abundance of laccase genes was determined from qPCR analysis of laccase and basidiomycete ITS gene abundances. Our results indicate that there was no significant shift in the composition of laccase genes between control- and N-fertilized soils, nor was there a significant change in the relative abundance of laccase genes. These data suggest that N deposition effects on mineral soil PO activity do not result from changes in laccase gene diversity of white-rot basidiomycetes but are likely the result of altered microbial abundance or expression in this ecosystem type. Furthermore, laccase gene composition may be tied to factors that structure microbial communities in general, as soil laccase gene communities are more similar to other forest soils than with the corresponding litter.

AB  - In forest soils, ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic Agaricales differ in their strategies for carbon acquisition, but share common gene families encoding multi-copper oxidases (MCOs). These enzymes are involved in the oxidation of a variety of soil organic compounds. The MCO gene family of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor is composed of 11 genes divided into two distinct subfamilies corresponding to laccases (lcc) sensu stricto (lcc1 to lcc9), sharing a high sequence homology with the coprophilic Coprinopsis cinerea laccase genes, and to ferroxidases (lcc10 and lcc11) that are not present in C. cinerea. The fet3-like ferroxidase genes lcc10 and lcc11 in L. bicolor are each arranged in a mirrored tandem orientation with an ftr gene coding for an iron permease. Unlike C. cinerea, L. bicolor has no sid1/sidA gene for siderophore biosynthesis. Transcript profiling using whole-genome expression arrays and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that some transcripts were very abundant in ectomycorrhizas (lcc3 and lcc8), in fruiting bodies (lcc7) or in the free-living mycelium grown on agar medium (lcc9 and lcc10), suggesting a specific function of these MCOs. The amino acid composition of the MCO substrate binding sites suggests that L. bicolor MCOs interact with substrates different from those of saprotrophic fungi.

AB  - The role of litter tannins in controlling soil nitrogen (N) cycling may explain the competitive ability of Kalmia relative to black spruce (Picea mariana), although this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here, the protein-precipitation capacities of purified tannins and leaf extracts from Kalmia and black spruce were compared. The resistance to degradation of tannin protein precipitates from both species were compared by monitoring carbon (C) and N dynamics in humus amended with protein, purified tannins or protein-tannin precipitates. The purity of the precipitates was verified using solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. The ability of mycorrhizal fungi associated with both species to grow on media amended with tannin-protein complexes as the principal N source was also compared. The protein precipitation capacity of Kalmia tannins was superior to those of black spruce. Humus amended with protein increased both mineral and microbial N, whereas humus amended with tannin-protein precipitates increased dissolved organic N. Mycorrhizal fungi associated with Kalmia showed better growth than those associated with black spruce when N was provided as tannin-protein precipitates. These data suggest that Kalmia litter increases the amount of soil N sequestered as tannin-protein complexes, which may improve the competitive ability of Kalmia relative to black spruce by favouring N uptake by mycorrhizas associated with the former.

AB  - Climate warming is expected to have particularly strong effects on tundra and boreal ecosystems, yet relatively few studies have examined soil responses to temperature change in these systems. We used closed-top greenhouses to examine the response of soil respiration, nutrient availability, microbial abundance, and active fungal communities to soil warming in an Alaskan boreal forest dominated by mature black spruce. This treatment raised soil temperature by 0.5 degrees C and also resulted in a 22\% decline in soil water content. We hypothesized that microbial abundance and activity would increase with the greenhouse treatment. Instead, we found that bacterial and fungal abundance declined by over 50\%, and there was a trend toward lower activity of the chitin-degrading enzyme N-acetyl-glucosaminidase. Soil respiration also declined by up to 50\%, but only late in the growing season. These changes were accompanied by significant shifts in the community structure of active fungi, with decreased relative abundance of a dominant Thelephoroid fungus and increased relative abundance of Ascomycetes and Zygomycetes in response to warming. In line with our hypothesis, we found that warming marginally increased soil ammonium and nitrate availability as well as the overall diversity of active fungi. Our results indicate that rising temperatures in northern-latitude ecosystems may not always cause a positive feedback to the soil carbon cycle, particularly in boreal forests with drier soils. Models of carbon cycle-climate feedbacks could increase their predictive power by incorporating heterogeneity in soil properties and microbial communities across the boreal zone.

AB  - Boreal forests contain significant quantities of soil carbon that may be oxidized to CO2 given future increases in climate warming and wildfire behavior. At the ecosystem scale, decomposition and heterotrophic respiration are strongly controlled by temperature and moisture, but we questioned whether changes in microbial biomass, activity, or community structure induced by fire might also affect these processes. We particularly wanted to understand whether postfire reductions in microbial biomass could affect rates of decomposition. Additionally, we compared the short-term effects of wildfire to the long-term effects of climate warming and permafrost decline. We compared soil microbial communities between control and recently burned soils that were located in areas with and without permafrost near Delta Junction, AK. In addition to soil physical variables, we quantified changes in microbial biomass, fungal biomass, fungal community composition, and C cycling processes (phenol oxidase enzyme activity, lignin decomposition, and microbial respiration). Five years following fire, organic surface horizons had lower microbial biomass, fungal biomass, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations compared with control soils. Reductions in soil fungi were associated with reductions in phenol oxidase activity and lignin decomposition. Effects of wildfire on microbial biomass and activity in the mineral soil were minor. Microbial community composition was affected by wildfire, but the effect was greater in nonpermafrost soils. Although the presence of permafrost increased soil moisture contents, effects on microbial biomass and activity were limited to mineral soils that showed lower fungal biomass but higher activity compared with soils without permafrost. Fungal abundance and moisture were strong predictors of phenol oxidase enzyme activity in soil. Phenol oxidase enzyme activity, in turn, was linearly related to both C-13 lignin decomposition and microbial respiration in incubation studies. Taken together, these results indicate that reductions in fungal biomass in postfire soils and lower soil moisture in nonpermafrost soils reduced the potential of soil heterotrophs to decompose soil carbon. Although in the field increased rates of microbial respiration can be observed in postfire soils due to warmer soil conditions, reductions in fungal biomass and activity may limit rates of decomposition.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (EM) basidiomycete fungi are obligate mutualists of pines and hardwoods that receive fixed C from the host tree. Though they often share most recent common ancestors with wood-rotting fungi, it is unclear to what extent EM fungi retain the ability to express enzymes that break down woody substrates. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the dominant EM fungus in a pure pine system retains the ability to produce enzymes that break down woody substrates in a natural setting, and that this ability is inducible by reduction of host photosynthetic potential via partial defoliation. To achieve this, pines in replicate blocks were defoliated 50\% by needle removal, and enzyme activities were measured in individual EM root tips that had been treated with antibiotics to prevent possible bacterial activity. Results indicate that the dominant EM fungal species (Suillus granulatus) expressed all enzymes tested (endocellulase D-glucosidase, laccase, manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, phosphatase and protease), and that activities of these enzymes increased significantly (P < 0.001) in response to defoliation. Thus, this EM fungus (one of the more specialized mutualists of pine) has the potential to play a significant role in C, N and P cycling in this forested ecosystem. Therefore, many above-ground factors that reduce photosynthetic potential or divert fixed C from roots may have wide-reaching ecosystem effects.

AB  - Tree girdling has been experimentally used to stop the allocation of carbohydrates from the canopy to tree roots and their associated ectomycorrhizal (EM) mycelia. We used three already established girdling experiments in northern Sweden, one in a Pinus sylvestris stand and two in Picea abies stands, to determine the effect of tree girdling on soil-living oribatid mites. These mites often feed on fungal hyphae, but it is not known to what extent they feed on EM or saprotrophic fungi. We hypothesised that a presumed decline in EM fungi after girdling would strongly reduce EM-feeding specialists and, correspondingly, reduce total abundance and species richness of oribatids in girdled plots. Tree girdling resulted in a significant decline in total abundance of oribatid mites in the two spruce stands, which was assumed to be linked to the decline in EM fungi, but not in the pine stand. Species richness decreased in girdled plots in one of the spruce forests. The decline in total abundance in girdled spruce stands was primarily dependent on a significant and consistent population decrease in Oppiella nova, which was the most abundant oribatid mite in the ungirdled spruce plots. Its abundance after girdling was only 8-18\% of that in ungirdled spruce plots. In the pine stand, O. nova had much lower abundance than in the spruce stands, and despite a tendency to decline in number after girdling also in the pine stand, it had a minor effect on total abundance. These results suggest that O. nova may be dependent on EM fungi in spruce forest soils, whereas the dependence on EM fungi in pine forest soils is less evident. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Significant effects of two fractions of alkali-extractable soil organic matter (AEOM) extracted from three different soils (agricultural soil, soil from deciduous forest, soil from spruce monoculture) on mycelial growth of 17 isolates of ectomycorrhizal fungi were observed. Growth of Lactarius deterrimus, Meliniomyces bicolor and one of the isolates of Leccinum aurantiacum was significantly stimulated by acid-insoluble fraction extracted from all three soils. The stimulatory effects were frequent but inhibition of mycelial growth of some isolates was also observed. The fungal response to the presence of the organic extract in the nutrient medium was isolate-specific rather than species-specific. organic matter extracted from different source soils affected differently the mycelial growth, the largest number of stimulatory effects being observed in an experiment where the extract was richest in trace the same time elements Zn and Cu. At the same time, the observed stimulatory effects were not attributable to increased concentrations of trace elements in the nutrient medium. The results indicate that soil maybe used as a source of extractable organic fractions which, when used as a cultivation medium additive, may significantly improve the growth of responsive fungal isolates. Under natural conditions, AEOM (traditionally designated humic substances) represent a potential factor affecting the composition of cenosis of ectomycorrhizal fungi in soil. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Organic phosphorus-containing compounds were extracted in alkali and analysed using P-31 NMR. Monoesters, diesters, pyrophosphates and polyphosphates detected in high amounts reflected the high metabolic activity in basidiocarps (growth, production of basidiospores). Phosphonates were present in all samples, in concentrations ranging from 14 mg kg(-1) of the extracted phosphorus in Boletus badius basidiocarp to 140 mg kg(-1) in Amanita muscuria vegetative mycelium. Detection of phosphonates in basidiocarps together with our previous evidence from laboratory experiments support the fungal production of natural phosphonates in forest ecosystems.

AB  - Activity and production of extracellular enzymes by saprotrophic litter-decomposing basidiomycetes Hypholoma fasciculare and Rhodocollybia butyracea was studied in microcosms with reconstructed L, O and Ah horizons of a soil profile of Quercus petraea forest soil. Both H.fasciculare and R. butyracea colonized the L layer of microcosms rapidly, while the colonization of 0 layer was slower. The Ah layer was substantially colonized only by R. butyracea. Enzyme activities in the soil microcosms decreased from the L layer > O layer > Ah layer and activities in microcosms inoculated with the fungi were quite similar to each other. Compared to control, the most apparent was the increase of ligninolytic enzyme activities. Laccase activities in H.fasciculare and R. butyracea-colonized L layers were 3-fold compared to control and the activity maxima of Mn-peroxidase in fungus-colonized O layers were 2-3-fold and in the L layers up to 40-fold compared to controls. Activities of cellulolytic enzymes, chitinase and acidic phosphatase in both fungal treatments were higher in the L layer on weeks 2-6 while the activity of alkaline phosphatase did not show differences between fungus-colonized and control treatments. Both fungi decreased fungal CFU in the L layer but significantly increased the counts in the O layer. Both fungi also increased bacterial CFU in the O layer, R. butyracea more than H. fasciculare. The analysis of fungal and bacterial biomass based on ergosterol content and PLFA analysis showed a sharp decrease from L to Ah layer, but did not show significant differences among treatments.

AB  - Different theories have been brought forward to explain the commonly observed delta N-15 enrichment with depth in soil profiles, including the discrimination against N-15 during N decomposition and the buildup of N-15-enriched microbial residues. A combination of soil organic matter (SOM) size and density fractionations, N-15 determinations, and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses was conducted on soils from a pristine N-limited Nothofagus forest in southern Chile. The purpose of this study was to investigate which SOM fractions mostly reflect the N-15-enrichment pattern and to link N-15 SOM enrichment with microbial community composition. Nitrogen-15 enrichments were greater for the microaggregate (< 150 mu m) than for the macroaggregate (> 150 mu m) size fraction, with Rayleigh isotope enrichment factors averaging -8.5\% and -3.7\%, respectively. The macro-organic matter density fractions (> 150 mu m) showed intermediate enrichment factors of -5.1\% and -7.3\% for the light (< 1.37 g cm-(3)) and heavy (> 1.37 g cm(-3)) fraction, respectively. The abundance of fungal and bacterial PLFAs was significantly higher in the microaggregate compared to the macroaggregate size fraction, but their relative abundance did not change between aggregate size fractions. Our data link differential N-15 enrichment of SOM fractions to ``total{''} microbial abundance and, as such, corroborates existing theories of microbial-induced N-15 enrichment. Isotopic fractionation during microbial N decomposition processes alone could not explain the large N-15 enrichment in the microaggregate size fraction (-8.5\%) and the heavy density fraction (-7.3\%). We therefore suggest that microbial turnover and accretion of N-15-enriched microbial (especially fungal) compounds was an additional driver for N-15 enrichment of this soil profile.

AB  - Climate change will increase the recurrence of extreme weather events such as drought and heavy rainfall. Evidence suggests that extreme weather events pose threats to ecosystem functioning, particularly to nutrient cycling and biomass production. These ecosystem functions depend strongly on below-ground biotic processes, including the activity and interactions among plants, soil fauna, and micro-organisms. Here, experimental grassland and heath communities of three phytodiversity levels were exposed either to a simulated single drought or to a heavy rainfall event. Both weather manipulations were repeated for two consecutive years. The magnitude of manipulations imitated the local 100-year extreme weather event. Heavy rainfall events increased below-ground plant biomass and stimulated soil enzyme activities as well as decomposition rates for both plant communities. In contrast, extreme drought did not reduce below-ground plant biomass and root length, soil enzyme activities, and cellulose decomposition rate. The low responsiveness of the measured ecosystem properties in face of the applied weather manipulations rendered the detection of significant interactions between weather events and phytodiversity impossible. Our data indicate on the one hand the close interaction between below ground plant parameters and microbial turnover processes in soil; on the other hand it shows that the plant-soil system can buffer against extreme drought events, at last for the period of investigation.

AB  - Aphyllophoraceous fungi are expected to reflect changes in the environmental conditions caused by forest use. To reveal the effects of forest uses on the fungal community structure, we performed a 3-month survey of aphyllophoraceous species in five forest types (undisturbed primary forest, isolated patches of primary forest, old and young fallow forest, and rubber plantations) in Sarawak, Malaysia in 2005. We used a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to reveal the relationships between fungal community composition and the environmental variables (canopy openness, soil water potential, amount and composition of coarse woody debris, litter mass, basal area, plant species composition). A total of 155 samples from 67 species were collected during the study period. The fungal species density represented by the number of species in a transect differed significantly among forest types. The fungal species density increased significantly with increasing number of pieces of coarse woody debris (CWD), but decreased significantly with increasing the scores of second axis of principal component analysis (PCA) for plant species composition. In the CCA ordination, automatic forward selection revealed that only the number of pieces of CWD significantly affected the fungal species composition. The occurrences of Flabellophora licmophora, Coriolopsis retropicta, Microporus vernicipes, and Amauroderma subrugosum were positively correlated with the number of pieces of CWD. Our study clearly demonstrated that forest use negatively affected aphyllophoraceous fungal diversity and suggest that the quantity of CWD would be an important determinant of fungal diversity and composition.

AB  - Mineral stress (nutrient deficiency and (or) ion toxicity) is a widespread phenomenon in forests around the world. However, with the exception of N limitation, its significance is often under appreciated. On weathered, acidic soils that support many of the world's forests, P, Ca, and Mg deficiencies and toxicities of Al and Mn are important constraints to forest productivity. Nutrient resources are a primary controller of forest function and structure and have important trophic implications, because foliar nutrient status is an important determinant of leaf palatability and consumer fitness. Nutrient acquisition and utilization in forest ecosystems is strongly influenced by environmental factors, which are changing at unprecedented rates with regional and global climate shifts. Here we examine nutrient limitations common to temperate, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) dominated forests as a model for understanding how climatic factors influence the acquisition and utilization of nutrient resources in forest ecosystems. In general, foliar nutrient imbalances created by soil weathering and acidification impair sugar maple physiology and correlate with health decline symptoms. Extremes in light environment, temperature, precipitation, pathogen attack, and herbivory tend to induce and (or) negatively interact with nutrient imbalances in sugar maple. A conceptual model is presented that characterizes abiotic and biotic interactions influencing sugar maple health and fitness in the context of nutrient limitation.

AB  - Microbes are the unseen majority in soil and comprise a large portion of life's genetic diversity. Despite their abundance, the impact of soil microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria are responsible for c. 5-20\% (grassland and savannah) to 80\% (temperate and boreal forests) of all nitrogen, and up to 75\% of phosphorus, that is acquired by plants annually. Free-living microbes also strongly regulate plant productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for, nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates suggest that c. 20 000 plant species are completely dependent on microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth. Overall, this review shows that soil microbes must be considered as important drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Controls on the colonization and abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in ecosystems are little understood and may be related to]lost factors, the fungal community, and soil physio-chemical properties; and changes in these variables during soil development may affect succession between mycorrhizal groups. Here we investigated the effects of litter, litter leachates, and common soluble phenolic compounds on AMF colonization of roots. In previous studies, we observed a negative correlation between increases in black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) litter and AMF abundance and inoculum potential along a riparian chronosequence in northwest Montana. From this, we hypothesized that litter inputs negatively affect the native AMF community and may contribute to the shift between AM F and ectomycorrhizas. We tested the effects of cottonwood foliage and litter extract additions on the colonization of AMF of both cottonwood and Sudan grass (Sorghum sudanese) seedlings. Addition of 5\% (v/v) dried cottonwood leaves completely inhibited AMF colonization of S. sudanese. AMF colonization of S. sudanese was significantly reduced by litter extract of P. trichocarpa foliage, and colonization was negatively correlated with litter extract concentrations. Additions of aqueous litter extract significantly reduced AM F colonization of cottonwood seedlings as well. The effect of the litter extract on AM F colonization of S. sudanese did not appear to be mediated by changes in soil pH or plant biomass. Available phosphorus was higher in soil receiving highest concentration of litter extract, but not at a level expected to be inhibitory to AM F colonization. Litter additions significantly increased total soil phenolics, but with a range similar to natural soils of the Nyack foodplain. We tested pure soluble phenolic compounds common to Populus for their effect oil AMF colonization by native fungi from the Nyack floodplain. All tested compounds significantly reduced AMF colonization but did not affect colonization by non-AMF root-colonizing fungi. This suggests secondary compounds present in cottonwood litter can affect colonization ability of a native AMF community. The potential mechanisms of inhibition and the relevance of these findings to AMF succession within both a single host and soil are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We warmed the top soil of a mature coniferous forest stand by means of heating cables on control and trenched plots within 24 h by 10 degrees C at 1 cm soil depth (9 degrees C at 5 cm depth) and measured the effect on the autotrophic (R-A) and heterotrophic (R-H) component of total soil CO2 efflux (R-S). The short time frame of warming enabled us to exclude confounding fluctuations in soil moisture and carbon (C) flow from the canopy. The results of the field study were backed up by a lab soil incubation experiment. During the first 12 h of warming, R-A strongly responded to soil warming; The Q(10) values were 5.61 and 6.29 for 1 and 5 cm soil depth temperature. The Q(10) values for R-A were almost twice as high as the Q(10) values of R-H (3.04 and 3.53). Q(10) values above 5 are above reasonable plant physiological values for root respiration. We see interactions of roots, mycorrhizae and heterotrophic microbes, combined with fast substrate supply to the rhizosphere as an explanation for the high short-term temperature response of R-A. When calculated over the whole duration (24 h) of the field soil-warming experiment, temperature sensitivities of R-A and R-H were similar (no significant difference at P < 0.05); Q(10) values were 3.16 and 3.96 for R-A and 2.94 and 3.35 for R-H calculated with soil temperatures at 1 and 5 cm soil depth, respectively. Laboratory incubation showed that different soil moisture contents of trenched and control plots affected rates of R-H, but did not affect the temperature sensitivity of R-H. We conclude that a single parameter is sufficient to describe the temperature sensitivity of R-S in soil C models which operate on larger temporal and spatial scales. The strong short-term response of R-A may be of relevance in soils suspected to experience increasingly strong diurnal temperature variations.

AB  - Soils and their biota have been studied by a variety of observational and experimental methods that have allowed biologists to infer their structural and functional interactions. Viewing progress made over the last 10 years, it is apparent that an increasing diversity of analytical and chemical methods are providing much more detailed information about feeding preferences and niche overlaps of speciose groups such as oribatid mites. Other topics in which considerable progress has been made include new advances in knowledge of root and mycorrhiza production and turnover and their impacts on soil ecosystems; soil biota, exudations and secretions and soil aggregation phenomena; the biology of invasive species in soils; soil biodiversity, legacies and linkages to soil processes; and soil biodiversity and ecosystem functional responses. Throughout the review I suggest ways for new progress to be made in future research. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forest soil carbon (C) pools may act as sinks for, or sources of, atmospheric carbon dioxide, while nitrogen (N) fertilization may affect the net exchange of C in forest ecosystems. Since all major C and N processes in soil are driven by soil microorganisms, we evaluated the effects of N fertilization on biomass and bacterial and fungal activity in soils from three Norway spruce forests with different climatic and N availability conditions. N deposition and net N mineralization were higher at the sites in southern Sweden than at the site in northern Sweden. We also studied the extent to which N fertilization altered the nutrient(s) limiting bacterial growth in soil. We found that on average microbial biomass was reduced by similar to 40\% and microbial activity by similar to 30\% in fertilized plots. Bacterial growth rates were more negatively affected by fertilization than fungal growth rates, while fungal biomass (estimated using the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) 18:2 omega 6,9) decreased more than bacterial biomass as a consequence of fertilization. The microbial community structure (indicated by the PLFA pattern) was changed by fertilization, but not in the same way at the three sites. Soil bacteria were limited by a lack of carbon in all forests, with the carbon limitation becoming more evident in fertilized plots, especially in the forests that had previously been the most N-limited ones. This study thus showed that the effects of N fertilization differed depending on the conditions at the site prior to fertilization. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) tends to limit plant productivity on young soils; phosphorus (P) becomes increasingly limiting in ancient soils because it gradually disappears through leaching and erosion. Plant traits that are regarded as adaptations to N- and P-limited conditions include mycorrhizas and cluster roots. Mycorrhizas `scavenge' P from solution or `mine' insoluble organic N. Cluster roots function in severely P-impoverished landscapes, `mining' P fixed as insoluble inorganic phosphates. The `scavenging' and `mining' strategies of mycorrhizalspecies without and non-mycorrhizal species with cluster roots, respectively, allow functioning on soils that differ markedly in P availability. Based on recent advances in our understanding of these contrasting strategies of nutrient acquisition, we provide an explanation for the distribution of mycorrhizal species on less P-impoverished soils, and for why, globally, cluster-bearing species dominate on severely P-impoverished, ancient soils, where P sensitivity is relatively common.

AB  - Plant host species is considered an important factor influencing ectomycorrhizal (EM) communities. To gain insights into the role of host species in structuring EM communities, EM communities on sympatric oak (Quercus) species were compared in the Sierra Nevada foothills of California. Using molecular methods (polymerase chain reaction, cloning, restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing), EM fungi on roots of deciduous Quercus douglasii and evergreen Quercus wislizeni trees were identified from 64 soil cores. The total EM species richness was 140, of which 40 taxa were detected on both oak hosts. Greater diversity and frequency of EM fungi with epigeous fruiting habit were found on Q. wislizeni, while taxa in the Ascomycota were more frequent and diverse on Q. douglasii. Using ordination, it was determined that both soil extractable phosphorus and oak host species explained a significant proportion of the variation in EM species distribution. These results indicate that plant host species can be an important factor influencing EM fungal community composition, even within congeneric trees.

AB  - The establishment and subsequent impacts of invasive plant species often involve interactions or feedbacks with the below-ground subsystem. We compared the performance of planted tree seedlings and soil communities in three ectomycorrhizal tree species at Craigieburn, Canterbury, New Zealand - two invasive species (Pseudotsuga menziesii, Douglas-fir; Pinus contorta, lodgepole pine) and one native (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides, mountain beech) - in monodominant stands. We studied mechanisms likely to affect growth and survival, i.e. nutrient competition, facilitation of carbon and nutrient transfer through mycorrhizal networks, and modification of light and soil conditions by canopy trees. Seedlings were planted in plastic tubes filled with local soil, and placed in monospecific stands. Effects of root competition from trees and mycorrhizal connections on seedling performance were tested by root trenching and use of tubes with or without a fine mesh (20 mu m), allowing mycorrhizal hyphae (but not roots) to pass through. Survival and growth were highest in stands of Nothofagus and lowest under Pseudotsuga. Surprisingly, root trenching and mesh treatments had no effect on seedling performance, indicating canopy tree species affected seedling performance through reduced light availability and altered soil conditions rather than below-ground suppression from root competition or mycorrhizal facilitation. Seedlings in Pseudotsuga stands had lower mycorrhizal colonisation, likely as a result of the lower light levels. Soil organic matter levels, microbial biomass, and abundance and diversity of microbe-consuming nematodes were all highest under Nothofagus, and nematode community assemblages differed strongly between native and non-native stand types. The negative effects of non-native trees on nematodes relative to Nothofagus are likely due to the lower availability of soil organic matter and microbial biomass in these stands, and therefore lower availability of resources for nematodes. This study shows that established stands of non-native invasive tree species may adversely affect tree seedlings and soil communities through modifications of the microenvironment both above and below ground. As such, invasion and domination of new landscapes by these species is likely to result in fundamental shifts in community- and ecosystem-level properties relative to those under native forest cover.

AB  - The growth rate and morphological characteristics of fine root systems are important both for nutrient absorption by trees and for material cycling in forest soil ecosystems. Interactions among soil organisms, such as fungi and fungivorous microarthropods, may be important in influencing tree fine root growth and morphology. We carried out a soil microarthropod depletion experiment using insecticide to assess the indirect effects of soil microarthropods on the growth and morphology of fine roots in a warm temperate forest dominated by the arbuscular mycorrhizal conifer Chamaecyparis obtusa. Insecticide application resulted in differences in hyphal. diameter, the number of small-sized spores and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal. (AMF) colonization, but did not affect fungal biomass. Community structures of collembola and oribatida were different among treatments, suggesting that the balance between arbuscular mycorrhizal and saprobic fungi may have been different among treatments. Insecticide application increased fine root growth and decreased specific root length (SRL). Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization rate (\% AM) was strongly correlated with fine root growth and SRL. Water contents correlated with fine root growth, SRL, and \% AM. These results suggest that soil microarthropods might indirectly affect soil water uptake by altering interactive functions between mycorrhizal fungi and fine roots of C. obtusa.

AB  - Tannins are plant-derived polyphenolic compounds that precipitate proteins, bind to metals and complex with other compounds. Solutions of tannic acid, or other phenolic compounds, were added to soil samples to determine if they would affect recovery of soluble soil carbon (WSC) or -nitrogen (WSN) or influence the extraction and composition of Bradford-reactive soil protein (BRSP), associated with glomalin. Tannic acid-C added with water was not completely recovered from samples and the amount of total net WSC and WSN recovered was reduced, suggesting formation of insoluble complexes. By comparison, non-tannin phenolics like gallic acid, or methyl gallate. had little effect on extraction of WSC or WSN while a simple gallotannin derived from tannic acid, 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-D-glucose (PGG), inhibited extraction most. The C and N concentrations in BRSP increased when soil samples were treated with tannic acid or PGG before extraction, a procedure that includes autoclaving. Increases were greatest in the 10-20 cm compared to 0-5 cm depth. Accompanying these were declines in the ratio of absorbance at 465 and 665 nm (E4/E6 ratio) of BRSP extracts suggesting formation of larger or heavier molecules. In contrast, C and N composition in lyophilized BRSP was unaffected or even slightly reduced when tannic acid or PGG were added to the BRSP extract solution after the extraction process. We conclude that some tannins can reduce the solubility of labile soil C and N, at least temporarily and given unpredictability of response associated with phenolic substances, the Bradford assay should not be relied on to quantify pools or composition of soil proteins like glomalin.

AB  - Beneficial soil microorganisms are integral to nutrient availability and uptake for plants in restoration. They include mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, together with the soil microbial populations which contribute to nutrient availability. Around 70\% of jarrah forest plant species form arbuscular mycorrhizas, and approximately a quarter also form ectomycorrttizas. Many are also legumes. In addition, around 70 orchid species depend on mycorrhizal symbioses. Therefore, symbiotic soil microorganisms are important in the ecosystem. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi recover to pre-mining levels in bauxite restoration in five years. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are poorly adapted to disturbance; however, they are able to reinvade through wind-blown spores. The density of ectomycorrhizal fungi has been found to be equivalent in seven-year-old restoration and adjacent forest, but both abundance and diversity are correlated with development of a litter layer. Fortunately, rhizobia are known to be tolerant of soil disturbance, and failure of N-fixation by legumes has not been reported in restoration. Other N-fixing symbioses, such as between Allocasuarina and Frankia or Macrozamia and Nostoc, have not been investigated in restored mines. Soil microbial biomass C achieves near equivalence after about eight years and appears to be driven by vegetation productivity and related inputs of C into the soil. There is little field evidence that the absence, or very low levels, of soil microbial symbionts will have a substantial impact on plant growth in restoration. Therefore, deliberate reintroduction of these microorganisms does not appear justified. However, soil management to enhance the survival of soil biological components is recommended.

AB  - Microinvertebrate abundance was measured, together with forest soil properties and litter components in eight plots dominated by beech and birch during May to August 2001. The results were analysed using ANOVA, stepwise regression and correlation analysis. Both protozoa and nematodes were analysed according to their functional groups. The protozoa were flagellates, ciliates and naked amoebae, and the nematodes were microbial and plant feeding nematodes. Moisture levels were between 28\% and 33\% in soil, and 50\% to 70\% in litter. Population numbers were very variable between sites and dates, and showed variable levels between May and July followed by a significant increase in August. ANOVA showed significant site and date effects, mainly in the litter. Stepwise regression models and correlation analysis revealed a number of interactions among separate groups of protozoa and nematodes, as well as their interrelations with fungi and bacteria. In addition, statistical analysis of soil data revealed a number of microfaunal relationships with soil pH, moisture and organic content, whilst in the field layer a number of significant interactions with specific forest litter fractions were found. The results have revealed particularly high levels of microfaunal abundance in the litter fraction compared to the soil, with flagellates and microbial feeding nematodes showing the highest levels among the trophic groups studied. These data compare well with other studies in similar ecosystems. The invertebrates present appear to be concentrated in hotspots of biological activity. In soil, they may predominantly have been confined to the rhizosphere. In the litter, their numbers may have been enhanced by nutrient availability, which may have increased throughout the study period owing to the gradual progress of decomposition facilitated by the combination of faunal, bacterial and fungal activity.

AB  - Soil organisms undertake every major ecosystem process, from primary production to decomposition to carbon sequestration, and those processes they catalyze have a bearing on the management of issues from agriculture to global climate change. Nonetheless, until recently, research to measure the dynamics of microscopic organisms living belowground has largely been limited to infrequent field sampling and laboratory extrapolation. Now, however, new sensor technologies can measure and monitor soil organisms and processes at rapid and continuous temporal scales. In this article, we describe these technologies and how they can be arrayed for an integrated view of soil dynamics.

AB  - Fungi play a central role in the nutrient cycles of boreal and temperate forests. In these biomes, the saprotrophic wood-decay fungi are the only organisms that can completely decompose woody plant litter. In particular, cord-forming basidiomycete fungi form extensive mycelial networks that scavenge scarce mineral nutrients and translocate them over long distances to exploit new food resources. Despite the importance of resource allocation, there is limited information on nutrient dynamics in these networks, particularly for nitrogen, as there is no suitable radioisotope available. We have mapped N-translocation using photon-counting scintillation imaging of the nonmetabolised amino acid analogue, C-14-aminoisobutyrate. We describe a number of novel phenomena, including rapid, preferential N-resource allocation to Grich sinks, induction of simultaneous bi-directional N-transport, abrupt switching between different pre-existing transport routes, and emergence of locally synchronised, oscillatory phase domains. It is possible that such self-organised oscillatory behaviour is a mechanism to achieve global co-ordination in the mycelium. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We have much to learn about the roles of various groups of soil microorganisms in the decomposition of soil organic matter. Any changes in the type or amount of organic matter entering the soil, due to increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition and elevated carbon dioxide, could directly affect soil microbial community structure or the decompositional functions performed by the various microbial groups. We experimentally altered soil microbial communities using a factorial combination of trenching and in-growth bags crossed with fertilization treatments consisting of two forms of inorganic N and three N-containing organic molecules of increasing molecular weight and complexity. We tested three hypotheses: (1) Different components of soil microbial communities change in different ways following the application of fertilization treatments; (2) soil fungi decrease with increased inorganic N but increase following the application of organic molecules; and (3) activity of the extracellular enzymes peroxidase and phenol oxidase, which are important in lignin degradation, decrease following the addition of inorganic N. We found that the abundance of soil microbes and their composition (measured by lipid analysis) was significantly altered following the addition of glutamic acid, but not with inorganic N or more complex N-containing organic molecules. Lipids indicative of ectomycorrhizat fungi experienced the greatest increase in abundance. Extracellular enzyme activity, in contrast, changed very little and did not parallel changes in the structure of the soil microbial community that resulted from the isolation treatments. We conclude that small additions of N-containing organic compounds can cause changes in the structure of the soil microbial community but that community changes do not necessarily have an impact on extracellular enzyme activity.

AB  - How resource availabilities affect the competitiveness of Canada bluejoint grass {[}Calamagrostis canadensis (Michx.) P. Beauv., hereafter referred to as bluejoint] is poorly understood. Bluejoint is a widespread grass species in boreal forests and competes with tree species such as white spruce {[}Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] for belowground resources (e.g., soil N and water) when their supply is limited. In this green house-based study, we tested the following hypotheses: (i) bluejoint competition reduces white spruce growth when belowground resource availabilities are limited; (ii) greater N and water availabilities may increase bluejoint competition and its adverse effects on white spruce growth; and (iii) white spruce foliar delta C-13 and delta N-15 are affected by soil N and water availabilities and bluejoint competition. A 2 x 2 x 2 (competition x N availability x water availability) factorial experiment was conducted using pots of planted white spruce seedlings with or without bluejoint. Bluejoint competition reduced the volume index (diameter(2) x height) of white spruce by 50\%. The competitiveness of bluejoint appeared to be independent of resource availabilities, but bluejoint had greater growth response to increased N availability than white spruce. Bluejoint competition depleted white spruce foliar delta C-13 and delta N-15 by 1.2 and 1.2\%o, respectively, even under adequate water supply, indicating that N deficiency caused by bluejoint competition had a C-13 discrimination during photosynthesis) compared with the potential effect of drought stress on foliar delta C-13, and that strong NH4 uptake by bluejoint may have prevented significant soil N losses and N-15 enrichment through nitrification and subsequent denitrification.

AB  - The development of stable isotope techniques is one of the main methodological advances in ecology of the last decades of the 20th century. Many biogeochemical processes are accompanied by changes in the ratio between stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (C-12/C-13 and N-14/N-15), which allows different ecosystem components and different ecosystems to be distinguished by their isotopic composition. Analysis of isotopic composition makes it possible to trace matter and energy flows through biological systems and to evaluate the rate of many ecological processes. The main concepts and methods of stable isotope ecology and patterns of stable isotope fractionation during organic matter decomposition are considered with special emphasis on the fractionation of isotopes in food chains and the use of stable isotope studies of trophic relationships between soil animals in the field.

AB  - The mechanisms behind the C-13 enrichment of organic matter with increasing soil depth in forests are unclear. To determine if C-13 discrimination during respiration could contribute to this pattern, we compared delta C-13 signatures of respired CO2 from sieved mineral soil, litter layer and litterfall with measurements of delta C-13 and delta N-15 of mineral soil, litter layer, litterfall, roots and fungal mycelia sampled from a 68-year-old Norway spruce forest stand planted on previously cultivated land. Because the land was subjected to ploughing before establishment of the forest stand, shifts in delta C-13 in the top 20 cm reflect processes that have been active since the beginning of the reforestation process. As C-13-depleted organic matter accumulated in the upper soil, a 1.0 parts per thousand delta C-13 gradient from -28.5 parts per thousand in the litter layer to -27.6 parts per thousand at a depth of 2-6 cm was formed. This can be explained by the 1 parts per thousand drop in delta C-13 of atmospheric CO2 since the beginning of reforestation together with the mixing of new C (forest) and old C (farmland). However, the isotopic change of the atmospheric CO2 explains only a portion of the additional 1.0 parts per thousand increase in delta C-13 below a depth of 20 cm. The delta C-13 of the respired CO2 was similar to that of the organic matter in the upper soil layers but became increasingly C-13 enriched with depth, up to 2.5 parts per thousand relative to the organic matter. We hypothesise that this C-13 enrichment of the CO2 as well as the residual increase in delta C-13 of the organic matter below a soil depth of 20 cm results from the increased contribution of C-13-enriched microbially derived C with depth. Our results suggest that C-13 discrimination during microbial respiration does not contribute to the C-13 enrichment of organic matter in soils. We therefore recommend that these results should be taken into consideration when natural variations in delta C-13 of respired CO2 are used to separate different components of soil respiration or ecosystem respiration.

AB  - The lipid composition of Collembola and their potential food resources was assessed in three deciduous forest stands, in order to gain insight into food web linkages under field conditions. Fatty acids (FAs) previously assigned as trophic markers in laboratory experiments were used to investigate feeding strategies in situ. As potential food sources soil microbiota and plant debris were characterised by their phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition. Both the amount and the pattern of PLFAs differed between sites and soil depth, in particular the bacterial and plant marker FAs in the upper soil layer. Thus, the availability of resources for micro-detritivores varied due to forest and soil layer. The lipid composition of vital and senescent beech leaves was predominantly influenced by metabolic status and represented a quite homogenous FA resource across forest stands. Comparing Folsomia quadrioculata, Lepidocyrtus lignorum, Neanura muscorum and Pogonognathellus longicornis between the different forests revealed FA profiles to be predominantly affected by site, suggesting a diet shift depending on resources at hand. However, species-specific differences in individual FAs occurred, likely related to feeding strategy and physiological activity. Lipids of Collembola comprised low amounts of bacterial marker FAs, and bacterial consumption may occur to some extent, particularly on Gram-positives. The marker FA for predatory feeding, 20: 1 omega 9, was found in several species, although in low amounts. This contradicts known feeding habits and caution is advisable in using 20: 1 omega 9 as trophic marker. Overall, as indicated by high proportions of oleic (18: 1 omega 9) or linoleic (18: 2 omega 6, 9) acid, most species were either plant litter or fungal feeders, with some transitions. The ratio 18: 1 omega 9/18: 2 omega 6,9 is proposed as a tool to distinguish between these two major feeding strategies in Collembola. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The methodologies used for studying macrofungal communities are an eclectic assemblage of many different and unstandardized approaches. In this study we propose a simple, nondestructive but still informative method to assess fungal sporocarp biomass in forested areas. We use the number of fruiting bodies found in the surveyed plot, and data on cap diameter of the species from the literature to calculate a cap area index. We show that this index very strongly correlates with the measured total dry mass of the species obtained from the same plot. We point out that the cap area index provides a more accurate estimation of the epigeous fungal sporocarp biomass than do the species sporocarp numbers. This new methodology allows the spatiotemporal distribution of a fungal community in an ecosystem to be followed. Since sporocarp production responds much more sensitively to environmental changes than does the fine-root vegetative ectomycorrhizal community, it may more quickly reflect whether an ecosystem has been perturbed. It will also allow us to collect data on saprotrophic species. A sporocarp survey can be useful for detecting early changes in the habitat and environment, and give an easily applicable method for conservation biology and ecosystem management.

AB  - Root respiration has been shown to increase with temperature, but less is known about how this relationship is affected by the fungal partner in mycorrhizal root systems. In order to test respiratory temperature dependence, in particular Q(10) of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal root systems, seedlings of Picea abies (L.) Karst. (Norway spruce) were inoculated with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Piloderma croceum (Eriksson and Hjortstam, SR430; synonym: Piloderma fallax: {[}Libert] Stalpers) and planted in soil respiration cuvettes (mycocosms). Temperature dependence of hyphal respiration in sterile cultures was determined and compared with respiration of mycorrhizal roots. Respiration rates of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal root systems as well as sterile cultures were sensitive to temperature. Q(10) of mycorrhizal root systems of 3.0 +/- 0.1 was significantly higher than that of non-mycorrhizal systems (2.5 +/- 0.2). Q(10) of P. croceum in sterile cultures (older than 2 months) was similar to that of mycorrhizal root systems, suggesting that mycorrhizae may have a large influence on the temperature sensitivity of roots in spite of their small biomass. Our results stress the importance of considering mycorrhization when modeling the temperature sensitivity of spruce roots.

AB  - Polyphenols are capable of binding to proteins and form polyphenol-protein complexes thus reducing the release of N from decomposing plant materials. The objective of this work was to test if under polyphenol-rich vegetations adapted microbial communities had developed capable of breaking down recalcitrant polyphenol-protein complexes. Soils used for this investigation were from different 10-year-old tropical agricultural systems (maize, sugarcane plots and Gliricidia sepium or Peltophorum dasyrrachis woodlots) and natural systems (secondary forest and Imperata cylindrica grassland). TA (tannic acid, hydrolysable tannin), QUE (quebracho, condensed tannin), BSA (bovine serum albumin, protein) or TA/BSA and QUE/BSA polyphenol-protein complexes were incubated at 28 degrees C in these soils. CO2-C and C-13 evolution were periodically monitored and mineral N release, microbial biomass N and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles measured at the end. QUE was able to bind about 25\% more protein than TA. In all systems the individual uncomplexed substrates were more easily degraded than the complexes. On average, net cumulative CO2-C evolution from TA/BSA complexes was more than 5 times higher than from QUE/BSA complexes, indicating higher C availability and/or lower protection capability of TA compared to QUE. However, net N release was higher from QUE/BSA than from TA/BSA probably due to their higher protein-binding capacity and associated larger degradation of partly unprotected protein as suggested by C-13-CO2 signatures. Microbial respiration patterns indicated that polyphenol complexes were initially degraded more quickly in the maize cropping system than in soils from under polyphenol-rich communities (Peltophorum and natural forest) but this pattern reversed with time. Long-term incubation of QUE/BSA complexes even caused a negative effect on microbial respiration in agricultural soils with low polyphenol contents (e.g. maize and sugarcane). Incubation of polyphenol complexes in soil depressed microbial biomass N in maize, sugarcane, Imperata and forest systems and led to reduced soil pH. However, microbial biomass was increased under the polyphenol-rich vegetation of Peltophorum. The PLFA group 18:2w6,9 was highly enhanced by condensed tannin-protein complexes additions as compared to control and hydrolysable polyphenol-protein complexes in soils with high polyphenol contents. Polyphenol complexes increased the fungi:bacteria ratio in systems with a high polyphenol content, particularly with condensed tannin complexes. The results indicated that systems with a high polyphenol content favoured development of fungal communities that are highly adaptable to phenol-rich soil conditions and high acidity, particularly with regards to the more recalcitrant condensed tannin-protein complexes.

AB  - The fungal community of the forest floor was examined as the cause of previously reported increases in soil organic matter due to experimental N deposition in ecosystems producing predominantly high-lignin litter, and the opposite response in ecosystems producing low-lignin litter. The mechanism proposed to explain this phenomenon was that white-rot basidiomycetes are more important in the degradation of high-lignin litter than of low-lignin litter, and that their activity is suppressed by N deposition. We found that forest floor mass in the low-lignin sugar-maple dominated system decreased in October due to experimental N deposition, whereas forest floor mass of high-lignin oak-dominated ecosystems was unaffected by N deposition. Increased relative abundance of basidiomycetes in high-lignin forest floor was confirmed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing. Abundance of basidiomycete laccase genes, encoding an enzyme used by white-rot basidiomycetes in the degradation of lignin, was 5-10 times greater in high-lignin forest floor than in low-lignin forest floor. While the differences between the fungal communities in different ecosystems were consistent with the proposed mechanism, no significant effects of N deposition were detected on DGGE profiles, laccase gene abundance, laccase length heterogeneity profiles, or phenol oxidase activity. Our observations indicate that the previously detected accumulation of soil organic matter in the high-lignin system may be driven by effects of N deposition on organisms in the mineral soil, rather than on organisms residing in the forest floor. However, studies of in situ gene expression and temporal and spatial variability within forest floor communities will be necessary to further relate the ecosystem dynamics of organic carbon to microbial communities and atmospheric N deposition.

AB  - The effects of varying doses of wood ash (2.5 and 5.0 t ha(-1)) and limestone (1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 t ha(-1)) on soil chemical properties and growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) transplants on an acidic forest soil were investigated in a reforestation area in eastern Finland. The ash and limestone were applied either on the soil surface or were mixed into the topsoil using disc ploughing. All the treatments were replicated three times. Soil samples were taken from the unploughed plots only. Wood ash and liming had reduced acidity in both the organic layer and 0-10 cm mineral soil layer for 15 years after application. The pH increase in the organic layer was 1.6 and 2.7 pH units on the plots treated with 2.5 and 5 t ha(-1) of ash, and 0.7, 1.0 and 1.7 units on the plots treated with 1, 2 and 4 t ha(-1) of lime, respectively. Depending on the dose, ash application resulted in a significant 41 to 47\% increase and liming 34 to 46\% increase in the base saturation of the organic layer. Surface broadcast of ash and lime significantly increased height growth. On the ash plots the mean height after 15 years was 24-27\% and on the limed plots 14-23\% greater than on the control plots. There were also signs of an increase in breast height diameter caused by ash application and liming. Liming or ash application after being mixed into the surface soil by ploughing had no effect on height growth of the pines, except for the highest lime dose. Instead, ploughing as such had a significant increasing effect both on survival and height growth of the trees.

AB  - A wood ash experiment was set up in a 38-year-old Scots pine stand (forest type - Pinetum vacciniosum) growing on Arenosol. Raw, dry ash (fly ash, not stabilized) and nitrogen fertilizers were applied in the forest. There were 6 variants of the experiment: 1-1.25 t ash ha(-1); 2-2.5 t ash ha(-1); 3-5.0 t ash ha(-1); 4-2.5 t ash ha(-1) and 180 kg N ha(-1); 5-180 kg N ha(-1) and 6-control (without ash and nitrogen). The primary effects (3 months-2 years after the treatment) of wood ash fertilization on soil, soil solution, soil microflora and biological activity, fine roots and mycorrhiza, ground vegetation diversity, tree foliage chemistry, physiological parameters and litterfall are presented in the paper. The highest wood ash dose (5.0 t ha(-1)) changed the chemistry of forest litter: the increased pH and total concentrations of most of the macronutrients were found after 2 years. In contrast, total N concentrations decreased due to ash application. Wood ash increased the number of ammonifying, denitrifying microorganisms and cellulose-decomposers in the forest litter 3 months after application. Wood ash slightly reduced total length of fine roots and number of root tips I year after treatment. The highest degree of fine roots vitality was found in the plots treated with 2.5-5.0 t ha(-1) of wood ash. No changes in ground vegetation diversity were found after the wood ash and N application. No changes of chlorophyll a, b were determined in the current year needles 5 months after application of wood ash. Wood ash decreased the content of the aminoacid proline and it has increased only after N addition.

AB  - A major uncertainty in predicting long-term ecosystem C balance is whether stimulation of net primary production will be sustained in future atmospheric CO2 scenarios. Immobilization of nutrients (N in particular) in plant biomass and soil organic matter (SOM) provides negative feedbacks to plant growth and may lead to progressive N limitation (PNL) of plant response to CO2 enrichment. Soil microbes mediate N availability to plants by controlling litter decomposition and N transformations as well as dominating biological N fixation. CO2-induced changes in C inputs, plant nutrient demand and water use efficiency often have interactive and contrasting effects on microbes and microbially mediated N processes. One critical question is whether CO2-induced N accumulation in plant biomass and SOM will result in N limitation of microbes and subsequently cause them to obtain N from alternative sources or to alter the ecosystem N balance. We reviewed the experimental results that examined elevated CO2 effects on microbial parameters, focusing on those published since 2000. These results in general show that increased C inputs dominate the CO2 impact on microbes, microbial activities and their subsequent controls over ecosystem N dynamics, potentially enhancing microbial N acquisition and ecosystem N retention. We reason that microbial mediation of N availability for plants under future CO2 scenarios will strongly depend on the initial ecosystem N status, and the nature and magnitude of external N inputs. Consequently, microbial processes that exert critical controls over long-term N availability for plants would be ecosystem-specific. The challenge remains to quantify CO2-induced changes in these processes, and to extrapolate the results from short-term studies with step-up CO2 increases to native ecosystems that are already experiencing gradual changes in the CO2 concentration.

AB  - Owing to the continuously increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2, it has become a priority to understand if soil organic matter (SOM) will behave as a sink or a source of CO2 under future environmental changes. Although many studies have addressed this question, a clear understanding is still missing, particularly with respect to long-term responses. In this study, we quantified soil C stores and dynamics in relationship to soil aggregation and pool composition in a Californian chaparral ecosystem exposed for 6 years to a gradient of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, ranging from pre-industrial levels 250 to 750 mu l l(-1) CO2. Fossil fuel-derived CO2 depleted in C-13 was used for the fumigation, thus providing a tracer of C input from the vegetation to the soil. Long-term CO2 exposure invariably affected soil aggregation, with a significant decrease in the macroaggregate fraction at highest CO2 levels relative to the other two size fractions (i.e. microaggregates and silt and clay). This soil structural change most likely reduced the stability and protection of SOM, and C content generally decreased in most fractions over the CO2 treatments, and induced faster turnover of recently fixed C at high CO2 levels. The strongest response was found in the C content of the microaggregates, which decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with rising levels of CO2. We conclude that increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations will decrease soil C in chaparral ecosystems, and that the microaggregate fraction is the most responsive to increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2.

AB  - Stable isotope analysis is a powerful tool in the study of soil organic matter formation. It is often observed that more decomposed soil organic matter is C-13, and especially N-15-enriched relative to fresh litter and recent organic matter. We investigated whether this shift in isotope composition relates to the isotope composition of the microbial biomass, an important source for soil organic matter. We developed a new approach to determine the natural abundance C and N isotope composition of the microbial biomass across a broad range of soil types, vegetation, and climates. We found consistently that the soil microbial biomass was N-15-enriched relative to the total (3.2 parts per thousand) and extractable N pools (3.7 parts per thousand), and C-13-enriched relative to the extractable C pool (2.5 parts per thousand). The microbial biomass was also C-13-enriched relative to total C for soils that exhibited a C3-plant signature (1.6 parts per thousand), but C-13-depleted for soils with a C4 signature (-1.1 parts per thousand). The latter was probably associated with an increase of annual C3 forbs in C4 grasslands after an extreme drought. These findings are in agreement with the proposed contribution of microbial products to the stabilized soil organic matter and may help explain the shift in isotope composition during soil organic matter formation.

AB  - Soil respiration almost balances carbon fixation by terrestrial photosynthesis and exceeds all anthropogenic carbon emissions by an order of magnitude, yet we lack precise knowledge of the sources of, and controls upon, the release of carbon dioxide from soils. Here, we discuss the increasing evidence that half of this carbon release is from living plant roots, their mycorrhizal fungi and other root-associated microbes, and that this release is driven directly by recent photosynthesis. The new studies challenge the widespread view that soil activity is dominated by decomposer organisms using older detrital material and that root litter inputs equal those of aboveground litter. The new observations emphasize the physiological continuity and dynamic interdependence of the plant-microbe-soil system and highlight the need for closer cooperation between plant and soil scientists.

AB  - We analysed by an optical method (the small volume method) the composition and the vertical distribution of an organic soil which accumulated over an old petroleum tar deposit. The study site was an oil refinery now colonised by woody vegetation since the time of abandonment (1964), located at Merkwiller-Pechelbronn (Alsace, France). Comparisons were done with a nearby unpolluted control plot under similar vegetation. The humus form over the tar deposit was described as an Hemimoder. It was characterised by fine fragmentation of litter, darkening of tree leaves with depth and a dense mycelial mat associated with an ectomycorrhizal root system. Faunal activity was dominated by enchytraeids. The Mesomull described at the control plot was characterized by fast recycling of litter and earthworm activity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The species-specific microbial root and rhizosphere colonization contributes essentially to the plant nutrient supply. The species number and colonization densities of cultivable saprotrophic microfungi and the activities of nutrient-releasing soil enzymes (protease, acid and alkaline phosphatase, arylsulfatase) were investigated in the rhizosphere of one low mycorrhizal (Salix viminalis) and one higher mycorrhizal (S. x dasyclados) willow clone at a Eutric Cambisol in N Germany. After soil washing, in total 32 and 28 saprotrophic microfungal species were isolated and identified microscopically from the rhizosphere of S. viminalis and S. x dasyclados, respectively. The fungal species composition changed within the growing season but the species number was always lower under S. x dasyclados than under S. viminalls. Under both willow clones, the fungal colonization density was largest in spring, and the species number was largest in autumn. Acid-phosphatase activity (p < 0.001) and protease activity (p < 0.003) were significantly affected by the Salix clone, whereas arylsulfatase and alkaline-phosphatase activities did not show clone-specific differences. All enzyme activities reached their maxima in the summer sampling. Rhizosphere colonization with Acremonium butyri, Cladosporium herbarum, and Penicillium janthinellum contributed significantly to explain the activities of acid phosphatase. Rhizosphere colonization with Cylindro-carpon destructans, Penicillium, spinulosum, Plectosphaerella cucumerina, and Trichoderma polysporum contributed significantly to explain the arylsulfatase activities. Effects of the saprotrophic fungal colonization densities on the protease activities in the rhizosphere were low. Acid- and alkaline-phosphatase and arylsulfatase activities in the rhizosphere soil were stronger affected by the composition of the saprotrophic fungal communities than by the Salix clone itself. In conclusion, the colonization density of some saprotrophic microfungi in the rhizosphere contributed to explain shifts in soil-enzyme activities of the P and S cycles under different willow clones.

AB  - The effect of high nitrogen (N) depositions on forest ecosystems is an important concern in North America and may lead to N saturation of forest ecosystems and contribute to soils and surface water acidification. In this study, nitrogen dynamics in the FH layers of a sugar maple (SM), a balsam fir (1317) and a black spruce (BS) forest was characterized using a short term 15 N isotopic pool dilutions approach and mid-term FH material incubation both in situ and in the laboratory. The short term dilutions approach indicated that the mean residence times of NH4+ and NO3- in the FH material of the three sites were low (< 1d). The amount of inorganic nitrogen (NH4+ + NO3-) recycled annually within the exchangeable forest floor reservoir was between one and two orders of magnitude larger than the annual atmospheric N deposition found at each of the sites. The BS site was clearly distinct than the two other forest types in that net N mineralization was negligible, even in absence of root uptake, suggesting that soil microorganisms were severely N limited. While net nitrification was not observed within the FH material of the BF site, NO3- did accumulate in the FH of the SM despite a low pH of 3.72 presumably because of heterotrophic nitrification or as a result of acid-tolerant autotrophic nitrification. The difference in N dynamics between the sites were most probably caused by dominant tree species. Transformation rates of inorganic N were higher in SM, followed by BF and BS stands. Given that the potential to mineralize inorganic N matches with a superimposed N atmospheric deposition gradient in Quebec, the sugar maple forest is more likely to be affected by N saturation than coniferous forests.

AB  - Belowground communities usually support a much greater diversity of organisms than do corresponding aboveground ones, and while the factors that regulate their diversity are far less well understood, a growing number of recent studies have presented data relevant to understanding how these factors operate. This review considers how biotic factors influence community diversity within major groups of soil organisms across a broad spectrum of spatial scales, and addresses the mechanisms involved. At the most local scale, soil biodiversity may potentially be affected by interactions within trophic levels or by direct trophic interactions. Within the soil, larger bodied invertebrates can also influence diversity of smaller sized organisms by promoting dispersal and through modification of the soil habitat. At larger scales, individual plant species effects, vegetation composition, plant species diversity, mixing of plant litter types, and aboveground trophic interactions, all impact on soil biodiversity. Further, at the landscape scale, soil diversity also responds to vegetation change and succession. This review also considers how a conceptual understanding of the biotic drivers of soil biodiversity may assist our knowledge of key topics in community and ecosystem ecology, such as aboveground-belowground interactions, and the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It is concluded that an improved understanding of what drives the diversity of life in the soil, incorporated within appropriate conceptual frameworks, should significantly aid our understanding of the structure and functioning of terrestrial communities.

AB  - Allelopathy has been implicated as a factor contributing toward failure of black spruce (Picea mariana) regeneration in Kalmia angustifolia-dominated sites in eastern Canada. Several phenolic acids of Kalmia origin inhibit primary root growth of black spruce. We tested the hypothesis that some well-adapted conifer ectomycorrhizae can degrade and detoxify water-soluble phenolic compounds produced by Kalmia and use the degraded products as a carbon source to stimulate growth. We found that hyphal growth of Paxillus involutus, a common ectomycorrhizal fungus of black spruce, was stimulated by water leachates of Kalmia leaf and litter. An equimolar mixture of three phenolic acids (ferulic, o-coumaric, and o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid), commonly found in Kalmia, had no negative effects on fungal growth at 1 mM concentration. The o-hydroxyphenylacetic (o-HPA) acid, which is known to be toxic to black spruce, was found to stimulate the growth of Laccaria laccata, L. bicolor, and P. involutus (isolates 211804 and 196554) by 38.4, 29.3, 25.0, and 18.9\%, respectively, at 1 mM. Pure ferulic, o-coumaric, and o-HPA acids were degraded by 100, 98, and 79.5\%, respectively, within 10 d in the presence of P. involutus 211804. However, L. laccata could not tolerate high concentrations of the Kalmia leachates. P. involutus and L. bicolor used o-HPA acid as a carbon source when cultured in noncarbon nutrient medium. The 0.5 and 0.2 mM o-HPA acid inhibited the root growth of black spruce. However, after solutions had been exposed to a culture of P. involutus, they had no significant effect on seedling growth of black spruce. We concluded that some ectomycorrhizal fungi, such as P. involutus and L. bicolor, are able to degrade Kalmia phenolics. Our findings point to a mechanism by which ectomycorrhizal species can control species interactions in higher plants by changing the rhizosphere chemistry.

AB  - The effect of autumn application of urea on the activity and composition of saprotrophic fungi associated with sour cherry (Prunus cerasus) leaf litter infected with the leaf spot pathogen, Blumeriella jaapii, was studied under orchard conditions from the time of leaf fall to the release of ascospores, the following spring. The ability of treatment of infected leaves post leaf fall with urea or with inoculum of selected fungal strains to reduce primary inoculum (ascospores and winter conidia) of B. jaapii in spring was evaluated. Fungal activity was measured enzymatically by quantifying beta-N-acetylgly-cosaminidase and fungal composition and frequency were evaluated following isolation at low temperature of mycelia embedded in leaf particles. Activity of the general fungal flora increased in both the urea and water treatments throughout the experimental period and a significantly higher level of activity was detected in urea-treated leaves up to 79 days after treatment. Most of the 2,146 fungal isolates recovered from the leaf litter during November-May could be placed in the following six groups: Phoma macrostoma (52.7\%), other Phoma spp. (12.3\%), Cladosporium. spp. (13.8\%), Alternaria and Ulocladium spp. (5.4\%), Epicoccum. purpurascens (2.9\%) and Fusarium. spp. (1.6\%). These groups were isolated from the leaf litter throughout the experimental period and the effect of urea on fungal composition in the litter was very limited. Of these groups only the frequency of recovery of E. purpurascens was higher from urea than from water-treated leaves and this significant difference was maintained throughout the 115 days of the experimental period. Phoma macrostoma var. macrostoma, Cladosporium. sp., Ulocladium chatarum, Epicoccum purpurascens and Fusarium lateritium var. lateritium were evaluated and compared with urea to reduce primary inoculum of B. jaapii. Urea reduced primary inoculum of B. jaapii in the spring by 77\% and of the fungal strains, especially Cladosporium strain MB167 was found to be equally effective.

AB  - We assessed the effects of changes in the plant community and belowground soil ecosystem in a mountain meadow, from the invasion of leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) and Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense L.), and the subsequent management efforts to remove them. Sampling included three paired sites containing areas where herbicides and mechanical means had been employed and which were still dominated by leafy spurge, and areas where herbicides had not been applied and where very little (< 0.03\%) or no leafy spurge or Canada thistle existed. Plant species diversity, frequency, and percent cover were estimated. Decomposition rates were assessed by use of litterbags placed on the sites and retrieved after I year. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculum potential was used as an index for mutualistic associations. Soil microarthropod densities were used as an index for the detrital food web. Significantly greater (P <= 0.05) richness of plant species and significantly higher percent relative cover of herbs, sedges, lichen, moss, and fallen litter was found on non-invasive plots compared to plots with invasive species. Plots where herbicides had been applied, and which still possessed leafy spurge, showed a significantly higher percentage of bare ground. Mycorrhizal inoculum potential did not differ between plots. Overall soil arthropod densities and densities of specific suborders of Acari were significantly lower (P <= 0.05) in invasive species plots. There was no significant difference in decomposition rates between non-invasive and invasive plots, but there were site differences in losses of lignin, phosphorus, and trace elements from litter placed on invasive and non-invasive plots. When differences were observed, loss rates were always less in invasive plots. Our results indicate that the establishment of leafy spurge and Canada thistle and the subsequent management practices to control them has altered the plant community structure by facilitating the establishment of other exotic species, which has resulted in a change in the composition and functioning of the belowground community.

AB  - Previous research on the effects of tree species on soil processes has focused primarily on the role of leaf litter inputs. We quantified the extent to which arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree species influence soil microbial activity and nutrient availability through rhizosphere effects. Rhizosphere soil, bulk soil and fine roots were collected front 12 monospecife plots (six AM and six ECM tree species) planted on a common soil at the Turkey Hill Plantations in Dryden, New York. Rhizosphere effects were estimated by the percentage difference between rhizosphere and bulk soil samples for several assays. Rhizosphere effects on soil microbes and their activities were significant for ECM species but in only a few cases for AM species. In AM tree species, microbial biomass, net N mineralization, and phosphatase enzyme activity in the rhizosphere were 10-12\% greater than in bulk soil. In ECM tree species, rhizosphere effects for microbial biomass, C mineralization rates, net N mineralization, and phosphatase activity were 25-30\% greater than bulk soil, and significantly greater than AM rhizosphere effects. The magnitude of rhizosphere effects was negatively correlated with the degree of mycorrhizal colonization in AM tree species (r = -0.83) and with fine root biomass (r = -0.88) in ECM tree species, suggesting that different factors influence rhizosphere effects in tree species forming different mycorrhizal associations. Rhizosphere effects on net N mineralization and phosphatase activity were also much greater in soils with pH < 4.3 for both AM and ECM tree species, suggesting that. soil pH and its relation to nutrient availability may also influence the magnitude of rhizosphere effects. Our results support the idea that tree roots stimulate nutrient availability in the rhizosphere, and that systematic differences between AM and ECM may result in distinctive rhizosphere effects for C, N, and P cycling between AM and ECM tree species.

AB  - Changes in nutrient inputs due to aboveground herbivory may influence the litter and soil microbial community responsible for processes such as decomposition. The mesophyll-feeding scale insect (Matsucoccus acalyptus) found near Sunset Crater National Monument in northern Arizona, USA significantly increases pinon (Pinus edulis) needle litter nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations by 50\%, as well as litter inputs to soil by 21\%. Because increases in needle litter quality and quantity of this magnitude should affect the microbial communities responsible for decomposition, we tested the hypothesis that insect herbivory causes a shift in soil microbial and litter microarthropod function. Four major findings result from this research: (1) Despite increases in needle inputs due to herbivory, soil carbon (C) was 56\% lower beneath scale-susceptible trees than beneath resistant trees; however, soil moisture, N, and pH were similar among treatments. (2) Microbial biomass was 80\% lower in soils beneath scale-susceptible trees when compared to resistant trees in the dry season, while microbial enzyme activities were lower beneath susceptible trees in the wet season. (3) Bacterial community-level physiological profiles differed significantly between susceptible and resistant trees during the dry season but not during the wet season. (4) There was a 40\% increase in Oribatida and 23\% increase in Prostigmata in susceptible needle litter relative to resistant litter. Despite these changes, the magnitude of microbial biomass, activity, and community structure response to herbivory was lower than expected and appears to take a long time to develop. These results suggest that herbivores impact soils in subtle, but important ways; we suggest that while litter chemistry may strongly mediate soil fertility and microbial communities in mesic ecosystems, the influence is lower than expected in this primary succession xeric ecosystem where season mediates differences in microbial populations. Understanding how insect herbivores alter the distribution of susceptible and resistant trees and their associated decomposer communities in and environments may lead to better prediction of how these ecosystems respond to climatic change.

AB  - The composition of forest litter and understorey layer, and fungal biomass (in terms of ergosterol) were measured in eight subplots over a winter-spring period (January to April). The sampling site was positioned in a range of woodland habitats (variously dominated by beech, Fagus sylvatica; birch, Betula pendula x pubescens, and oak Quercus petraea) and a clear area covered with grass (dominated by Holcus lanatus). The results were analysed together with data on bacteria and microinvertebrates available from parallel research. Levels of ergosterol in individual subplots ranged between 50 and 160 mu g g(-1) DW. Fungal biomass decreased in March, and then increased significantly in April. Stepwise regression models for ergosterol indicated positive relationships with moisture content (February), bacteria (all but February and March), flagellates (February) and plant-feeding nematodes and flies (January, overall). The relationships with roots, seeds, the collective variable `other microinvertebrates' (all March), amoebae (February) and fragments (March, overall) were negative, while the relationship between fungi- and microbial-feeding nematodes changed sign between February (-) and March (+). Results of analysis of covariance for fungal ergosterol were significant only for January and the combined dataset. In January, fungi were shown to be significantly related to amoebae, bacteria and a collembolan Folsomia candida, while the only significant predictor returned by the overall model was bacteria. Correlation analysis confirmed some effects already noted, and revealed a number of further interactions. The results highlighted the complexity of factors influencing temporal dynamics and spatial variability of fungal biomass in forest litter. Most of the registered interactions appeared to be transient, and this should be taken into account while interpreting environmental observations. Interpretation of the specific relationships is given and implications for further research and overall ecosystem functioning are discussed.

AB  - Established vegetation can facilitate the ectomycorrhizal infection of seedlings, but it is not known whether this interaction is limited by the phylogenetic relatedness of trees and seedlings. We use a series of bioassay experiments to test whether soil modification by different ectomycorrhizal tree species causes different levels of seedling infection, whether the extent of seedling infection is a function of the relatedness of tree and seedling, and whether the effect of trees on seedlings is mediated by biotic or abiotic soil factors. We found that soils from under different tree species do vary in their mycorrhizal infectiveness. However, this variation is not related to the genetic relatedness of trees and seedlings but instead, appears to be an attribute of the overstory species, irrespective of seedling species, mediated through a suite of humus- and base-cation-related abiotic effects on soils. Modification of abiotic soil properties by overstory trees should be considered as an important factor in the effect of different overstory trees on the extent of seedling mycorrhizal infection.

AB  - The spatial distribution of basidiocarps of the ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycete Russula subsect. Foetentinae was assessed in a primary forest in the Western Ghats (India) dominated by the ectomycorrhizal tree species Vateria indica and Dipterocarpus indicus. Over a 7,700-m(2) sampling area, both trees and basidiocarps of Russula subsect. Foetentinae were mapped during the first month of the 2002 rainy season. First-order spatial analysis revealed that the distribution of the 45 collected carpophores was highly aggregated, with 60\% of all basidiocarps located at a distance lower than 1 m from the nearest one. The genetic structure of the Russula subsect. Foetentinae population was studied by inter-simple sequence repeat polymorphism analysis using three primers. Eighteen of the 45 genotypes were represented by single basidiocarps. Twenty-seven basidiocarps were identified as belonging to 11 genets or separated ramets. Five genets were small, with diameters ranging from 0.5 to 5 m. The six others were large, with a diameter ranging from 31 m to a maximum measured distance of 70 m. In spite of the lack of data concerning the reproductive biology of this species, the presence of large genets suggests that mature stands may shelter well-spread underground mycelium, crucial for durable interaction with plant partner.

AB  - Different fractions of soil organic matter (SOM) may contribute to varying degrees to phosphorus (P) recycling and supply. This study investigated the potential for light fraction SOM to contribute to plant P nutrition using a bioassay with Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.) seedlings. Light fraction SOM, which has been subject to only limited decomposition, was isolated from bulk soil using a density floatation procedure. Seedlings were grown in sand with a P-free nutrient solution and either light fraction SOM from five different native eucalypt forest plots as a source of added P or in sand with no added light SOM (controls). Growth (dry matter accumulation) and P acquisition by seedlings of four of the treatments grown with light fraction organic matter was 2-3 times greater than that of control seedlings. Daily rates of P acquisition ranged from 0.13 mu g P day(-1) (control) to 0.29-0.50 mu g P day(-1) for seedlings grown with added organic matter. Whilst the study indicates that light fraction SOM can contribute to the P nutrition of eucalypt seedlings, accordingly, further research into the nutritional role of light fraction SOM is warranted.

AB  - The distribution and persistence of water repellence was altered by low severity. re and subsequent rain in soil supporting eucalypt woodland on sandstone terrain in Sydney, south-eastern Australia. Water drop penetration times were recorded to depths of 0.08 m in situ 9 months before the experimental. re, immediately after. re, 4 weeks later when rainfall had modified the soil surface but the soil was dry, and 5 weeks after the. re when the soil was moist. Spatial variation in water repellence was high in all cases except immediately after the. re, when soil was almost uniformly strongly repellent to 0.03 m depth, and less uniformly repellent at 0.04 - 0.06 m depth. Heavy rain moved litter, ash, and mineral soil, modifying the soil surface into microtopographic units including litter dams, microterraces, and other areas with differing proportions of litter, bare soil, and gravel. Post-rain water drop penetration measurements were taken on and beneath these different surface conditions, in order to investigate the possible contribution of water repellence to the formation and maintenance of litter dams and microterraces characteristic of this terrain after. re. Water repellence did not appear to be directly correlated with the presence or absence of surface litter. Results suggest the long-term and spatially variable water repellence found in soils associated with vegetation dominated by eucalypts in Australia is maintained by factors different from those causing extreme and uniform water repellence after. re. Variable water repellence at the soil surface and within the pro. le may contribute to differential survival of seedlings after. re. The possible breakdown of water repellent compounds formed after. re and the distribution and development of hydrophobic biotic structures including fungal hyphae and proteoid roots need to be investigated.

AB  - Ecologists have tried to link plant species composition and ecosystem properties since the inception of the ecosystem concept in ecology. Many have observed that biological communities could feed back to, and not simply result from, soil properties. But which group of organisms, plants or microorganisms, drive those feedback systems? Recent research asserts that soil microorganisms preclude plant species feedback to soil nitrogen (N) transformations due to strong microbial control of soil N cycling. It has been well documented that litter properties influence soil N cycling. In this review, we stress that under many circumstances plant species exert a major influence over soil N cycling rates via unique N attainment strategies, thus influencing soil N availability and their own fitness. We offer two testable mechanisms by which plants impart active control on the N cycle and thereby allow for plant-litter-soil-plant feedback. Finally, we describe the characteristics of plants and ecosystems that are most likely to exhibit feedback.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal mycelia are the main organs for nutrient uptake in many woody plants, and often connect seedlings to mature trees. While it is known that resources are shared among connected plants via common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs), the net effects of CMNs on seedling performance in the field are almost unknown. CMNs of individual ECM fungal species were produced in an early succession volcanic desert by transplanting current-year seedlings of Salix reinii with ECM mother trees that had been inoculated with one of 11 dominant ECM fungal species. Most seedlings were connected to individual CMNs without being infected by other ECM fungi. Although control seedlings showed poor growth under severe nutrient competition with larger nonmycorrhizal mother trees, nutrient acquisition and growth of seedlings connected to CMNs were improved with most fungal species. The positive effects of CMNs on seedling performance were significantly different among ECM fungal species; for example, the maximum difference in seedling nitrogen acquisition was 1 : 5.9. The net effects of individual CMNs in the field and interspecific variation among ECM fungal species are shown.

AB  - The addition of leaf litter to soil influences both the nutrients and polyphenols of soil. It is likely that contrasting nutrient and polyphenolic composition of different plant litters may affect plant growth, mycorrhizal and soil arthropod communities. We report results from a microcosm experiment of effects of incorporation of three single leaf litter species and a mixture of all three on pitch pine seedling growth, their ectomycorthizal community and soil arthropod community. The three litter species (pine, oak and huckleberry) represent co-dominant species within the New Jersey pine barrens ecosystem. We show that the leaf litters have different composition of nutrients and polyphenols, with rooting matrix containing pine litter having lower inorganic nitrogen content (1.6 mu g g(-1)) than oak (19.9 mu g g(-1)) and huckleberry (4.4 mu g g(-1)), but oak litter having the highest extractable phosphorus (13.3 cf. 0 - 0.08 mu g g(-1)) and total phenol content and lowest condensed tannin content. These differences were imparted to rooting matrix of homogenized humic (Oa) layer of pine barrens soil to which milled leaf litter was added and used in the microcosms. Pitch pine seedlings grew significantly better in un-amended rooting matrix (0.33 +/- 0.02 g) than any of the litter treatments (0.15 +/- 0.02 - 0.17 +/- 0.01 g) and tissue P concentrations tracked phosphate concentrations in the rooting matrix. Total P accumulation into plant tissue was higher in oak than control, attributable to a significantly higher (P < 0.05) accumulation in roots (3.3 +/- 0.19 mg g(-1)) compared to other species (1.1 +/- 0.04 - 2.3 +/- 0.08 mg g(-1)). No relationship was seen between tissue N concentration and soil N, but seedlings growing in huckleberry litter amended soil accumulated less N than control. The effect of leaf litters on the ectomycorrhizal community composition were determined by PCA (first two axes accounted for 81\% of the variance) and stepwise multiple regression analysis. These analyses showed that huckleberry leaf litter had a significant impact on mycorrhizal community composition with morphotypes Cg and DB being more abundant in the presence of huckleberry litter (178 +/- 13 cf. 68 +/- 15 - 106 +/- 15 for Cg and 141 +/- 11 cf. 88 +/- 23 - 111 +/- 18 for DB) and its influence of elevating nitrate nitrogen, organic nitrogen, total phenols and protein precipitation content of the rooting matrix. Mycorrhizal morphotypes BS and SB were significantly more abundant in the community where these soil factors were low in the absence of leaf litter addition. Total ectomycorrhizal abundance was negatively related to hydrolysable tannin concentration in the rooting matrix (r(2) = 0.132, P < 0.05). There was no influence of leaf litter type on mite density (dominated by nonburrowing phthiracarids), but collembolan density (dominated by Folsomia spp) showed a greater than threefold reduction in population density in the presence of leaf litter (F = 6.47, P < 0.05). Collembolan density was positively correlated with mycorrhizal morphotypes GS and SB (P < 0.05) and negatively related to morphotypes DB (P < 0.05) and soil extractable NH4-N (P < 0.05), suggesting a possible selection of fungal species in their diet and a relationship between collembola and nitrification.

AB  - Molecular methods were used to test the hypothesis that severe infection by dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium, a carbon-sink parasite) affects the ectomycorrhizal (EM) communities of its host, lodgepole pine. Results indicate significantly lower EM fungal species richness (2 +/- 0.2 SE species per core in uninfected and 1 +/- 0.2 species per core in infected blocks; P < 0.005), Shannon-Wiener diversity indices (1.1 in uninfected and 0.6 in infected; P < 0.05), and also differences in species EM fungal composition; uninfected blocks are dominated by a species of Cortinarius while the infected stand is dominated by species of Russula, and Piloderma (26\%). By contrast, dwarf mistletoe infection has no apparent effect on evenness (0.65 in controls and 0.47 in infected; 0.05 < P < 0.1), or on EM infection levels (35 +/- 7 EM tips per core in uninfected and 21 +/- 5 in infected; P > 0.1). Thus, dwarf mistletoe infection may select for EM fungal species that impose a lower carbon demand on the host, or that possess carbon-degrading abilities to augment carbon lost to the parasite, enabling the trees in infected blocks to maintain relatively high EM infection levels. Our results indicate that effects of dwarf mistletoe infection occur not just in the crown of infected but extend into the soil as well, and hence may have much greater implications for ecosystem function than previously thought.

AB  - The variety and galaxy of fungi and their natural beauty occupy prime place in the biological world and India has been the cradle for such fungi. Only a fraction of total fungal wealth has been subjected to scientific scrutiny and mycologists have to unravel the unexplored and hidden wealth. One third of fungal diversity of the globe exists in India. Out of 1.5 million of fungi, only 50\% are characterized until now. Unfortunately, only around 5-10\% of fungi can be cultured artificially, Fungi are not only beautiful but play a significant role in the daily life of human beings besides their utilization in industry, agriculture, medicine, food industry, textiles, bioremediation, natural cycling, as biofertilizers and many other ways. Fungal biotechnology has become an integral part of the human welfare.

AB  - We determined whether Pinus resinosa, selected ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic microfungi have access to various organic nitrogen sources commonly found in the forest. Vector analysis demonstrated nitrogen limitation of the P. resinosa in the plantation from which most of the fungi were isolated, establishing this study's relevance. Nonmycorrhizal P. resinosa seedlings did not absorb significant N from amino acids. The ectomycorrhizal fungi, including Pisolithus tinctorius, Suillus intermedius and Tylopilus felleus, obtained substantial N from amino acids, a limited amount of N from glucosamine, and essentially no N from protein-tannin complex. In contrast, Penicillium and Trichoderma readily acquired N from protein-tannin and glucosamine. Thus, there was an increasing ability to obtain N from complex organic N sources from plant to ectomycorrhizal fungi to saprotrophic fungi. Furthermore, N mineralization from an organic N source by Penicillium depended on the C:N ratio. We conclude that acquisition of relatively simple organic N sources by P. resinosa is likely to be largely indirect via ectomycorrhizal fungi, and that more complex organic N sources may become accessible to ectomycorrhizal fungi (and thus possibly their host plants) following mineralization by saprotrophic fungi such as Penicillium or Trichoderma when C:N ratios are sufficiently low.

AB  - By assessing current leaf litter nutrient dynamics, we may be able to predict responses of nutrient cycling in tropical ecosystems to future environmental change. The goal of this study was to assess whether nutrient cycling is related to seasonal variation in rainfall in a wet tropical forest. We examined leaf litter of an old-growth tropical rain forest in N.E. Costa Rica over a 4-year period to explore seasonal and inter-annual changes in leaf litter nutrient concentrations, and to evaluate potential short- and long-term drivers of variation in litter nutrient concentration, particularly that of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N). We also examined the temporal dynamics of calcium, potassium, and magnesium in the leaf litter. Leaf litter {[}P] and \%N changed significantly with time, both seasonally and inter-annually. Seasonal changes in leaf litter {[}P] were strongly positively correlated with rainfall from the previous 2 weeks; cations, however, were inversely related to this measure of current rainfall, while \%N was not related to rainfall. We propose that the positive relationship between current rainfall and leaf litter {[}P] is due to a response by the vegetation to an increase in nutrient availability and uptake. In contrast, given the negative relationship between current rainfall and cation concentrations, leaching from live leaf tissue is a more likely driver of short-term changes in cations. Should global climate change include altered rainfall patterns in this biome, one class of ecosystem-level responses could be significant changes in P and cation cycling.

AB  - Hydroponic studies suggest that plant nitrogen M demand determines the rate of mineral N uptake; however, field observations show N limitation to be widespread. Field experiments are needed to understand soil factors controlling mineral N uptake. We planted Picea engelmannii seedlings that had initially been grown from sterilized seeds, on a recently clearcut site. We applied a hybrid isotope dilution/pulse labelling technique to compare the gross production rate, concomitantly to the plant uptake rate, of soil mineral N. We also measured mineral N concentrations, microbial N, and percent ectomycorrhizal root tips. Gross NH4+ production rate was the most important determinant of plant uptake rate. Exploratory path analysis suggested that plant uptake was also determined by microbial N, which was, in turn, determined by soil mineral N concentrations. Percent ectomycorrhizal root tips was negatively related to gross NO3- production rate and microbial N concentrations. We conclude that nutrient flux density is important in controlling plant uptake. Mycorrhizal colonization may alter N dynamics in the rhizosphere without affecting mineral N uptake by seedlings.

AB  - Soil C fluxes were measured in a northern hardwood forest ecosystem at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest to provide insights into the C balance of soils at this long-term study site. Soil CO2 emission (F-CO2) was estimated using a univariate exponential model as a function of soil temperature based on 23 measurement dates over 5 years. Annual F-CO2 for the undisturbed northern hardwood forest was estimated at 660 +/- 54 g C(.)m(-2.)year(-1). Low soil moisture significantly reduced F-CO2 on three of the measurement dates. The proportion of F-CO2 derived from the forest floor horizons was estimated empirically to be about 58\%. We estimated that respiration of root tissues contributed about 40\% of F-CO2, with a higher proportion for mineral soil (46\%) than for forest floor (35\%). Soil C-balance calculations, based upon evidence that major soil C pools are near steady state at this site, indicated a large C flux associated with root exudation plus allocation to mycorrhizal fungi (80 g C(.)m(-2.)year(-1), or 17\% of total root C allocation); however, uncertainty in this estimate is high owing especially to high error bounds for root respiration flux. The estimated proportion of F-CO2 associated with autotrophic activity (52\%) was comparable with that reported elsewhere (56\%).

AB  - We examined the impact of soil stress (low water and nutrient availabilities) and two keystone insect herbivores on pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) needle litterfall. We compared trees growing on two distinct soil types: volcanic cinders, which exhibit pronounced water and nutrient limitation, and sandy-loam soils, which have higher water-storage capacity and nutrient availability. Using two long-term herbivore removal experiments (15 and 18 years, respectively), we also examined the effects of the pinyon needle scale (Matsucoccus acalyptus, which attacks juvenile trees) and the stem-boring moth (Dioryctria albovittella, which attacks mature trees) on pinyon litterfall. These herbivores reach high densities on cinder soils but are absent or occur at much lower levels on sandy-loam soils. Four years of litterfall measurements showed four major patterns. First, independent of herbivory, needle litterfall was 20\% lower under trees on high-stress cinder soils than on sandy-loam soils. Second, in agreement with the negative impact of scales on tree growth (that is, a 30\% decline in stem growth), trees with scale infestations had 25\% lower litterfall rates than trees resistant to scale; however, 15 years of scale-insect removal did not significantly increase needle litterfall. This implies possible intrinsic differences in litter production between scale-resistant and scale-susceptible trees. Third, in contrast with significant negative effects of moth herbivory on tree growth (that is, a 27\% decline in stem growth), moth herbivory had no effect on needle litterfall. This, along with increased stem density in moth-susceptible trees, may be evidence of compensatory production. Fourth, there were strong year by soil type and year by scale herbivory interactions, such that in some years the effect on litterfall can be obscured or reversed by some other factor. In summary, soil stress has a strong and predictable effect on needle litterfall, whereas the relationship between insect herbivory and needle litterfall is weaker and depends on the individual herbivore. These effects, however, are mediated by other environmental factors that have considerable annual variation.

AB  - Feedback between plants and the soil is frequently invoked on the basis of evidence of mutual effects. Feedback can operate through pathways involving soil physical properties, chemical and biogeochemical properties and processes, and biological properties, including the community composition of the microbiota and soil fauna. For each pathway, we review the mechanistic basis and assess the evidence that feedback occurs. We suggest that several properties of feedback systems (for example, their complexity, specificity, and strength relative to other ecological factors, as well as the temporal and spatial scales over which they operate) be considered. We find that the evidence of feedback is strongest for plants growing in extreme environments and for plant-mutualist or plant-enemy interactions. We conclude with recommendations for a more critical appraisal of feedback and for new directions of research.

AB  - Attempts to understand and conserve biodiversity are hampered by a lack of information about many taxonomic groups, particularly those groups that are the most species rich. Although fungi are ubiquitous and play an important role in decomposition, nutrient cycling and nutrient uptake, little is known about fungal diversity, as fungi are usually cryptic and ephemeral. Based on a meta-analysis of macrofungal diversity studies, we show that tree diversity is a promising surrogate for macrofungal diversity at large spatial scales. We present evidence that trees species richness can be used to predict macrofungal species richness and that on the global scale, the distribution of individual tree and macrofungal species notably differs. Additionally our findings provide support for the use of ``ratio estimates{''} to estimate fungal species richness. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The variability of spatial distribution of different mycelia types were analysed by point tests in soils on transsects at two plots in bilberry spruce forest and spruce forest without herbaceous stand (Zvenigorod Biological Station MSU, Moscow region). The mosaic character of the mycelial colonisation in soil was shown. General biomass and biomasses of each group of the mycelia depended on tree location such as on lower story character. Mycelia horizontal spatial distribution in soil and litter according colonial profile and the main patterns of its influence upon soil microbiota were revealed by means of point soil samples on radial transsects in the areas of 14 symbiotrophic and saprotrophic basidiomycetes mapped colonies. Significant differences in values of fungal and bacterial biomass at different points of profile transsects were detected. The pattern of impact on myco- and microbiota structure observed in the zone of active growth and basidiomata formation was typical for each species.

AB  - Molecular methods based on soil DNA extracts are increasingly being used to study the fungal diversity of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal communities in soil. Contrary to EM root tip identification, the use of molecular methods enables identification of extramatrical mycelia in soil. To compare fungal diversity as determined by root tip identification and mycelial identification, six soil samples were analysed. Root tips were extracted from the six samples and after amplification, the basidiomycete diversity on the root tips was analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The soil from the six samples was sieved, total soil DNA was extracted and after amplification, the basidiomycete diversity in the soil fractions was analysed by DGGE. Fourteen different bands were excised from the DGGE gel and sequenced; fungal taxon names could be assigned to eight bands. Out of a total of 14 fungal taxa detected in soil, 11 fungal taxa were found on root tips, of which seven were EM fungal taxa. To examine whether the sieving treatment would affect EM species diversity, two different sieve mesh sizes were used and in addition, the organic soil fraction was analysed separately. DGGE analysis showed no differences in banding pattern for the different soil fractions. The organic fraction gave the highest DGGE band intensities. This work demonstrates that there is a high correspondence between basidiomycete diversity detected by molecular analysis of root tips and soil samples, irrespective of the soil fraction being analysed.

AB  - This study compares the potential of natural charcoal from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and activated carbon to improve germination under the hypothesis that natural charcoal adsorbs phytotoxins produced by dwarf-shrubs, but due to it's chemical properties to a lesser extent than activated carbon. Activated carbon has been used in many bioassays as an adsorbate to clean aqueous solutions. We used aqueous extracts from young leaves of Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull and Vaccinium myrtillus (L.) as phytotoxin sources in two different concentrations (10 and 14 gr. of dried leaves in 100 ml distilled water). Germination of pine seeds was prevented by the higher concentration of both species, while the lower ones did not show significantly reduced germination. Both ericaceous species showed a very similar potential to prevent germination of Scots pine seeds. Supplemented carbon (activated carbon, powdered or granulated pine charcoal) restored germination in strong extracts. Adding activated carbon resulted in germination of almost 100\%. With pine charcoals added, lower germination percentages were observed. The charcoal powder was more effective (60\% for C. vulgaris; 28\% for V. myrtillus) than the charcoal granulate (30\% and 16\%, respectively) in restoring germination. Chemical and surface analysis of the three carbon supplements revealed that activated carbon had by far the biggest active surface area (641 m(2) g(-1)), and thus many more cavities to bind phytotoxins than natural charcoal (total surface area of 142 m(2) g(-1)). We conclude, that charcoal produced by forest fires can have a positive effect on seed germination, but to a much lesser extent than activated carbon. Previous studies, which used activated carbon as an equivalent for charcoal, overestimated the effect of charcoal on germination.

AB  - A drastic decrease in the presence and productivity of many fungal species, especially symbionts, has been recorded in various parts of Europe. Many of the most famous edible species, such as the group of Boletus edulis s.l., are in this category. The present study proposes to clarify the ecological requirements of these species (B. edulis s.l.), in order to provide guidelines for environmental management aimed at conserving the ideal habitat of this culinary delicacy. The presence of B. edulis in two age classes (30 and 60 years) of fir woods and data on the effects of various management treatments (thinning and litter removal) on the fruiting process are reported. B. edulis is replaced by Boletus badius in older stands. Medium thinning seems to have a positive effect whereas removal of the litter layer has a negative effect on the fruiting process of B. edulis. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We evaluated the influence of the brown rot fungus Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca on P solubility in the humus layer of a podzolic forest soil. This fungus is known to exude large amounts of oxalic acid that may stimulate weathering of minerals and increase dissolution of humus, which in turn may increase P availability in the soil surrounding the fungus. Humus was inoculated using small wooden pieces colonised by the fungus. The presence of the fungus resulted in elevated concentration of PO4- in the humus solution. In a second experiment birch 4 seedlings grown in the same humus were able to utilise the PO4- mobilised by the fungus to increase their internal P content. The factor 4 determining this increased P uptake and the increased available P might be oxalate produced by fungus. The acid may directly dissolve P or change organic forms of P making it more susceptible to reaction with phosphatases. This fungal effect on P solubility diminished when N was added to the soil in the form of a slow release N fertilizer (methyl urea), or when a soil with a higher soil N concentration was used. We found a strong correlation between NH4+ concentration and total organic carbon in the soil solution at high NH4+ concentrations, suggesting the dissolution of humus as a result of the high NH4+ content in the solution. This study demonstrates that the wood-decaying fungus H. aurantiaca influences nutrient turnover in forest soil, and thereby nutrient uptake by forest trees. An intensified harvest of forest products such as whole tree harvesting may decrease the active biomass of the wood decomposers and may thereby change the availability of P and the leaching of N.

AB  - Interrelations of fungal mycelium with other soil biota are of paramount importance in forestry and soil ecology. Here we present the results of statistical analysis of a comprehensive data set collected in the first (and the only) British fungus sanctuary over a period of four months. The variables studied included a number of soil properties, bacteria, protozoan flagellates, ciliates and amoebae, microbial and plant feeding nematodes, various microarthropods, and two fungal biomarkers - Lylonialin and ergosterol. One way ANOVA showed that the dynamics of the microbiota studied was influenced by seasonal changes. Superimposed on these changes, however, was variability due to biological interactions and habitat characteristics. Two fun al biomarkers, ergosterol and glomalin, were differently influenced by other biota and abiotic variables. The results indicate that the dynamics of soil fungi is influenced not only by soil microarthropods, but also by those found in forest litter. The overall outcome, therefore, is likely to be very complex and will depend upon specific conditions of any particular ecosystem.

AB  - Hyphae and vesicles of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were found within the decomposing leaves of Myrica parvifolia, M. pubescens and Paepalanthus sp. at three montane sites in Colombia. Hyphae, vesicles, and arbuscule-like structures were also found within scale-like leaves of the rhizomes of Paepalanthus sp. The litter found in the vicinity of the roots was divided into three decomposition layers. The highest AMF colonization occurred in the most decomposed leaves, which were in close association with roots. In contrast, there were no differences in AMF colonization of roots present in the different decomposition layers. Colonization of decomposing leaves by AMF did not differ between the two closely related species M. parvifolia and M. pubescens, nor between two sites (Guatavita and Zipacon, Colombia) differing in soil fertility. Occurrence of vesicles in decomposing leaves was correlated with abundant AMF extraradical hyphae among the leaves. We propose that AMF enter decomposing leaves mechanically through vascular tissue. As a consequence, AMF are well positioned to obtain and efficiently recycle mineral nutrients released by decomposer microorganisms before their loss by leaching or immobilization in soil.

AB  - Here, we investigated the spatial and temporal abundance of mycelial mats in a tropical rain forest to determine their effects on the concentration of mineral nutrients in soils and fine roots. Mats were marked and followed over three seasons. Fine-root mass and the concentration of mineral nutrients in both soils and roots were determined for mat-associated soils and for a control group. Mats were more abundant in the dry season than in the wet season. The concentration of mineral nutrients in soils and fine roots increased from the rainy season to the end of the dry season. Mats appeared to affect the concentration of phosphorus, potassium and calcium, and the carbon : nitrogen and nitrogen : phosphorus ratios in soils and roots during all seasons. Mats appeared to compete with plants for certain minerals. This could be part of `bottom up' effects that may influence underground herbivory, as well as the above-ground concentrations of mineral nutrients in plants. Mats are relevant to understanding soil biodiversity and the potential feedback paths between the soil and above-ground subsystems. (C) New Phytologist (2004).

AB  - Chronic N additions to forest ecosystems can enhance soil N availability, potentially leading to reduced C allocation to root systems. This in turn could decrease soil CO2 efflux. We measured soil respiration during the first, fifth, sixth and eighth years of simulated atmospheric NO3- deposition (3 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) to four sugar maple-dominated northern hardwood forests in Michigan to assess these possibilities. During the first year, soil respiration rates were slightly, but not significantly, higher in the NO3--amended plots. In all subsequent measurement years, soil respiration rates from NO3--amended soils were significantly depressed. Soil temperature and soil matric potential were measured concurrently with soil respiration and used to develop regression relationships for predicting soil respiration rates. Estimates of growing season and annual soil CO2 efflux made using these relationships indicate that these C fluxes were depressed by 15\% in the eighth year of chronic NO3- additions. The decrease in soil respiration was not due to reduced C allocation to roots, as root respiration rates, root biomass, and root turnover were not significantly affected by N additions. Aboveground litter also was unchanged by the 8 years of treatment. Of the remaining potential causes for the decline in soil CO2 efflux, reduced microbial respiration appears to be the most likely possibility. Documented reductions in microbial biomass and the activities of extracellular enzymes used for litter degradation on the NO3--amended plots are consistent with this explanation.

AB  - We investigated the effect of an optimal nutrition strategy designed to maximize loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) growth on the rank abundance structure and diversity of associated basidiomycete communities. We conducted both small- and large-scale below-ground surveys 10 years after the initiation of optimal nutrition, and used TRFLP of selectively PCR-amplified nrDNA ITS to determine the distribution and abundance of macrofungal basidiomycete species in c. 200 soil samples collected from optimally fertilized and unfertilized treatments at the SETRES loblolly pine experimental site, North Carolina, USA. Our results indicated an increased relative abundance of Tylopilus and Thelephora spp. on optimally fertilized stands. Our results also suggested improved mycelial growth of several species, possibly caused by increased connectivity in the forest floor as a result of increased plant growth. In addition, our results suggest a trend towards reduced basidiomycete diversity, and that large-scale application of optimal nutrition may need to be sensitive to increased nitrate availability.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi occur abundantly in the mineral horizons of forest soils, but their interactions with mineral substrates are largely unknown. We have examined the proliferation of ectomycorrhizal roots and mycelium colonising different mineral substrates. By exposing the shoots of Pinus sylvestris seedlings to air containing (CO2)-C-14, the carbon allocation patterns in intact ectomycorrhizal associations could be monitored using electronic auto radiography. In plants colonised by either Hebeloma crustuliniforme or Piloderma fallax, a larger fraction of the photosynthetically derived carbon was allocated to a mineral soil substrate compared with a Sphagnum peat. In mycorrhizal seedlings colonised by H. crustuliniforme, carbon allocation was significantly greater to roots and mycelia colonising patches of pure potassium feldspar than to those in patches of quartz. These results suggest that ectomycorrhizal mycelia may respond to the presence of different mineral substrates by regulating their growth and activity.

AB  - Knowledge of the habitat and host associations of Craterellus tubaeformis (winter chanterelle) is the key to understanding the ecological characteristics needed for its conservation. In this study, a survey of forest types in northwestern Oregon for mycorrhizal associates is performed and the hypotheses that stand age and the volume of well-decayed, coarse, woody debris (CWD) are significant to the standing crop biomass and the probability of C. tubaeformis occurrence are tested. Host, associations were identified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) typing. Habitat associations were tested by measurements on 64 plots in the Coast and Cascade Ranges of northwestern Oregon. Data analysis found that stand age and well-decayed, coarse, woody debris were related significantly to the probability of C. tubaeformis occurrence buts not to standing crop biomass. Results indicated the volume of well-decayed CWD is particularly important to the probability of C. tubaeformis occurrence in stands less than 100 yr of age. Well-decayed CWD was the substratum for 88\% of C. tubaeformis sporocarps across all stands, despite the fact that ground area coverage of CWD ranged only from 3 to 26\%. Slope, elevation and aspect were not related to the probability of C. tubaeformis occurrence or standing crop biomass. The occurrence of C. tubaeformis in northwestern Oregon is highly correlated to the presence of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and their mycorrhizal association was confirmed. Craterellus tubaeformis also can form mycorrhizae with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) but is encountered only rarely in stands without a hemlock component. In northwestern Oregon, the presence of Hydnum spp. in a stand is a good indicator of the presence of C. tubaeformis. Differences in genetic sequences between C. tubaeformis populations in western North America, eastern North America and Europe suggest the likelihood of several distinct species.

AB  - Lepiotaceous fungi form relatively fragile basidiocarps with white, rarely coloured, spores. Most are saprotrophic forest-floor dwellers that grow in the lower litter layers of the soil, and probably decompose lignin and cellulose. They occur worldwide, with many representatives in tropical and temperate regions, and a few species in arctic-alpine areas and in deserts. Most taxa are agaricoid, though a relatively small number of secotioid variants exist. Because of their relative rarity, the clustering together of many species in limited habitats, and the differences in species composition along latitudinal transects, lepiotaceous fungi may be vulnerable to changes in the environment, both on a local (habitat destruction) and on a global scale (climate change). Sister taxa occur in different parts of the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere, indicating that vicariance events might have played a role in speciation. A few species have a very extended distribution, and those species occur either in man-made habitats or else in cooler habitats. Many ecological features of the lepiotaceous fungi are unknown, including the survival rates and colonization success of spores, nutrient and temperature requirements, longevity and size of genets. Conservation of existing diversity calls for policies underpinned by new ecological research, more taxonomical studies, and more recording projects.

AB  - The filamentous fungi have dynamic and variable hyphal structures within which cytoplasm can be moved, synthesized, and degraded, in response to changes in environmental conditions, resource availability, and resource distribution. Their study has gone through several phases. In the first phase, direct observation was emphasized without undue concern for interior structures or in the presence of cytoplasm. By the mid-1970s, single biochemical proxies (ergosterol, marker fatty acids, chitin derivatives, etc.) were being used increasingly. The use of these surrogate single measurements continues, in spite of their inability to provide information on the physical structure of the filamentous fungi. Molecular approaches also are being used, primarily through the use of bulk nucleic acid extraction and cloning. Because the sources of the nucleic acids used in such studies usually are not known, taxonomic and phylogenetic information derived by this approach cannot be linked to specific fungal structures. Recently, a greater emphasis has been place on assessing physical aspects of indeterminate fungal growth, involving the assessment of cytoplasm-filled and evacuated (empty) hyphae. Both of these parameters are important for describing filamentous fungal growth and function. The use of phase contrast microscopy and varied general stains, as well as fluorogenic substrates with observation by epifluorescence microscopy, has made it possible to provide estimates of cytoplasm-filled hyphal lengths. Using this approach, it has been possible to evaluate the responses of the indeterminate fungal community to changes in environmental conditions, including soil management. it is now possible to obtain molecular information from individual bacteria and fungal structures (hyphae, spores, fruiting bodies) recovered from environments, making it possible to link individual fungal structures with their taxonomic and phylogenetic information. In addition, this information can be considered in the context of the indeterminate filamentous fungal lifestyle, involving the dynamics of resource allocation to hyphal structural development and synthesis of cytoplasm. Use of this approach should make it possible to gain a greater appreciation of the indeterminate filamentous fungal lifestyle, particularly in the context of microbial ecology.

AB  - Until recently, the common view of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle had been driven by two core assumptions-plants use only inorganic N and they compete poorly against soil microbes for N. Thus, plants were thought to use N that microbes ``left over,{''} allowing the N cycle to be divided cleanly into two pieces-the microbial decomposition side and the plant uptake and use side. These were linked by the process of net mineralization. Over the last decade, research has changed these views. N cycling is now seen as being driven by the depolymerization of N-containing polymers by microbial (including mycorrhizal) extracellular enzymes. This releases organic N-containing monomers that may be used by either plants or microbes. However, a complete new conceptual model of the soil N cycle needs to incorporate recent research on plant-microbe competition and microsite processes to explain the dynamics of N across the wide range of N availability found in terrestrial ecosystems. We discuss the evolution of thinking about the soil N cycle, propose a new integrated conceptual model that explains how N cycling changes as ecosystem N availability changes, and discuss methodological issues raised by the changing paradigm of terrestrial N cycling.

AB  - Due to their high abundance and ubiquitous existence, microbes are considered to be efficient colonisers of newly established habitats. To shed light on the dispersal mechanisms of soil microbes, a controlled microcosm experiment was established. In these microcosms, the dispersal of microbes from a source humus patch to originally sterile humus patches (embedded in a mineral soil matrix) was followed for 16 months, applying 16S and 18S ribosomal DNA-based PCR-DGGE molecular methods. Specifically, the role of enchytraeid worms and habitat (humus) corridors as possible facilitators of microbe dispersal was studied. The results showed that enchytraeid worms function efficiently as vectors for horizontal dispersal of saprophytic fungi in soil. Some of the fungi also proved to disperse through the corridors by vegetative growth, although this dispersal was inefficient as compared to dispersal with the enchytraeids. Virtually no saprophytic fungi were able to disperse through the mineral soil matrix in the absence of both enchytraeid worms and corridors. Unlike soil fungi, the dispersal of soil bacteria was not affected by any of the studied factors. The results of the present experiment provide direct evidence of the crucial role of soil fauna in aiding the horizontal dispersal of soil fungi. The role of enchytraeids as a functionally important species in boreal forest soils is further emphasized, since bringing microbes into contact with new resources is likely to enhance the rate of decomposition in soils.

AB  - Soluble organic N and microbial N pools in terrestrial ecosystems have been less studied than those of inorganic N. Therefore, cross-system variation in their pool sizes and seasonal dynamics, both absolute and relative to inorganic N pools, needs to be quantified so that their ecological importance in different ecosystems can be evaluated. We measured extractable soil organic N (ESON), microbial biomass N (MBN), and the net production rates of ESON in red oak-dominated remnant forests, along an urban-rural gradient in the New York City metropolitan area. We were interested in (1) determining the seasonal dynamics of ESON and MBN, and (2) examining whether the contrasts in land use (urban, suburban, rural) surrounding these forest remnants were associated with different amounts of ESON and MBN. This field-based study was conducted continuously for 16 months. Yearly average ESON concentrations ranged from 60 to 140 mg kg(-1) soil organic matter (SOM), 3-4 times those of inorganic N, and average MBN ranged from 600 to 1100 mg kg(-1) SOM. There was a considerable MBN increase in spring in all plots across the gradient. The average increase expressed on an areal basis (to a depth of 7.5 cm) ranged from 1.75 to 4.19 a N m(-2). The N incorporated into the microbial biomass in spring was gradually released later in the growing season (the mean MBN decrease ranged from 1.11 to 3.82 g N m(-2)). The spring MBN increase could be an important retention mechanism for conserving soil inorganic N when plant N uptake may be low. The amplitude in the seasonal dynamics of ESON was far less than that of inorganic N, as was that of net ESON production rates when compared to net N mineralization. These suggest a closer coupling of plant N uptake with inorganic N, much more than with ESON. Both ESON and MBN were significantly higher in rural soils than in urban soils, and both concentrations were positively correlated with SOM content. The variation in ESON, MBN, or SOM associated with this urbanization gradient suggests that the form of N exported, the plant N budget and soil N retention mechanisms may be differentially affected by urban, suburban and rural land uses.

AB  - In the given study the author carried out investigations on ecology of Salix acutifolia and its role in soil-forming process and creating plant communities in areas of extreme edaphic conditions. Soil-forming influence of this willow is connected with chemical composition (Na, K, Ca, Mg, P, Fe, Al., Zn, Cu, Li, Ni, Cd, Ph) of its litter (leaf, bark, fine twigs), which enriches sand after decomposition. Investigations proved that herbaceous plants and tree seedlings in open areas could develop only under the canopy of willow. Exchangeable cations are also directly concentrated within the range of canopy. This property of willow causes that it can develop in sandy areas. It points at the possibility to apply this species in land reclamation in anthropogenically transformed areas as the alternative for cost-consuming ways of alien species introducing into the landscape.

AB  - The effect of the saprotrophic ascomycete Chalara longipes on the decomposition of humic acids was determined in a cultivation experiment. The fungus was incubated in liquid cultures in a full-strength (F system) and an organic nitrogen-free medium (F-N system), both amended with pure humic acids isolated from spruce forest litter. Fungal biomass production was highest in the F system with humic acids and lowest in the F-N system, the effect of organic nitrogen and humic acids being significant (p < 0.05). The presence of organic nitrogen seems to be essential for growth. The fungus utilized humic acids; molar mass distribution in media obtained by gel-permeation chromatography showed decrease in the humic acids fraction. Decolorization of the media reached 75 and 64 \% in the F and F-N systems, respectively. The molar mass of humic acids probably also decreased as estimated from the increase in the absorbance A(465)/A(665) (A(4)/A(6)) ratio. It is assumed that the utilization of humic acids may be mediated by the production of organic acids (as their components) and production of some oxidative enzymes.

AB  - Ectomycorrhiza of Picea abies and Betula sp. was the subject of the research. The ectomycorrhizal morphology and spatial distribution were explored at 10 sample plots. The special and spatial analyses of macromycetes (especially symbiotrophic ones) were carried out. In the sporocarp survey 80 macromycete species belonging to 5 trophic groups were observed. Symbiotrophic group dominated. Most abundant in number of species were genera Russula, Lactarius, Cortinarius and Amanita. Sporocarp inventory revealed that the highest amounts of sporocarps belong to such species as Lactarius camphoratus, L. mitissimus and Collybia butyracea. According to the data of sporocarp inventories Lactarius camphoratus, L. mitissimus and L. necator turned out to be the dominant species. During the morphological research 4 types of ectomycorrhiza were observed. The most complex forms located in the upper layers of soil. The degree of mycorrhization and dry weight of mycorrhizal root tips for spruce was significantly higher than the same indices for birch. The decrement of mycorrhization from the litter to the deeper layers of soil was detected in all observations.

AB  - Soil animals (macro and microarthropods, annelids, nematodes) were sampled along an altitudinal gradient and over 2 years in holm oak (Quercus rotundifolia) forests of the Moroccan Atlas. We studied the influence of elevation and year on the vertical distribution of soil fauna. Whatever the elevation (1500, 1700 and 1900 m), the humus form was a Dysmull, with a thick litter horizon and a fine crumb A horizon. Thirty-six categories of fauna were found and classified at the group level. The influence of horizon, altitude and year was analysed by analyses of variance (ANOVA, on seven broad zoological groups and on total fauna) and correspondence analysis (on 36 zoological groups). There was a decrease in the population size of most zoological groups from organic (OL, OF) to mineral horizons (A, S), but OL and OF horizons varied as the most populated horizon according to years and animal groups. More animals and more animal groups were present at higher elevation, following an increase in food and habitat availability. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB  - Fine root distribution and turnover were investigated in ca. 40-year-old pure Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) stands in Germany, growing on four sites that differed in soil acidity (Ebergotzen < Barbis < Fichtelgebirge = Harz). The density of fine root biomass and necromass in different soil horizons differed among the sites. At one of the most acidic sites (Harz), fine root density in the humus layer was more than twice that at the least acidic site (Ebergotzen). At the two most acidic sites, Fichtelgebirge and Harz, the ratio of biomass to necromass was significantly lower than at Ebergotzen and Barbis, particularly in the subsoil layer. In each stand, clear vertical gradients in fine root length density and root tip density were observed. Most of the roots and the root tips were in the humus layer and in the first mineral soil horizon (0-10 cm). There was a significantly different decrease in specific root length (cm g(DM)(-1)) and specific root tip density (root tips g(DM)(-1)) in the more acidified stands Fichtelgebirge and Harz compared with Ebergotzen and Barbis. Fine root production estimated by ingrowth cores and a net method was approximately twice as high in the more acidic stands Fichtelgebirge and Harz compared with Ebergotzen and Barbis. Rates of living fine root biomass turnover were higher at the Fichtelgebirge and Harz sites than at the Ebergotzen site. Rates of necromass turnover were similar at all sites. The results suggest that the accumulation of necromass was not due to a slower disappearance at the more acid sites, but to earlier root death. Roots contributed 46\% to root + needle litter and 32\% to root + total aboveground litter at the Harz site in 1997.

AB  - The effects of CO2 elevation on the dynamics of fine root (FR) mass and ectomycorrhizal (EM) mass and colonization were studied in situ in a Florida scrub oak system over four years of postfire regeneration. Soil cores were taken at five dates and sorted to assess the standing crop of ectomycorrhizal and fine roots. We used ingrowth bags to estimate the effects of elevated CO2 on production of EM roots and fine roots. Elevated CO2 tended to increase EM colonization frequency but did not affect EM mass nor FR mass in soil cores (standing mass). However, elevated CO2 strongly increased EM mass and FR mass in ingrowth bags (production), but it did not affect the EM colonization frequency therein. An increase in belowground production with unchanged biomass indicates that elevated CO2 may stimulate root turnover. The CO2-stimulated increase of belowground production was initially larger than that of aboveground production. The oaks may allocate a larger portion of resources to root/mycorrhizal production in this system in elevated rather than ambient CO2.

AB  - Humus forms are the seat of most biological transformations taking place in terrestrial ecosystems, being at the interface between plants, animals and microbes. The diversity of terrestrial humus forms (mor, moder and mull) can be attributed to the existence of different patterns (strategies) for the capture and use of resources by ecosystems, in ascending order of biodiversity and bioavailability. Arguments are found in the parallel development of humus forms and terrestrial ecosystems, in exclusion mechanisms between organisms living in different humus forms, and in palaeontological studies. The diversification of terrestrial life forms in the course of Earth history, concomitant with an improvement in resource availability due to the development of sedimentary layers at the surface of continents, may explain the successive appearance of more active humus forms enabling the co-existence of an increasing number of organisms. Contradictory reports about the relationships between biodiversity and stability of ecosystems can be explained by the existence of different belowground pathways making ecosystems more stable.

AB  - The fine root systems of three tropical montane forests differing in age and history were investigated in the Cordillera Talamanca, Costa Rica. We analyzed abundance, vertical distribution, and morphology of fine roots in an early successional forest (10-15 years old, FSF), a mid-successional forest (40 years old, MSF), and a nearby undisturbed old-growth forest (OGF), and related the root data to soil morphological and chemical parameters. The OGF stand contained a 19 cm deep organic layer on the forest floor (i.e., 530 mol C/m(2)) which was two and five times thicker than that of the MSF (10 cm) and ESF stands (4 cm), respectively. There was a corresponding decrease in fine root biomass in this horizon from 1128 g dry matter/m(2) in the old-growth forest to 337 (MSF) and 31 g/m(2) (ESF) in the secondary forests, although the stands had similar leaf areas. The organic layer was a preferred substrate for fine root growth in the old-growth forest as indicated by more than four times higher fine root densities (root mass per soil volume) than in the mineral topsoil (0-10 cm); in the two secondary forests, root densities in the organic layer were equal to or lower than in the mineral soil. Specific fine root surface areas and specific root tip abundance (tips per unit root dry mass) were significantly greater in the roots of the ESF than the MSF and OGF stands. Most roots of the ESF trees (8 abundant species) were infected by VA mycorrhizal fungi; ectomycorrhizal species (Quercus copeyensis and Q. costaricensis) were dominant in the MSF and OGF stands. Replacement of tropical montane oak forest by secondary forest in Costa Rica has resulted in (1) a large reduction of tree fine root biomass; (2) a substantial decrease in depth of the organic layer (and thus in preferred rooting space); and (3) a great loss of soil carbon and nutrients. Whether old-growth Quercus forests maintain a very high fine root biomass because their ectomycorrhizal rootlets are less effective in nutrient absorption than those of VA mycorrhizal secondary forests, or if their nutrient demand is much higher than that of secondary forests (despite a similar leaf area and leaf mass production), remains unclear.

AB  - The effect of timber harvesting on the biomass, nutrient standing crop, and decomposition of fine roots (<2 mm) was studied in a high elevation, Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) - subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) forest. Root dynamics were compared in openings of different sizes. The sequential core method was used to collect fine root samples over 4 years. Differences in fine root biomass between opening sizes were most significant for the active fine root portion and were most pronounced in the fall compared with the spring. Active fine root biomass was significantly lower in the 10-ha clearcuts (164 kg/ha) compared with control plots (275 kg/ha). Furthermore, active fine root biomass was often lower in the 1.0-ha opening than in the 0.1-ha and control plots. A similar trend was established for inactive fine root biomass, although this was not consistent over sampling years. Nutrient concentrations of K, but no other elements, were higher in control plots. Nutrient standing crops, however, followed trends observed in fine root biomass. In the 10-ha clearcuts, the largest changes in fine root biomass occurred at the edge of the opening. The findings suggest that small (<10 ha) cutblocks may maintain greater fine root longevity.

AB  - The effect of the endogeic earthworm, Aporrectodea trapezoides on the growth of Douglas-fir seedlings grown in three different soils was studied. Soils from pure and mixed stands of Douglas-fir and paper birch were used. Seedlings were grown in earthworm-worked and control soils for 10 months in the laboratory. At 5 and 10 months, differences in plant growth, available N and P, mycorrhizal colonization, microbial functional diversity and microbial activity were assessed. Douglas-fir seedling root biomass was greater in worm-worked compared to control soils. Height of seedlings varied significantly during the 5-8 months period of growth with taller seedlings in worm-worked soils. Foliar calcium levels of seedlings were higher at 10 months in worm-worked soils compared to the control. Effects of A. trapezoides on pH were unclear due to a worm x soil type interaction. Worm-worked mineral soil generally had higher organic matter levels compared to control soils but few differences were apparent in the forest floor layer. Average available NO3- and -NH4+ levels were higher in worm-worked forest floor at 10 months yet there were no differences in the mineral soil at this time. The effect of A. trapezoides on mycorrhizal colonization of Douglas-fir seedling roots differed with the different soil types whereby seedlings grown in pure and mixed birch soils were less colonized compared to the control. Average total bacterial activity, substrate richness and diversity were consistently higher in worm-worked forest floor and mineral soil compared to the control treatment. The trend in microbial respiration in worm-worked forest floor and mineral soil was not clear while effects on microbial biomass in the mineral soil were confounded by a worm x soil type interaction. The metabolic quotient was generally lower in worm-worked soils compared to control soils. Douglas-fir seedlings grown in pure worm-worked fir soils were often affected differently or more dramatically compared to seedlings grown in pure birch or mixed soils. The results of the experiment indicate that A. trapezoides has the potential to enhance Douglas-fir seedling growth. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil fungi are integral to decomposition in forests and other habitats, yet identifying probable functional roles of different taxa is problematic. Here, we compared carbohydrate assimilation patterns derived from stable isotope analyses on cultures with patterns of metabolic activity measured on Biolog(R) SF-P plates for 12 taxa of soil- and litter-inhabiting saprotrophic fungi isolated from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) ecosystems. To determine the relative assimilation of carbon from malt extract versus sucrose by C-13 stable isotope analyses, we cultured fungi with malt extract (consisting primarily of glucose and maltose) plus either C-3(-) or C-4-derived sucrose as carbon sources. Rhodotorula graminis and F. oxysporum assimilated the highest proportion of sucrose, a Mortierella isolate and an unidentified sterile isolate (FPC 341) assimilated the lowest proportion of sucrose, and remaining cultures assimilated similar and intermediate proportions of sucrose. On Biolog plates, low metabolic activity of Mortierella and FPC 341 on sucrose and R. graminis and F. oxysporum on maltose were qualitatively consistent with isotopic results. Assimilation of sucrose calculated isotopically was correlated with the ratio of sucrose: maltose activity calculated from Biolog assays (r(2) = 0.45, P = 0.0145, n = 12). Metabolic activity on Biolog plates for six other common soil carbohydrates were also determined: glucose, fructose, galactose, cellobiose, lactose, and glycogen. Metabolic activity was greatest overall on maltose and glucose and lowest on fructose. Two of the isolates (Aspergillus flavus and F. oxysporum) had higher metabolic activity on the glucose-containing disaccharide cellobiose than on glucose, strongly suggesting preferential uptake of cellobiose compared to glucose and suggesting the potential ability to use cellulose. The high metabolic activity of these cultures on galactose, a primary constituent of hemicellulose, also suggested cellulolytic capabilities. Our results indicated that stable isotope studies and Biolog assays may provide complementary information to characterize metabolic potential of fungi in forest litter and soil.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of elevated N in dead organic matter on the growth of fungi and to establish the consequences for the development of microbivores. Therefore, three fungal species were cultured on Scots pine litter differing in N content. The growth of the soil fungal species Trichoderma koningii, Penicillium glabrum and Cladosporium cladosporioides was directly influenced by the N content (ranging from 1.25 to 2.19\% N) of the substrate. For all three fungal species maximum growth was highest at intermediate N content (1.55\%) of the substrate. The fungivorous collembolan Orchesella cincta reached highest asymptotic body mass when fed with C. cladosporioides, grown on litter medium with intermediate N content (1.55\%). The growth of O. cincta was lower when fed with C. cladosporioides from litter medium with the highest N content (2.19\%). Similar results were obtained in mesocosm experiments in which pine litter with three levels of N (I. I I 1.78 2.03\% N) was used as substrate for the fungi. On litter with the highest N content (2.03\%) hyphal length and asymptotic body mass of O. cincta were reduced. The results show that the N content of the substrate determines the growth of both fungi and fungivores, and suggest that elevated levels of N in soil track through the fungal part of the soil food web.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse whether the functional diversity of the fungal community follows the environmental gradients as much as vascular plants. After determination of the Ellenberg's indicator values on the basis of 602 cormophyte species occurring in 110 permanent plots across Central Europe, the relation between soil fungi and the abiotic factors as defined by Ellenberg's indicators has been evaluated. The palynological assessment proves that not the fungal occurrence, but the concentration of fungal remains is the most appropriate tool to unravel causal links between the belowground microflora and the soil abiotic factors. The analyses show a striking dichotomy within the fungal community. First, the logarithms of fungal diversity and hyphal density show close but opposite relationships with light, moisture, soil reaction and nitrogen availability. Second, fungal functional groups show parallel, decreasing trends for soil reaction and nitrogen availability. Aside from the mycorrhizal network as a whole (ericoid, EM and AM), we demonstrate that the degree of ecological information supplied by the different trophic levels (litter-related fungi, fimicolous fungi, wood-related fungi and strictly ericoid mycorrhizal fungi) is much greater than expected from previous studies.

AB  - The analysis of micro- and mycobiota in radial transsects of the 16 mapped Lepista nuda fairy rings showed the significant differences in their distribution in the sites of mycelial active growth and in the center. In the central parts of colonies numerous destroyed mycelial fragments of L. nuda were found by direct microscope analysis; the amounts of actinomycetes were increased, but micromycetes decreased. It was shown in that the significance of increasing of actinomycetes,populations producing mycolytic enzymes and antifungal antibiotics is one of the mechanisms causing the reorganization of mycobiota in the central parts of the L. nuda fairy rings.

AB  - The composition of saprotrophic fungal communities on sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) leaf litters from a woodland at Cefnpennar in South Wales, UK, were analysed in late winter and early spring every three years between 1988 and 2000. Decreases in predicted (assessed by presence of lichen indicator species) and measured concentrations of gaseous SO2 emitted from a nearby phurnacite briquetting plant were recorded at the woodland during this period, together with reductions in concentrations Of SO42--S leached from leaf litters. Changes to the saprotrophic fungal communities on the litters were also observed between 1988 and 2000. Generalised linear models and rank correlation analyses indicated that Aureobasidium pullulans, Fusarium avenaceum, F lateritium, Verticillium lecanii and Torula herbarum became more abundant on oak and sycamore litters. By contrast, Acremonium persicinum, Cylindrocarpon orthosporum, Phoma macrostoma and Trichoderma spp. became less abundant on both litter types. These changes to the composition of saprotrophic fungal communities broadly corroborate those derived from open-air SO2 fumigation experiments. They infer that fungal community composition is influenced by SO2 in the natural environment and that recovery of communities takes place following chronic exposure to the gas.

AB  - Sites dominated by Kalmia angustifolia L. are often associated with slow decomposition of organic matter, decreased nitrogen (N) mineralization rates, and low black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) productivity. The objective of this study was to separate the effects of belowground competition by Kalmia from the effects of water-soluble soil phenols on black spruce seedlings growing under different levels of Kalmia cover. A factorial greenhouse bioassay was established in which black spruce seedlings were grown for 6 months in intact blocks of soil with three different levels of Kalmia cover. The soil was treated with charcoal to reduce the amounts of water-soluble phenols, and (or) tubes were inserted to exclude Kalmia roots. At low Kalmia cover, reducing the level of belowground competition increased seedling biomass by 134\%. However, reducing belowground competition did not increase seedling biomass at the two higher levels of Kalmia cover. It is possible that seedling biomass remained low because of an increased immobilization of N in the organic layer. Furthermore, the proportion of ectomycorrhiza morphotypes differed among seedlings growing under different levels of Kalmia cover. The effect of water-soluble phenols on seedling growth remains uncertain, since we observed a confounding effect of the charcoal treatment on soil microbial biomass and seedling response.

AB  - Stipitate hydnoid fungi (specifically members of the genera Bankera, Hydnellum, Phellodon, Sarcodon) have become the focus of increasing conservation concern, particularly following the detection of widespread declines in abundance. To assess their status in Scotland, 103 field surveys were undertaken, including searches of 50 of the 77 native pinewood sites, traversing a total of 902 km. Hydnoid fungi were encountered on 30 of the searches (29/,,), primarily in eastern regions of Scotland. A maximum of 8 species was recorded on a single search, 11 species being encountered in total. Of 22 plantation sites surveyed, 11 were found to contain populations of hydnoid fungi. Four species were relatively widespread, both in native woodlands and plantations: Bankera fuligi-neoalba, Hydnellum peckii, Phellodon tomentosum, and Sarcodon imbricatits. All species tended to be associated with particular microsites, especially riverbanks, tracksides or areas of exposed mineral soil; median Values for percentage bare ground cover surrounding each sporome were generally above 50\%. Median values for diameter at breast height (dbh) of associated trees were in the ranue 20-50 cm for all species. Data from the field surveys were pooled with previous records to assess the number of hydnoid species recorded for each native pine woodland. When examined by regression, a positive relationship was recorded between the number of species and woodland area ((r)2 = 0.69, P <0.001, n = 50). To assess the occurrence of declines, the number of 10 km gridsquares for each species was compared using records made pre- and post-1970. These data provided evidence for declines in only four of the 17 species considered. However, 12 species are threatened with extinction according to the IUCN Red List criteria, owing to their restricted patterns of distribution. The implications of these results for the conservation of hydnoid fungi in Scotland are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Measurements of C-13 in fungal sporocarps are useful in assessing mycorrhizal or saprotrophic status. Because C-14 measurements can indicate the age of fungal carbon (C) and mycorrhizal fungi depend closely on recent photosynthate, C-14 may provide additional insight into possible mycorrhizal status. Sporocarps, needles, and litter from Woods Creek, OR, USA together with archived sporocarps were measured for C-14 content by accelerator mass spectrometry. Known mycorrhizal fungi resembled current-year needles (Amanita, Cantharellus and Gomphidius) or atmospheric CO2 (Tuber) in C-14 and indicated an average age of 0-2 yr for incorporated C, whereas saprotrophic genera (Pleurocybella , Lepiota and Hypholoma) were composed of C at least 10 yr old. Of genera tentatively considered mycorrhizal from previous work with C-13, only Otidia and Sowerbyella appeared mycorrhizal from C-14 measurements, whereas Aleuria, Clavulina, Paurocotylis and Ramaria (sensu lato) consisted of older carbon and were presumably saprotrophic. C-14 clearly separated known mycorrhizal or saprotrophic fungi and indicated C-13 measurements should be interpreted cautiously on species of unknown status. C-14 results for needles and mycorrhizal fungi suggested that C sources other than atmospheric CO2 may contribute small amounts of C. Possible sources include storage of carbohydrates and amino acids, organic nitrogen uptake, and incorporation of soil-respired CO2 by anaplerotic or photosynthetic pathways.

AB  - Insects are known to disseminate fungal propagules to decaying wood. Their effect on the diversity of the decomposer mycota is so far unexplored. Sixteen Norway spruces (Picea abies) were felled and cut into 50 cm long bolts which were placed in four managed and four natural stands in southern Finland. The bolts were covered with net cages to prevent insect access. Half of the net cages were opened during each spring for 3 weeks. After 28-30 months, the bolts were investigated for insect marks, dry weight loss, and a batch of them was taken for fungal isolations. The fungal isolates were first divided into morphologically distinguishable taxonomic genera or species and further into operational chemotaxonomical units (OCTUs) by their combined fatty acid and sterol profiles (FAST-profiles). The number of insect marks (holes and gnawings) found on the bolts after 28-30 months varied from 0 to 6400/m(2) depending on the site and on whether the net cage was opened during spring or not. The bolts were attacked mainly by two bark beetle species, Trypodendron lineatum and Hylurgops palliatus. Boring and gnawing marks of these beetles were significantly more common on bolts in managed than in natural sites. Bolt dry weight loss correlated positively (r = 0.461, P < 0.001) with the number of insect marks on them. The fungal isolates (737) were divided into 145 OCTUs and the number of OCTUs per bolt varied from 1 to 12 with a mean of 8.1. The fungal diversity of the bolts (i.e. number of OCTUs per bolt or the Shannon-Wiener index) varied according to the number of H. palliatus gnawings, stand management and between tree individuals. The number of OCTUs per bolt correlated negatively with the number of H. palliatus marks, but even though more beetle marks were found on bolts of managed forest sites, the fungal diversity of the spruce bolts there was not lower than in natural stands. Forest management appears to increase fungal diversity in decaying spruce bolts but the effect is low. The results stress the importance of insect attacks to the decomposition process and fungal diversity of fresh woody debris. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A number of recent review articles on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community diversity have highlighted the unprecedented increase in the number of publications on this ecologically important but neglected area. The general features of these species-rich, highly dynamic and complex communities have been comprehensively covered but one aspect crucial to our assessment of diversity, namely the sampling of ECM communities has received less attention. This is a complex issue with two principal components, the physical sampling strategy employed and the life cycle traits of the ECM fungi being examined. Combined, these two components provide the image that we perceive as ECM diversity. This contribution will focus primarily on the former of these components using a recent study from a pine forest in central Sweden to highlight some sampling problems and also to discuss some features common to ECM communities. The two commonly used elements of diversity, species richness and community evenness, present rather different problems in the assessment of ECM diversity. The applicability of using current measures of abundance (number or percentage of root tips colonised) to determine community evenness is discussed in relation to our lack of knowledge on the size of individual genets of ECM fungi. The inherent structure of most ECM communities, with a few common species and a large number of rare species, severely limits our ability to accurately assess species richness. A discussion of theoretical detection limits is included that demonstrates the importance of the sampling effort (no. of samples or tips) involved in assessing species richness. Species area abundance plots are also discussed in this context. It is suggested that sampling strategy (bulk samples versus multiple collections of single tips) may have important consequences when sampling from communities where root tip densities differ. Finally, the need for studies of the spatial distribution of ECM on roots in relation to small-scale soil heterogeneity and of the temporal aspects of ECM community dynamics is raised.

AB  - At high latitudes, decomposition rates and soil nitrogen (N) availability are pivotal in determining ecosystem responses to climate change. The effects of temperature, soil moisture content, resource quality, and saprotrophic fungi as an example of soil organisms, on carbon (C) and N mineralisation are reviewed. The controls on N availability are less well characterised than those on decomposition, and C and net N mineralisation sometimes do not respond to these controls in a parallel manner. Increases in mean summer temperatures of 2-4degreesC predicted for high latitudes may not necessarily cause greater rates of decomposition and N mineralisation because of concomitant small rises in soil temperature together with interactions between the controls, including interactions of the temperature and moisture content of the substrata with the diversity and function of decomposer fungi. Research on decomposition and soil N availability has been carried out at several scales, at all of which future research remains necessary. It is not clear whether species diversity of decomposer fungi influences decomposition and C and N release above the microscale.

AB  - Classic ectomycorrhizal symbioses are mutualisms that involve the exchange of fixed carbon for mineral nutrients between plant roots and fungi. They are unique in the way they contain features of both intimate and diffuse symbioses. The degree of host specificity varies, particularly among the fungi. Here we examine two exceptional cases of specificity to see what they tell us about the advantages of specificity, how it is initiated, and the potential role that it plays in complex ecosystems. The first case involves non-photosynthetic epiparasitic plants, which contrary to virtually all other plants, exhibit high levels of specificity toward their fungal hosts. The second case involves suilloid fungi; this is the largest monophyletic group of ectomycorrhizal fungi that is essentially restricted to associations with a single plant family. In both cases, new symbioses are initiated by dormant propagules, that are stimulated to germinate by chemical cues from the host. This reduces the cost of wasting propagules on non-hosts. The advantages of specificity remain unclear in both cases, but we argue that increased benefit to the specialist may result from specialized physiological adaptations. We reexamme the idea that specialist fungi may help their hosts compete in complex ecosystems by reducing facultative epiparasitism by other plants, and suggest an alternative hypothesis for the observed pattern.

AB  - We investigated soil quality growth effects on Folsomia candida (Willem) (Collembola) in microcosm experiments. A high-quality forest soil (andosols) and pure sand were used as substrates in one experiment and soil quality was controlled by mixing the two soils using 25, 50, and 100\% forest soil to sand (vol/vol basis). A higher forest soil to sand ratio increased microbial biomass N, total C (TC), and total N (TN) contents, soil respiration, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Collembolan body length increased with increasing proportions of forest soil. In another experiment using seven forest soils, collembolan growth was compared with soil parameters such as organic matter content, TC, TN, soil pH, microbial biomass (C, N, and P), and respiration. Growth was greater in soils with lower microbial biomass and higher microbial N/P ratio. Since higher microbial N/P indicated a higher percentage of bacteria] biomass, we concluded that collembolan growth reflected soil biological quality, especially bacterial activity.

AB  - Interactions between mycelia of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus variegatus and the wood decomposing fungus Hypholoma fasciculare were studied in soil microcosms. The ectomycorrhizal mycelium extended from Pinus sylvestris seedlings and the saprotrophic fungus grew out into the soil from birch wood blocks of two alternative sizes. Transfer of P-32 between the interacting mycelia was measured nondestructively using electronic auto radiography. The outcome of the interactions was clearly affected by the size of the wood blocks. In systems with large wood blocks (1.6 cm(3)) the wood decomposer fungus overgrew the mycelium of the mycorrhizal fungus whereas in systems with small wood blocks (0.44 cm(3)) the mycorrhizal mycelium overgrew the wood decomposer fungus. The saprotrophic fungus was able to capture significantly more P-32 from labelled mycorrhizal mycelium when growing out from larger wood blocks. The mycorrhizal fungus was able to capture significantly more P-32 from labelled saprotrophic mycelium when the wood blocks were smaller. (C) 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB  - A pathway for the transfer of nutrients from dead nematodes to mycorrhizal plants is described for the first time. Plants of Betula pendula were grown in transparent microcosms in the mycorrhizal (M) or non-mycorrhizal (NM) condition, either with or without nematode necromass of known nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents as the major potential source of these elements. Plants colonized by the mycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus produced greater yields and had larger N and P contents in the presence of nematodes than did their NM counterparts. The symbiotic systems were shown to exploit the N and P originally contained in necromass more effectively, and to transfer the nutrients to the plants in quantities approximately double those seen in NM systems. Even so, NM plants obtained sufficient N and P from dead nematodes to enable some enhancement of growth. Our observations confirm that mycorrhizal fungi provide the potential for the recycling of nutrients contained in this quantitatively important component of the soil mesofauna and demonstrate that the symbiotic pathway is considerably more effective than that provided by saprotrophs alone. The consequences of this nutrient transfer pathway for nutrient recycling in temperate forest ecosystems are considered.

AB  - Exotic pine plantations are promoted for their presumed capacity to provide a net sink of atmospheric C. Millions of hectares worldwide will be subjected to conversion into plantations during the next decades. However, pine introductions are known to result in a marked depletion of soil C, a phenomenon which has remained unexplained. We studied plantations in paramo grasslands of Ecuador, where the effect of the exotic introduction of radiata pines (Pinus radiata) and their accompanying ectomycorrhizal fungi can be studied in isolation from other ecosystem disturbances. We suggest that ectomycorrhizal fungi can extract C previously accumulated by paramo grasslands based on (a) a drastic simplification of the ectomycorrhizal community shown by direct DNA identification, (b) a loss of up to 30\% soil C within <20 years of plantation, (c) stable C isotope values in fungal fruitbodies which are closer to grassland than pi tie values, and (d) radiocarbon dating of fruitbodies indicating relatively old C sources for fruitbody formation. Species number in the ectomycorrhizal guild drops to only three fungal species per plantation compared to approximately 100 in comparable native pine stands. Our results provide evidence for a dynamic role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in soil C processing, and question the strategy of introducing pine plantations as a general solution to reduce mounting atmospheric CO2 levels.

AB  - Effects of irrigation and liquid fertilization on fine root (< 1 mm) production and longevity, and fine root (< 0.5-2 mm) biomass were studied in a Norway spruce (Picea. abies (L.) Karst.) stand in northern Sweden. Fine root length production and longevity were measured by the minirhizotron technique at 0-10 cm depth in the following treatments: irrigation (I), liquid fertilization (IL) and control (C). Standing root biomass and root length density (RLD) were studied in the litter-fermented humus (LFH) layer and at depths of 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm using soil cores in solid fertilized (F) and C plots. Minirhizotrons were installed in October 1994 and measurements recorded monthly from July to September 1995 and during the growing season in 1996. Soil cores were sampled in 1996. Fine root production increased significantly in IL plots compared with C plots, but the I treatment did not increase root production. Root mortality increased significantly in IL plots compared with C plots. Fine root longevity in IL plots was significantly lower compared with C and I plots. No significant difference was found between longevity of fine roots in I and C plots. Compared with C, F treatment increased fine root biomass in the LFH and mineral soil layers, and increased the amount of fine roots in mineral soil layers relative to the LFH layer. Furthermore, F increased RLD and the number of mycorrhizal root tips significantly.

AB  - Nitrogen retention and recycling are topics of enduring interest in ecosystem ecology, yet we lack a mechanistic field-tested model of how these processes work in unpolluted, old-growth temperate forests. Forests of the Cordillera Piuchue Ecosystem Study (CPES) in southern Chile provide an opportunity to examine nitrogen cycling and retention in a forest that is virtually free of human disturbance. We applied N-15 pool dilution and pulse-chase tracer techniques as complementary approaches within small plots to understand flows of inorganic nitrogen in the surface soil of an evergreen mixed-angio sperm forest. We also followed separate pulses of (NH4+)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 for two years to gain insights into how short-term mechanisms of inorganic nitrogen cycling translate into long-term patterns of ecosystem nitrogen retention. Strong consumption appears to limit losses of NH4+ and NO3- from this forest, and predominantly by the same mechanisms for both forms of nitrogen. As a result, the extent of (NH4-)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 retention were also similar, yet similar to 44-fold higher rates of gross NH4+ production leads to the dominance of NH4+ over NO3- in soil and stream waters. Microbial biomass played a key role in the short-term assimilation of N-15 tracers, but retention was only transient. Turnover of N-15 through microbial biomass was rapid and appeared to be only weakly retained in soil exchangeable pools, fine roots, and soil organic matter, resulting in substantial losses of N-15 from soils within weeks of tracer additions. Assimilation of N-15 into fine roots was a much larger sink (13\%) than has been reported for other forested ecosystems (1-3\%), and the transport of N-15 from microbial biomass to aboveground sinks in vegetation may explain the observed loss of N-15 from surface soils over time. Losses of N-15 from microbial biomass did not enter the extractable pool of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), suggesting that DON losses do not originate directly from active microbial turnover, and also that microbial activity may not exert as much control over hydrologic losses of DON as compared to losses of NH4+ and NO3- Our results also suggest an additional rapid and extremely transient (1 d) mechanism of NO3- retention via incorporation into extractable-DON. The long-term retention of N-15 at the whole-plot level did not differ significantly between (NH4-)-N-15 and 15NO3- treatments, and averaged 65\% after two years. The lack of an appreciable change in 15N recovery for similar to1.5 yr following the initial assimilation, redistribution, and loss of N-15 suggests that the majority of N-15 was not recycled over the long term through inorganic. nitrogen pools and microbial biomass via mineralization/immobilization pathways. Instead, long-term retention of inorganic N-15 appeared to be dominated by rapid and possibly direct assimilation into a slow-turnover pool of soil organic matter. Elevated N-15 contents in fine-root and microbial pools for up to two years after N-15 additions, however, also indicated sustained biotic retention of inorganic nitrogen. Our results suggest very similar retention of NH4+ and NO3- that is dominated by rapid assimilation and turnover through microbial biomass in the short term (weeks), and transfer from microbial biomass into nitrogen-conserving plant (and to a lesser extent soil organic matter) pools in the long term (years). These processes result in efficient long-term retention of nitrogen in unpolluted old-growth temperate forests.

AB  - To quantify and characterize N and C isotopic fractionation effects due to fungal transformation of organic substrates in forest ecosystems, we performed a field study in California and a meta-analysis of three additional studies conducted by others across the Northern Hemisphere. Basidiomycete fungal biomass was consistently enriched for the heavier isotope for C relative to substrate and either enriched or depleted for N relative to atmospheric N. Extent and pattern of fractionation was very variable, but the distinction between ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic basidiomycetes was strongly supported, particularly when dual isotope analyses were performed. This differentiation, which we call the ``EM-SAP Divide{''} holds for studies within a restricted ecosystem, but becomes less distinct over larger geographical regions, removing the rationale for using direct isotopic values from single specimens as diagnostic of ecophysiological role. For C, the EM-SAP Divide seems to reflect substrate effects, potentially due to differential access to recently synthesized versus recycled organic compounds, rather than distinct physiological pathways. Once substrate and ecophysiological role effects are removed, our meta-analysis suggests the existence of more than one mechanism causing C fractionations in fungi which is found equally in ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi. Similarly, a multimodal distribution of delta N-15 values suggests that physiological effects may play a much stronger influence on N natural isotopic distributions in fungi. Our meta-analysis provides a firm statistical base to evaluate fungal ecological statements based on natural isotopic distributions of C and N. We call into question the current practice of using direct isotopic measurements to make statements about trophic relationships of fungi in the absence of other supporting evidence.

AB  - Very large quantities of pollen are released annually by wind-pollinated trees, which dominate northern forest ecosystems. Since pollen is enriched in both nitrogen and phosphorus, this recurrent pulse of deposition constitutes a significant potential source of these elements in what are known to be severely nutrient-limited systems. Here, we demonstrate for the first time? to our knowledge, that an ectomycorrhizal fungus, Paxillus involutus, is able to scavenge effectively for nitrogen and phosphorus in pollen and to return a significant proportion of each nutrient to its autotrophic host, Betula pendula. More than 75 and 96\%, respectively, of the nitrogen and phosphorus were removed from pollen in microcosms containing the mycorrhizal fungus, 29 and 25\%, respectively being transferred to the plants. In contrast, in microcosms without the mycorrhizal fungus only 42 and 35\%, respectively, of nitrogen and phosphorus were lost from the pollen, presumably as a result of export by saprotrophs, and only 12 and 7\%. respectively were transferred to the plants. We hypothesize that this process of resource recapture, by contributing significantly to the ability of the trees to sustain the necessary annual investment in pollen production, will have a major impact upon their reproductive capabilities and hence `fitness'.

AB  - Commonly reported effects of pine on topsoil include acidification, a decrease in biological activity, and an accumulation of surface organic matter. Such effects have not been documented for Mediterranean woodland and scrubland areas. This research evaluated humus profiles beneath pine and adjacent vegetation on the basis of previous knowledge on soil animal communities and vegetation. Two Mediterranean sites with aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis P, Mill.) and scrubland vegetation were compared, one in Spain (Navarre), the other in Italy (Sicily), Humus profiles were sampled under main vegetation types, comprising aleppo pine, rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L,), and bare ground in both sites, along transects with increasing pine influence. Quantitative morphological methods were used to analyze and compare humus profiles, and data were analyzed using correspondence analysis. In both sites the influence of aleppo pine on humus forms was well-defined but minor, increasing the appearance of an Oe horizon characterized by intense activity of litter-dwelling Fauna and fungi, Under all vegetation types, and in both sites, the organomineral A horizon was of the mull type, although the composition of the soil-building fauna varied between Navarre and Sicily, There was more heterogeneity among vegetation types in Navarre, where aleppo pine was planted on derelict land, than in Sicily where aleppo pine was a component of natural vegetation (maquis), A decreasing influence of pine was perceptible in the inner edge of the pine plantation in Navarre, or under the crown of individual trees in Sicily.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) toxicity may limit the growth and nutrient acquisition of sensitive tree species in regions receiving acidic deposition. Symbioses between tree roots and mycorrhizal fungi may offset the negative impacts of Al in the root zone. Liriodendron tulipifera L. (tulip-poplar) is an important tree species in the Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern United States and may be at risk from the high levels of acidic deposition in that area. Mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal tulip-poplar seedlings were exposed to Al levels of 0, 50, 100, and 200 muM in sand culture for 6 weeks. Mycorrhizal plants accumulated two to seven times the shoot and root biomass of non-mycorrhizal plants and demonstrated no decreases in biomass with Al exposure. Non-mycorrhizal plants exhibited significant reductions in biomass at and above 100 muM Al. Aluminum toxicity in non-mycorrhizal plants appears to be the result of the disruption of P translocation to leaves and Ca, Mg, P, Cu, and Zn uptake in roots. Mycorrhizal plants accumulated 2 and 1.5 times the concentration of Al in shoots and roots, respectively, indicating that Al resistance was not associated with the exclusion of Al from the plant. Patterns of labile Al in solution, nutrients, and Al accumulation in tissues suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal ecotypes may alter the form or compartmentation of Al within the rhizosphere and plant, thus protecting seedlings from the effects of exposure to Al in the soil solution.

AB  - Translocation of nutrients through fungal mycelia has mainly been viewed in terms of unidirectional movement from sources to sinks. This paper describes an experiment designed to test the possibility of bidirectional phosphorus transport in mycelial cords of the white rot fungus Hypholoma fasciculare growing in soil microcosms. A novel technique is described that uses the different energy spectra of the radioactive phosphorus isotopes P-32 and P-33, in combination with nondestructive electronic autoradiography, to monitor the distribution of the two isotopes within single mycelial cord systems. The tracer isotopes were applied to pairs of wood blocks connected by mycelial cords, and isotope translocations were monitored during a 29-d period. Significant amounts of phosphorus were transported in both directions simultaneously between the two colonized wood blocks. Simultaneous, bidirectional translocation of phosphorus occurs in mycelial cords of H. fasciculare. Such circulation,of nutrients in fungal mycelia should equalize differences in nutrient concentrations in different parts of the mycelia, enabling net translocation of nutrients from areas of high nutrient availability to those of high nutrient demand.

AB  - Fallen logs of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) at various stages of decomposition were sampled from undisturbed and 1-, 14-, and 28-year-old post-fire and post-harvest sites in northern Alberta and studied for differences in the associated microfungus communities. Wood samples were plated directly onto each of six different media and, from these, fungal species were identified and enumerated over a 24-month period. Approximately 10 000 isolates were obtained, representing 292 species of filamentous microfungi, including 41 ascomycetes, 29 zygomycetes, and 222 mitosporic fungi. The most commonly isolated species were Trichoderma viride (Gray) Pers., Rhinocladiella atrovirens Nannf., Penicillium pinophilum Hedgcock, and Mortierella ramanniana (Moller) Linnem. Cluster analysis and ordination of microfungus communities in logs showed that the tree species of the log had the greatest influence on the species composition of communities. Fungus community composition was also correlated with the stage of decomposition. Species richness was highest in logs from undisturbed sites and lowest in logs from the most recently disturbed sites. Species diversity (Shannon-Weaver) was only slightly higher at undisturbed sites than at disturbed sites. The most significant environmental factor was log moisture, which increased proportionately with stage of decomposition and was significantly correlated with climatic factors.

AB  - We investigated the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ambient + 200 ppm) on fine root production and soil carbon dynamics in a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forest subject to free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) near Durham, NC (USA). Live fine root mass (LFR) showed less seasonal variation than dead fine root mass (DFR), which was correlated with seasonal changes in soil moisture and soil temperature. LFR mass increased significantly (by 86\%) in the elevated CO2 treatment, with an increment of 37 g(dry weight) m(-2) above the control plots after two years of CO2 fumigation. There was no long-term increment in DFR associated with elevated CO2, but significant seasonal accumulations of DFR mass occurred during the summer of the second year of fumigation. Overall, root net primary production (RNPP) was not significantly different, but annual carbon inputs were 21.7 gC m(-2) y(-1) (68\%) higher in the elevated CO2 treatment compared to controls. Specific root respiration was not altered by the CO2 treatment during most of the year; however, it was significantly higher by 21\% and 13\% in September 1997 and May 1998, respectively, in elevated CO2. We did not find statistically significant differences in the C/N ratio of the root tissue, root decomposition or phosphatase activity in soil and roots associated with the treatment. Our data show that the early response of a loblolly pine forest ecosystem subject to CO2 enrichment is an increase in its fine root population and a trend towards higher total RNPP after two years of CO2 fumigation.

AB  - There is evidence that forest management practices influence soil-decomposer communities. It is also established that changes in the trophic structure and composition of these communities can induce changes in soil-nutrient dynamics, thereby affecting plant growth. Whether forest productivity is affected by management-induced changes in, e.g. soil faunal structure, is, however, yet to be shown. The aim of this study was (1) to determine the resolution of the ecological hierarchy (e.g. species, functional groups, trophic levels) at which a change in soil fauna would alter biotically-controlled processes in soils, and (2) to examine the sensitivity of soil fauna of the boreal forest floor to various kinds of forest management practices. A review of laboratory miniecosystem experiments carried out at the University of Jyvaskyla: is presented to examine the diversity-ecosystem function relationship. The response of tree growth to manipulation of soil-faunal composition was measured. A field experiment was conducted in central Finland in spruce stands, including several stand management treatments in addition to the untreated controls. The fellings took place in winter 1996, and various groups of soil animals have been sampled since 1995. Laboratory experiments revealed that soil processes and plant growth are largely insensitive to changes taking place at the species level of soil fauna. Some important keystone species may exist, but a change in the functional group architecture seems to be a prerequisite for altered rates in soil processes. Predators high up in the detrital food web had no detectable influence on any of the ecosystem-level processes. In the field, all of the faunal groups studied proved to be highly insensitive to the stand management practices. As compared to the untreated controls, numbers of enchytraeid worms, collembolans and most of the macroarthropods in the managed stands were not significantly different. It is concluded that management practices with minor impacts on the soil organic layer, which buffers soil biota against drastic changes in their environment, have little influence on biotically-controlled soil processes.

AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) associated with trees and shrubs plays a major role in the functioning of many ecosystems, from natural woodlands to plantations and agroforestry systems, but it is surprisingly difficult to quantify the amounts of N-2 fixed. Some of the problems involved in measuring N-2 fixation by woody perennials include: (a) diversity in occurrence, and large plant-to-plant variation in growth and nodulation status of N-2-fixing species, especially in natural ecosystems; (b) long-term, perennial nature of growth and the seasonal or year-to-year changes in patterns of N assimilation; and (c) logistical limitations of working with mature trees which are generally impossible to harvest in their entirety. The methodology which holds most promise to quantify the contributions of N-2 fixation to trees is the so-called `N-15 natural abundance' technique which exploits naturally occurring differences in N-15 composition between plant-available N sources in the soil and that of atmospheric N-2. In this review we discuss probable explanations for the origin of the small differences in N-15 abundance found in different N pools in both natural and man-made ecosystems and utilise previously published information and unpublished data to examine the potential advantages and limitations inherent in the application of the technique to study N-2 fixation by woody perennials. Calculation of the proportion of the plant N derived from atmospheric N-2 (\%Ndfa) using the natural abundance procedure requires that both the N-15 natural abundance of the N derived from BNF and that derived from the soil by the target N-2-fixing species be determined. It is then assumed that the N-15 abundance of the N-2-fixing species reflects the relative contributions of the N derived from these two sources. The N-15 abundance of the N derived from BNF (B) can vary with micro-symbiont, plant species/provenance and growth stage, all of which create considerable difficulties for its precise evaluation. If the \%Ndfa is large and the N-15 abundance of the N acquired from other sources is not several delta(15)N units higher or lower than B, then this can be a major source of error. Further difficulties can arise in determining the N-15 abundance of the N derived from soil (and plant litter, etc.) by the target plant as it is usually impossible to predict which, if any, non-N-2-fixing reference species will obtain N from the same N sources in the same proportions with the same temporal and spatial patterns as the N-2-fixing perennial. The compromise solution is to evaluate the N-15 abundance of a diverse range of neighbouring non-N-2-fixing plants and to compare these values with that of the N-2-fixing species and the estimate of B. Only then can it be determined whether the contribution of BNF to the target species can be quantified with any degree of confidence. This review of the literature suggests that while the natural abundance technique appears to provide quantitative measures of BNF in tree plantation and agroforestry systems, particular difficulties may arise which can often limit its application in natural ecosystems.

AB  - Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings were grown for 3 years in the ground in open top chambers and exposed to two concentrations of atmospheric CO2 (ambient or ambient + 400 mu mol mol(-1)) without addition of nutrients and water. Biomass production (above-ground and below-ground) and allocation, as well as canopy structure and tissue nitrogen concentrations and contents, were examined by destructive harvest after 3 years. Elevated CO2 increased total biomass production by 55\%, reduced needle area and needle mass as indicated, respectively, by lower leaf area ratio and leaf mass ratio. A relatively smaller total needle area was produced in relation to fine roots under elevated CO2 The proportion of dry matter in roots was increased by elevated CO2, as indicated by increased root-to-shoot ratio and root mass ratio. Within the root system, there was a significant shift in the allocation towards fine roots. Root litter constituted a much higher fi action of fine roots in trees grown in the elevated CO2 than in those grown in ambient CO2. Growth at elevated CO2 caused a significant decline in nitrogen concentration only in the needles, while nitrogen content significantly increased in branches and fine roots (with diameter less than 1 mm). There were no changes in crown structure (branch number and needle area distribution). Based upon measurements of growth made throughout the 3 years, the greatest increase in biomass under elevated CO, took place mainly at the beginning of the experiment, when trees grown in elevated CO2 had higher relative growth rates than those grown under ambient CO2; these differences disappeared with time. Symptoms of acclimation of trees to growth in the elevated CO2 treatment were observed and are discussed. (C) 2000 Annals of Botany Company.

AB  - In an in vitro study, interactions between ectomycorrhizal fungi, saprotrophic basidiomycetes and soil microfungi known from pine forests were examined in relation to different ammonium concentrations. The saprotrophic basidiomycetes Clitocybe marginella and C, vibecina and the soil microfungi Penicillium pinetorum, Oidiodendron flavum and Torulomyces lagena were grown against the ectomycorrhizal Cenococcum geophilum, Laccaria bicolor and Rhizopogon luteolus. Interactions were species specific and overgrowth was the most common (43 \%), followed by inhibition at distance (26\%) and contact inhibition (16\%). Ammonium concentrations affected the type and strength of the interactions. The competitive strength of the ectomycorrhizal fungi was relatively high and only the growth of the mycelia of L. bicolor was clearly suppressed by the Clitocybe spp. The interactions are discussed in relation to the ecology of the fungi and potential future studies.

AB  - Interspecific variation in polyphenol production by plants has been interpreted in terms of defense against herbivores. Several recent lines of evidence suggest that polyphenols also influence the pools and fluxes of inorganic and organic soil nutrients. Such effects could have far-ranging consequences for nutrient competition among and between plants and microbes, and for ecosystem nutrient cycling and retention. The significance of polyphenols for nutrient cycling and plant productivity is still uncertain, but it could provide an alternative or complementary explanation for the variability in polyphenol production by plants.

AB  - This paper reviews the knowledge on crowberry (Empetrum nigrum ssp. nigrum and ssp. hermaphroditum) dominated ecosystems in the Nordic region. Empetrum leaves and litter have high phenolic content resulting in slow decomposition, and with the formation of an organic top soil, nutrients are kept in an organic nutrient bank in the soil mainly available for plants with ericoid mycorrhiza. Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum is a strong nutrient competitor and outcompetes most plants in late successional stages. This is due to chemical interference (allelopathy) and resource competition. Crowberry as an organism is resistant to atmospheric pollution and may even increase in vigor by high atmospheric N deposition in nemoral coastal heaths, but is very sensitive to mechanical disturbances and fire. However, there are indications that the closed nutrient cycle established when Empetrum is dominant may be disturbed after airborne inputs of inorganic N.

AB  - Most work on root proliferation to a localized nutrient supply has ignored the possible role of mycorrhizal fungi, despite their key role in nutrient acquisition. Interactions between roots of Plantago lanceolata, an added arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) inoculum and nitrogen capture from an organic patch (Lolium perenne shoot material) dual-labelled with N-15 and C-13 were investigated, to determine whether root proliferation and nitrogen (N) capture was affected by the presence of AM fungi. Decomposition of the organic patch in the presence and absence of roots peaked in all treatments at day 3, as shown by the amounts of (CO2)-C-13 detected in the soil atmosphere. Plant N concentrations were higher in the treatments with added inoculum 10 d after patch addition, but thereafter did not differ among treatments. Plant phosphorus concentrations at the end of the experiment were depressed by the addition of the organic residue in the absence of mycorrhizal inoculum. Although uninoculated plants were also colonized by mycorrhizal fungi, colonization was enhanced at all times by the added inoculum. Addition of the AM inoculum increased root production, observed in situ by the use of minirhizotron tubes, most pronouncedly within the organic patch zone. Patch N capture by the end of the experiment was c. 7.5\% and was not significantly different as a result of adding an AM inoculum. Furthermore, no C-13 enrichments were detected in the plant material in any of the treatments showing that intact organic compounds were not taken up. Thus, although the added. AM fungal inoculum benefited P. lanceolata seedlings in terms of P concentrations of tissues it did not increase total N capture or affect the form in which N was captured by P. lanceolata roots.

AB  - Fruit-bodies of hypogeous fungi were sampled over two seasons across 136 forested study sites representing a stratified sample of the climatic, geological and topographic features of far south-eastern mainland Australia. Two hundred and nine species, over three-quarters being undescribed, were recorded. Statistical models based on various environmental attributes measured for each site were developed for the occurrence of several common taxa. At a landscape scale, climatic factors such as mean minimum temperature of the coldest month and annual mean moisture index were important explanatory variables for most taxa examined, but the type of response varied. More locally, topographic position, soil fertility, time since last fire and micro-habitat structures such as the leaf litter layer and number of large fallen trees also influenced the distribution of taxa in different ways. A model was then developed for the number of fungal species occurring at each site. Important explanatory variables were type of substrate, topography and diversity of potential host eucalypt species. The utility of each model constructed needs evaluation by further sampling of hypogeous fungi. Possible implications of our findings for forest management are discussed. Further analyses of our existing data are also identified.

AB  - Fifty-three species (477 samples) of dominating agaricoid basidiomycetes (AB) from 14 families were tested for presence of bioactive metabolites. Effect of these substances on bacteria, actinomycetes and micromycetes isolated from both hyphosphere of studied AB and soil outside their colonies was investigated. Standard tests were applied as well. Water extracts from studied AB basidiomes inhibited growth of grampositive bacteria and/or yeasts. Water extracts was shown to be active also against soil micromycetes and usually eliminated Penicillium thomii (inhibited in 59.06 \% of studied AB), P. nigricans (56.25 \%) and Micromucur ramannianus (73.58 \%) from AB colonies. At the same time P, purpurogenum, Pseudomonas fluorescens and some other bacteria and actinomycetes isolated from AB colonies appeared to be resistant to bioactive metabolites of studied AB. This data agrees well with typical effect of studied AB species on soil biota and shows perspectives for further confirmation of hypothesis on allelochemical activity of AB as regulators of the structure of microbial communities in forest soils and litter.

AB  - On the basis of the evidence that insect fungivory has the potential to affect fungal reproductive fitness, we investigated the effects of two specialist ciid beetles (Octotemnus glabriculus and Cis boleti) on the reproductive potential of their host fungus, Coriolus versicolor. We found, from field data, a negative correlation between the number of individuals of O. glabriculus inhabiting C. versicolor fruit bodies and the percentage of the fungal spore-producing surface (hymenium) that was functional. By contrast, the number of C. boleti inhabiting C. versicolor fruit bodies did not correlate with the percentage of functional hymenium. Experimentally, O. glabriculus and C. boleti reduced the reproductive potential of C. versicolor by 58\% and 30\%, respectively, whereas the combined trophic activity of both beetles caused a reduction of 64\%. This latter effect was not significantly different from that caused by O. glabriculus alone. These findings disagree with previous assertions that insect fungivory on fruit bodies has only neutral effects on fungal fitness. We conclude that in the short-term, fungivory by ciids significantly decreases the area of functional hymenium of C. versicolor and is likely to reduce fungal reproductive fitness. Within this perspective the evolution of certain fungal characteristics (i.e. chemical composition, consistency and phenology) can be interpreted as being driven by fungivory.

AB  - The main aim of this study was to test various hypotheses regarding the changes in delta(13)C of emitted CO2 that follow the addition of C-4-sucrose to the soil of a C-3-ecosystem. It forms part of an experimental series designed to assess whether or not the contributions from C-3-respiration (root and microbial) and C-4-respiration (microbial) to total soil respiration can be calculated from such changes. A series of five experiments, three on sieved (root-free) mor-layer material, and two in the field with intact mor-layer (and consequently with active roots), were performed. Both in the experiments on sieved mor-layer and the field experiments, we found a C-4-sucrose-induced increase in C-3-respiration that accounted for between 30\% and 40\% of the respiration increase 1 h after sucrose addition. When the course of C-3-, C-4- and total respiration was followed in sieved material over four days following addition of C-4-sucrose, the initially increased respiration of C-3-C was transient, passing within less than 24 h. In a separate pot experiment, neither ectomycorrhizal Pinus sylvestris L. roots nor non-mycorrhizal roots of this species showed respiratory changes in response to exogenous sucrose. No shift in the delta(13)C of the evolved CO2 after adding C-3-sucrose to sieved mor-layer material was found, confirming that the sucrose-induced increase in respiration of endogenous C was not an artefact of discrimination against C-13 during respiration. Furthermore, we conclude that the C-4-sucrose induced transient increase in C-3-respiration is most likely the result of accelerated turnover of C in the microbial biomass. Thus, neither respiration of mycorrhizal roots, nor processes discriminating against delta(13)C were likely sources of error in the field. The estimated delta(13)C of evolved soil CO2 in three field experiments lay between -25.2 parts per thousand and -23.6 parts per thousand. The study shows that we can distinguish between CO2 evolved from microbial mineralisation of added C-4-sucrose, and CO2 evolved from endogenous carbon sources (roots and microbial respiration).

AB  - The natural abundance of C-13 and N-15 was measured in basidiocarps of at least 115 species in 88 genera of ectomycorrhizal, wood-decomposing and litter-decomposing fungi from Japan and Malaysia. The natural abundance of C-13 and N-15 was also measured in leaves, litter, soil and wood from three different sites. N-15 and C-13 were enriched in ectomycorrhizal and wood-decomposing fungi, respectively, relative to their substrates. Ectomycorrhizal and wood-decomposing fungi could be distinguished on the basis of their delta(13)C and delta(15)N signatures. Although there was high variability in the isotopic composition of fungi, the following isotope-enrichment factors (epsilon, mean +/- SD) of the fungi relative to substrates were observed: epsilon(ectomycorrhizal fungi/litter) = 6.1 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand N-15 epsilon(ectomycorrhizal fungi/wood) = 1.4 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand C-13 epsilon(wood decomposing fung/wood) = -0.6 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand N-15 epsilon(wood decomposing fungi/wood) = 3.5 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand, C-13 The basis of isotope fractionation in C metabolism from mood to wood-decomposing fungus is discussed.

AB  - The proposed mechanisms for the species diversity-function relationship in plant communities stress the recognition of functional properties of species, and interactions between plants and soil processes. As resource availability to plants is influenced by the architecture of decomposer food webs, it has been hypothesised that the diversity of decomposers can also control ecosystem processes, including primary production. We manipulated the complexity of soil animal communities in a miniecosystem experiment in which a boreal forest floor with birch seedlings infected with mycorrhizal fungi was created. The soil animal diversity ranged from zero to typical species richness of soil fauna (approximately 50 taxa) in coniferous forests. Between these extremes was a nested factorial design with manually assembled communities consisting of two sets of one-species, and two sets of five-species animal communities within Fungivorous and microbi-detritivorous trophic groups. To investigate the role of predators in system functioning, the miniecosystems with fungivorous and microbidetritivorous fauna were established either with or without mesostigmatid mites as top predators. The miniecosystems were incubated in a climate chamber with varying illumination and temperature regimes for 40 weeks. Our experiment provides evidence that primary productivity is generally insensitive to variation at the species level or even at the level of trophic groups. Although top predators generally reduced prey population size, no effect was found on system functioning. However; the removal of microbe- or detritus-feeding fauna, especially the microbi-detritivore Cognettia sphagnetorum reduced plant N uptake and accumulation of plant biomass. The functional importance of soil fauna was inversely related to the trophic position of the group. Our results suggest that ecosystem functioning is robust against species extinctions in belowground food webs, and that primary production is predominantly controlled by organisms at low trophic positions in the decomposer food web.

AB  - The overall effects of fire on ecosystems are complex, ranging from the reduction or elimination of aboveground biomass to impacts on belowground physical, chemical and microbial mediated processes. Since a key component of overall ecosystem sustainability occurs belowground, recovery is tied to the soil's physical, chemical, and biological functions and processes. Depending on several fire severity measures, changes in belowground components can be either beneficial or deleterious to the entire ecosystem. Low-impact burning can promote a herbaoeous flora, increase plant available nutrients, and thin overcrowded forests, all of which can foster healthy systems. Severe fires can often cause changes in successional rates, alter above- and belowground species composition, generate volatilization of nutrients and ash entrainment in smoke columns, produce rapid or decreased mineralization rates, alter C : N ratios, and result in subsequent nutrient losses through accelerated erosion, leaching or denitrification. In addition, changes in soil hydrologic functioning, degradation of soil physical properties, decreases in micro- and macrofauna, and alterations in microbial populations and associated processes can occur. The direct effect of fire on belowground systems is a result of the burning severity, which integrates aboveground fuel loading (live and dead), soil moisture and subsequent soil temperatures, and duration of the burn. The time for recovery of belowground systems will not only depend on the burning intensity and its effect on key ecosystem processes and components, but also on the previous land-use practices. Thus, the impacts of fire on belowground systems can be highly variable and may not be predictable. Our paper is a general review of the effects of fire on belowground systems with emphasis placed on the changes in physical. biogeochemical and biological properties of soils and the resulting consequences these changes have for ecosystem sustainability.

AB  - Soil respiration constitutes a major component of the global carbon cycle and is likely to be altered by climatic change. However, there is an incomplete understanding of the extent to which various processes contribute to total soil respiration, especially the contributions of root and rhizosphere respiration. Here, using a stable carbon isotope tracer, we separate thf relative contributions of root and soil heterotrophic respiration to total soil respiration in situ. The Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) facility in the Duke University Forest (NC) fumigates plots of an undisturbed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest with CO2 that is strongly depleted in C-13. This labeled CO2 is found in the soil pore space through live root and mycorrhizal respiration and soil heterotroph respiration of labile root exudates. By measuring the depletion of (CO2)-C-13 in the soil system, we found that the rhizosphere contribution to soil CO2 reflected the distribution of fine roots in the soil and that late in the growing season roots contributed 55\% of total soil respiration at the surface, This estimate may represent an upper limit on the contribution of roots to soil respiration because high atmospheric CO2 often increases in root density and/or root activity in the soil.

AB  - We studied the role of nematode predation in the functioning of detrital food webs assembled in microcosms. The microcosms contained defaunated humus and litter materials, a diverse microbial community with bacteria, fungi and protozoa, and a birch (Betula pendula) seedling infected with mycorrhizal fungi. Different levels of top-down control upon microbivorous nematodes were set up by assembling food webs either without predators, or in combinations with a specialist and a non-specialist predatory mite (Mesostigmata). The nematode community was composed of either (1) three species of bacterivorous, or (2) three species of fungivorous nematodes or (3) both groups together. After two growing periods for the birch (38 weeks), the microcosms were destructively sampled for animal and microbial biomasses, concentration of mineral N in the soil, plant biomass and plant N concentration. The specialist predator reduced biomasses of both bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematodes by more than 50\%, whereas the non-specialist predator weakly increased the biomass of fungivorous nematodes. Thus, under high predation pressure, the biomass of microbivores changed as predicted by trophic dynamic models assuming strong top-down control and uniformly behaving trophic levels. Despite this, microbial biomass was unaffected by the predators. However, microbial respiration increased slightly in the presence of predators. Assuming that microbial respiration correlates with microbial productivity, the increase in microbial respiration indicates a cascading productivity regulation. The composition of the microbivore community had only a minor effect on the outcome of the top-down control on microbes. The > 50\% reduction in nematode biomass and respiration coincided with < 16\% increase in microbial respiration and did not affect microbial biomass. Presence of the specialist predator slightly reduced soil NH4+ concentration in communities with fungivore nematodes but plant growth and N uptake remained unchanged. Thus, the structure of the community only weakly controlled nutrient mineralisation.

AB  - Hexazinone (active ingredient) was aerially applied as a pellet (Velpar ULW) and as a liquid (Velpar L) to watersheds in the Piedmont of Alabama, U.S.A., at the rate of 6.72 kg.ha(-1) (three times the prescribed rate for this site). An untreated watershed served as a control. We determined hexazinone half-life in days for Velpar ULW (plants, 26-59; litter, 55; bare soil, 68; soil under litter, 74) and for Velpar L (plants, 19-36; litter, 56; bare soil, 77; soil under litter, 275). Maximum stream concentrations of hexazinone (422 mu g.L-1 for Velpar ULW; 473 mu g.L-1 for Velpar L) were observed during application and resulted from direct overspray. Hexazinone stream concentrations peaked several times during stormflow in the first 30 days (56-70 mu g.L-1 for Velpar ULW; 145-230 mu g.L-1 for Velpar L) and were diluted three to five times 1.6 km downstream. Hexazinone metabolites were also monitored. Exposure of macroinvertebrates to hexazinone did not alter benthic community structure. Taxa richness, including pollution-sensitive insects, did not differ significantly between either hexazinone treatment and the control. Benthic macroinvertebrates in Piedmont streams of the southeastern United States appear insensitive to hexazinone at the exposures observed in this study.

AB  - This study reports results from the first explicit test of the ectomycorrhizal hypothesis for tropical monodominance in the Ituri Forest of the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), where the canopy tree Gilbertiodendron dewevrei forms large, monospecific stands. To test the hypothesis that ectomycorrhizae are important to the success of dominant species; we surveyed the mycorrhizal status of dominant species, as well as other common, but not dominant, species in the forest. The survey reveals that two dominant species, Gilbertiodendron dewevrei and Julbernardia seretii, form ectomycorrhizae and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae, while Cynometra alexandri, another dominant, forms only vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae. These results, along with those of other species in this and other forests, are discussed within the context of the ectomycorrhizal hypothesis for tropical mondominance. This study demonstrates that the relationship between EM and tropical monodominance is more complex than has been previously recognized.

AB  - Strains of Hebeloma representative of different climatic zones were grown in axenic culture at either 2 degrees C and 22 degrees or 6 degrees and 22 degrees. Culture filtrates were assayed for proteolytic activity using FITC labelled BSA as a substrate. Assays were run between 0-37 degrees. Growth at low temperature induced greater proteolytic activity (g(-1) D.W. mycelium). Many of the strains produced protease(s) which retained significant activity at temperatures as low as 0 degrees, and a thermal optimum between 0-6 degrees with a second optimum at higher temperature. The results are discussed in relation the nutrient acquisition potential of ectomycorrhizal fungi at low temperature and the contribution such cold active proteases might make to the soil enzyme pool.

AB  - Interactions between effects of insect defoliators on tree physiology and growth and soil nutrient and water availability are poorly understood, We addressed whether the western spruce budworm influences nutrient and water relations, ectomycorrhizae, leaf gas exchange, and growth of Douglas-fir seedlings under different environmental conditions. Four-year-old, potted seedlings were grown in two soil types (basalt-derived, limestone-derived) with two levels of soil moisture thigh, low) and were subjected to three levels of budworm defoliation (none, moderate, heavy) and two levels of frass and litter produced by budworm feeding (with, without) over 2 yr in a greenhouse environment. Defoliation, soil moisture, and soil type influenced allocation of seedling biomass to leaves, stems, and roots. The addition of frass and litter had no effect on any measured soil or tree characteristic. Interactions between defoliation and other experimental factors were not important except for the defoliation x soil moisture interaction where heavy defoliation reduced the negative effects of low soil moisture on seedling predawn water potential, net photosynthetic rate, and stomatal conductance. Heavily defoliated seedlings had less biomass, higher foliar concentrations of N, Ca, and Mg, less ectomycorrhizae, and higher net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance compared with nondefoliated seedlings.

AB  - We examined whether the exposure of Quercus robur L. to elevated UV-B radiation (280-315 nm) during growth would influence leaf decomposition rate through effects on litter quality. Saplings were exposed for eight months at an outdoor facility in the UK to a 30\% elevation above the ambient level of erythemally weighted UV-B radiation under UV-B treatment arrays of fluorescent lamps filtered with cellulose diacetate, which transmitted both UV-B and UV-A (315-400 nm) radiation. Saplings were exposed to elevated UV-A alone under control arrays of lamps filtered with polyester and to ambient radiation under unenergised arrays of lamps. Abscised leaves from saplings were enclosed in 1 mm(2) mesh nylon bags, placed in a Quercus-Fraxinus woodland and were sampled at 0.11, 0.53,1.10 and 1.33 years for dry weight loss, chemical composition and saprotrophic fungal colonization. At abscission, litters from UV-A control arrays had approximate to 7.5\% higher lignin/nitrogen ratios than those from UV-B treatment and ambient arrays (P < 0.06). Dry weight loss of leaves treated with elevated UV-B radiation during growth was 2.5\% and 5\% greater than that of leaves from UV-A control arrays at 0.53 and 1.33 years, respectively. Litter samples from UV-B treatment arrays lost more nitrogen and phosphorus than samples from ambient arrays and more carbon than samples from UV-A control arrays. The annual fractional weight loss of litter from UV-B treatment arrays was 8\% and 6\% greater than that of litter from UV-A control and ambient arrays, respectively. Regression analyses indicated that the increased decomposition rate of UV-B treated litters was associated with enhanced colonization of leaves by basidiomycete fungi, the most active members of the soil fungal community, and that the frequency of these fungi was negatively associated with the initial lignin/nitrogen ratio of leaves.

AB  - The spatial structure of the organic layer fungal biomass estimated from soil ergosterol content of a 1 ha plot in a mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest was described from 181 samples and examined in relation to the organic layer properties (thickness, pH, total C, N, K, Mg and Ca) and two above-ground environmental factors: gap fraction, i.e. proportion of sky not shaded by trees directly above the sampling point and throughfall. Ergosterol content of the organic layer had a clear spatial dependence over the studied area, and the spatially structured autocorrelation variance accounted for up to 90\% of total sample variance in a 4 m range. Most of the measured properties of the organic layer and the above ground environmental factors were also spatially dependent, although to varying degrees. The spatial pattern of ergosterol was most strongly related to pH, organic layer thickness and total C content. Our analyses did not show any direct influence of gap fraction and throughfall on ergosterol. However, gap fraction and throughfall were related to organic layer thickness indicating the importance of the associated factors (moisture, light, temperature, quality of litter) on forest litter decomposition.

AB  - Understanding rhizosphere processes in relation to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations is important for predicting the response of forest ecosystems to environmental changes, because rhizosphere processes are intimately linked with nutrient cycling and soil organic matter decomposition, both of which feedback to tree growth and soil carbon storage. Plants grown in elevated CO2 substantially increase C input to the rhizosphere. Although it is known that elevated CO2 enhances rhizosphere respiration more than it enhances root biomass, the fate and function of this extra carbon input to the rhizosphere in response to elevated CO2 are not clear. Depending on specific plant and soil conditions, the increased carbon input to the rhizosphere can result in an increase, a decrease, or no effect on soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient mineralization. Three mechanisms may account for these inconsistent results: (1) the ``preferential substrate utilization{''} hypothesis; (2) the ``priming effect{''} hypothesis; and (3) the ``competition{''} hypothesis, i.e., competition for mineral nutrients between plants and soil microorganisms. A microbial growth model is developed that quantitatively links the increased rhizosphere input in response to elevated CO2 with soil organic matter decomposition. The model incorporates the three proposed mechanisms, and simulates the complexity of the rhizosphere processes. The model also illustrates mechanistically the interactions among nitrogen availability, substrate quality, and microbial dynamics when the system is exposed to elevated CO2.

AB  - Larix kaempferi seedlings, in the process of becoming established during the revegetation process following a volcanic eruption, were assessed far the types, occurrence patterns and diversity of their ectomycorrhizas along an elevation gradient. On the basis of macro- and microscopic characteristics, 12 types of ectomycorrhizas were classified. In general, ectomycorrhizal types differed more by site than by seedling age. The majority of root systems of seedlings with an age ranging from 1 to 5 years were colonized by I or 2 types of mycorrhizal fungi at low and intermediate elevations, 2 or 3 types at a higher elevation. Under the more stressed environments of high and intermediate elevations, the mean D.W, of I yr old seedlings, 40\% of which were colonized by 3 or 4 mycorrhizal fungi, was double the weight of the same aged seedlings at lower elevation sites, only 10\% of which were colonized by 3 or 4 mycorrhizal fungi. The correspondence between the type and frequency of mycorrhizas, the elevation gradient and litter accumulation suggests that change in litter accumulation along gradient may influence not only mycorrhizal types and their occurrence, but also the diversity of mycorrhizas on one seedling. Diversity of mycorrhizas on the same seedling is assumed to be critical for the establishment of seedlings from the very beginning on stressed sites, and may also be influenced by the availability of nutrients. The more intensive competition between mycorrhizas that occurs due to a reduction in the food source (tip roots) shared by the mycorrhizal fungi with similar resource requirements, results in frequent co-occurrence of mycorrhizas in the same root system or even the same root tip. As a result, the diversity of mycorrhizal types seems to become simplified as the seedlings age.

AB  - This paper is a review of recent experiments dealing with the role of soil fauna in decomposition, mineralisation and primary production in coniferous forest soils. The experiments have been grouped according to the degree and nature of the `diversity gradient' between the `more diverse' community and its control: single animal species or an uncontrolled mixture of species versus microbiota only, several known animal species of the same trophic group versus one species only (species diversity), two or more functional groups versus one only, and food chains with predators versus microbes and microbivores only. The evidence available at present suggests that taxonomic diversity and predation have no consistent effects on the process rates in soil, while adding to the `functional' or `trophic group diversity' results in a more predictable enhancement in mineralisation. Especially the enchytraeid Cognettia sphagnetorum seems to be a keystone species in boreal forest soils. However, there are only few experiments in which species diversity per se has been taken as a separate factor, without a simultaneous change in the number of trophic groups or in total decomposer biomass.

AB  - Arthropod density and species richness were determined using high-gradient extraction for soil on clearcut and late successional forests on the Olympic Peninsula, WA. Study objectives were to compare the effects of harvesting at different soil depths and distances from coarse woody debris. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to determine the effects of soil moisture, CO, evolution, and O and A horizon depth on species composition. Soil depth had a greater effect on changes in density than did distance to woody debris. Densities of Acari, as well as total species richness, were significantly higher at 0-5 cm depths than at 5-10 cm despite significantly lower moisture content at the soil surface. Density of Acari and Coleoptera and species richness were significantly higher on forested sites than on clearcuts. There was a trend toward higher Collembolan density on clearcuts, but the difference was not significant because of the very different responses on dry and wet clearcuts sites. The results of CCA suggests moisture and O and A horizon depths were the most important quantitative environmental factors we measured in determining differences in species composition. Clearcutting appeared to have site specific-effects on wet and dry site locations. Low moisture and temperature extremes did not appear to limit microarthropod density. High rainfall accentuated by clearcutting was associated with lower O and A horizon depths and appeared to decrease Collembola and Coleoptera density on the wet clearcut.

AB  - The term `biodiversity' is claimed to lack connections to a serious scientific background. In this work, we approached the concept of biodiversity from a functional point of view by asking: ``At what level of the ecological organization (species, trophic species/feeding guilds, trophic levels etc.) should reduction in biodiversity matter to bring about visible changes in ecosystem performance?{''} We investigate the concepts of `functional diversity' and `ecosystem performance' in relation to feeding habits (such as fungivory, detritivory etc.) of soil fauna and plant growth. After analysing the results of a number of microcosm studies, we came into the following conclusions: (i) trophic level diversity has clear impacts on primary production - more so when the number of trophic levels is low; (ii) manipulation of large predators at the top of the food chain had no influence on plant growth, whereas smaller mesostigmatid predators generally showed a negative impact on plant growth and nutrient uptake; (iii) declining species diversity alters carbon mineralization in heterotrophic systems due to changing interactions between trophic levels; (iv) species composition within a functional group can affect biomass production of plants; (v) inclusion of ectomycorrhizal fungi in model ecosystems may be of fundamental importance to understanding the most significant interactions between primary producers and organisms in detrital food webs.

AB  - Fungal sporocarps were sampled on 47 logs in six 0.1-ha plots in an old-growth Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) - western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) forest in the Hoh River Valley, Olympic National Park, Washington, from October 1993 to May 1994. Log biomass averaged 205 Mg/ha and the surface area of plots occupied by logs was 9.8\%. Most fungal fruiting occurred on decay class 3 logs, the most common type on a scale from 1 (least decayed) to 5 (most decayed). Eighty-two taxa of fleshy fungi (63 saprophytic, Is mycorrhizal, and one pathogenic) and six taxa of large annual or perennial fungi occurred on logs. Most fungi were basidiomycetes. Highest fleshy sporocarp production occurred in fall (456 g/ha) rather than spring (40 g/ha). Ischnoderma resinosum had the highest annual production (88 g/ha). Concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Na, Fe, Zn, Al, B, and Cu in fruiting bodies were determined. Lower N concentrations occurred in perennial fungi (0.45\%) than mycorrhizal(4.33\%) and fleshy saprophytic species (3.30\%). Only a small fraction of the nutrient capital in the logs was exported to the forest floor in fungal sporophores.

AB  - The abundance and micro-stratification of bacteria and fungi inhabiting the organic layers of a Scots pine forest (Pinus sylvestris L.) were investigated. An experiment using stratified litterbags, containing organic material of four degradation stages (fresh litter, litter, fragmented litter and humus) was performed over a period of 2.5 years. Dynamics and stratification of fluorescent stained bacteria and fungi, ratios between bacterial and fungal biomass, and relationships with moisture and temperature are described. Average bacterial counts in litter and fragmented litter were similar, i.e., approximately 5 x 10(9) bacteria g(-1) (dry weight) organic matter, and significantly exceeded those in humus. The mean bacterial biomass ranged from 0.338 to 0.252 mg carbon (C) g(-1) (dry weight) organic matter. Lengths of mycelia were significantly below the usually recorded amounts for comparable temperate coniferous forests. The highest average hyphal length, 53 m g(-1) (dry weight) organic matter, was recorded in litter and decreased significantly with depth. The corresponding mean fungal biomass ranged from 0.050 to 0.009 mg C g(-1) (dry weight). The abundance of bacteria and fungi was influenced by water content, that of fungi also by temperature. A litterbag series with freshly fallen Litter of standard quality, renewed bimonthly, revealed a clear seasonal pattern with microbial biomass peaks in winter. The mean hyphal length was 104 m g(-1) (dry weight) and mean number of bacteria, 2.40 x 10(9) bacteria g(-1) (dry weight). Comparable bacterial and fungal biomass C were found in the freshly fallen litter {[}0.154 and 0.132 mg C g(-1) (dry weight) organic material, respectively]. The ratio of bacterial-to-fungal biomass C increased from 1.2 in fresh litter to 28.0 in humus. The results indicate the existence of an environmental stress factor affecting the abundance of fungi in the second phase of decomposition. High atmospheric nitrogen deposition is discussed as a prime factor to explain low fungal biomass and the relatively short lengths of fungal hyphae in some of the forest soil layers under study.

AB  - The ectomycorrhizal community associated with regenerating lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Loud.) after clear-cutting in southwestern Alberta was investigated in 6-, 10-, and 19-year-old cut blocks and their adjacent 90-year-old undisturbed control stands. Twenty different mycorrhizal taxa were found in the 90-year-old undisturbed stands. Of these 20, 13 mycorrhizal taxa were found in the 6-year-old cut blocks, and 15 mycorrhizal taxa were found in both the 10- and 19-year-old cut blocks. The most common associate of all stand ages was Mycelium radicis atrovirens Melin (MRA), which overall colonized 29\% (weighted average) of the root tips. Species or groups accounting for greater than 10\% of the mycorrhizas in one or more age classes included Piloderma fallax (Karst.) Jul. (15\% overall), Piloderma byssinum (Karst.) Jul. (11\%), Cenococcum geophihlum L. (8\%), Russuln-like (8\%), Suillus brevipes (Pk.) Kuntze (5\%), Suillus tomentosus (Kauff.) Sing., Snell \& Dick (5\%), and Lactarius delicious (L.:Fr.) S.F. Gray (2\%). Although several mycorrhizal fungi exhibited significant differences in percent relative abundance of root tips colonized, when comparing cut blocks to their controls, there was no evidence to suggest that the suite of mycorrhizal fungi colonizing roots of young lodgepole pine trees was replaced by a different suite of mycorrhizal fungi in mature stands. Extensive fruit body collections, totalling 43 species of ectomycorrhizal fungi, throughout the study sites support this contention.

AB  - Phenolic compounds have been identified previously as potentially responsible for allelopathic interferences in spruce forest at high altitude. They have now been analyzed in canopy leachates, snow, and soil solutions collected from the three layers of the podsolic soil: OA, E, and B. Leachates were characterized by high tanning capacity and by p-hydroxyacetophenone (found at 10(-6) M) also detected as the major (10(-7) M) monomeric compound in snow. At least 10 phenolic monomers, including vanillic, p-hydroxybenzoic, and protocatechuic acids were identified in capillary waters extracted from the OA layer with their sum reaching 2 x 10(-6) M. These monomers were only a small part (1\%) of the total phenolics. In soil solutions, significant decreases in phenolic concentrations with depth were observed between the E and B layers, with qualitative modifications of the phenolic pattern. Spruce leachates and soil solutions exhibited high temporal variability, resulting in transitory allelopathic potential towards both aerial and subterranean parts of spruce seedlings. The occurrence of various and soluble phenolic compounds in the whole forest system, including p-hydroxyacetophenone, which persist from green needles to soil solutions, suggests that they could be involved in complex and interactive processes occurring during organic matter accumulation on the coniferous forest floor.

AB  - Two species of boreal tree seedlings, paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), and the ericaceous shrub Kalmia angustifolia L. were grown in pots with humus from a birch-dominated site and two spruce-Kalmia sites. Root systems interacted with humus form in controlling soil-N cycling as well as energy and nutritional deficiencies of soil microorganisms. In general, Kalmia seedlings affected microbial dynamics and N cycling differently than birch and spruce seedlings did. Birch and spruce seedlings reduced gross N mineralization and immobilization rates, soil mineral-N pools and the amounts of NH4+-N accreted on buried cation exchange resins in all three soils. Compared to birch and spruce seedlings, the growth of Kalmia resulted in significantly higher gross N mineralization rates, soil mineral-N pools and resin-NH4+ accretion in soil from the fertile birch site. Gross N immobilization rates in all soils were generally higher with Kalmia than with spruce or birch seedlings. All three species of seedlings acquired N from the birch site soil, whereas only Kalmia seedlings acquired N from the two spruce-Kalmia site soils. Relative to control treatments, the amount of N mineralized anaerobically increased in the birch-site soil and decreased in the poor spruce-Kalmia site soil with all three species of seedlings. All seedlings increased the microbial biomass in the birch-site soil. Kalmia humus and Kalmia root systems increased microbial energy-deficiency and decreased microbial nutritional deficiency compared to the other humus and seedlings used. Results are discussed in terms of each species' nutrient acquisition mechanism and its competitive ability during secondary succession.

AB  - The effect on ectomycorrhizal root growth in a nitrogen-enriched planted stand of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on podzolic sandy soil to manipulation of litter and humus layers (removal, doubling and control treatments) was examined, and compared to ectomycorrhizal root growth in an untreated naturally established Scots pine stand on nutrient-poor non-podzolic sandy soil. Half a year after manipulation of litter and humus layers in the planted stand, ingrowth-cores to a depth of 60 cm were installed in both stands. Scots pine roots were sampled four times during two growing seasons. Ectomycorrhizal roots were found at all sampled soil depths to 60 cm in all plots. Root growth and ectomycorrhizal development were greater in the naturally established stand than in all plots in the planted stand. Numbers of ectomycorrhizal root tips in the litter and humus removal plots were generally higher than in the control plots in the planted stand until May 1992. Doubling litter and humus did not significantly affect root length or the numbers of ectomycorrhizal root tips. The N-dissolved, NH4+ and NO3- concentrations and the organic matter content in the upper 5 cm of the mineral soil in the planted stand on podzolic sandy soil were generally higher and the pH significantly lower than in the naturally established stand on non-podzolic sandy soil. Root growth and ectomycorrhizal development in the secondary stand may have been negatively affected by the chemical composition of the podzolic sandy soil.

AB  - This study investigated simultaneous plant and soil feedbacks on growth enhancement with elevated {[}CO2] within microcosms of yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) in the second year of growth. Understanding the integrated responses of model ecosystems may provide key insight into the potential net nutrient feedbacks on {[}CO2] growth enhancements in temperate forests. We measured the net biomass production, C:N ratios, root architecture, and mycorrhizal responses of yellow birch, in situ rates gross nitrogen mineralization and the partitioning of available NH4+ between yellow birch and soil microbes. Elevated atmospheric {[}CO2] resulted in significant alterations in the cycling of N within the microcosms. Plant C/N ratios were significantly increased, gross mineralization and NH4+ consumption rates were decreased, and relative microbial uptake of NH4+ was increased, representing a suite of N cycling negative feedbacks on N availability. However, increased C/N ratios may also be a mechanism which allows plants to maintain higher growth with a constant or reduced N supply. Total plant N content was increased with elevated {[}CO2], suggesting that yellow birch had successfully increased their ability to acquire nutrients during the first year of growth. However, plant uptake rates of NH4+ had decreased in the second year. This discrepancy implies that, in this study, nitrogen uptake skewed a trend through ontogeny of decreasing enhancement under elevated {[}CO2]. The reduced N mineralization and relatively increased N immobilization are a potential feedback which may drive this ontogenetic trend. This study has demonstrated the importance of using an integrated approach to exploring potential nutrient-cycling feedbacks in elevated {[}CO2].

AB  - In a soil survey, nematophagous fungi were recovered less from agar plates sprinkled with forest soil (Quercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia) than from those incubated with agricultural (Citrus orchards) soil. Nematodes were present in all soils. The organic matter was higher in forest soils. Water extracts from forest soils with high levels of phenols, leaf litter and Q. rotundifolia fresh leaves affected the development and growth of common species of nematophagous and entomopathogenic fungi. These results show that phenolics from leaf letter could play an important role in the ecology and biology of these invertebrate pathogens in soil.

AB  - This study examined select, naturally-occurring tree mycorrhizae for differences related to efficiency of organic phosphorus hydrolysis in forest soils. We investigated the activity of several phosphatases and root respiration in field-collected ectomycorrhizae of American beech and gray birch and VAM of red maple. Root materials were collected in the early and late growing season from a common soil type. American beech occurred in a late-successional stand, whereas gray birch and red maple grew in a mid-successional stand. All of the root types examined had phosphatase activities with p-nitrophenyl phosphate, bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate and phytic acid and thus the potential to mineralize monoester and diester forms of organic phosphorus. Rates of hydrolysis at pH 5.0 were greatest with p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Although enzyme activity varied with season and ectomycorrhizal morphotype, VAM roots of red maple consistently had the lowest enzyme activities on a length and dry weight basis. Comparison of P-32 uptake from inositol phosphate by gray birch and red maple roots suggested that phosphomonoesterase activity was linked to P uptake from this source. Differences between species in oxygen consumption rates were less pronounced than those observed for enzymatic activities, suggesting similar short-term energy demands by the root types examined. The quantitative differences observed between plants growing on a common soil potentially relate to differences in host demand or reflect differences in basic morphology and/or physiology of associated mycobionts. Further study is necessary to understand the importance of these enzymes in the functional ecology of mycorrhizal fungi.

AB  - A sound understanding of nutrient dynamics in ecosystems is required in order to manage these systems on a sustainable basis. A valuable approach to studying phosphorus (P) dynamics in soil-plant systems has been the use of P isotope techniques. Isotope techniques used for studying P cycling in agricultural and forest soils are reviewed in this paper with particular reference to advances made in the past 15 years. A brief discussion of the properties of P isotopes and their measurements is included together with techniques for measuring exchangeable P in the soil, dissolution and decomposition rates of inorganic and organic P sources applied to the soil, rates of organic P immobilization and mineralization, rates of P release and retention in the soil, root activity and litter decomposition rates in forest soils, and gene probing and hybridization. Basic principles, assumptions, procedures, limitations and merits of methods are discussed. These techniques have served as or have the potential to be valuable tools for advancing our understanding of P dynamics in soil-plant systems, and for studying the molecular characteristics of microbial communities in relation to the cycling of nutrients in the soil.

AB  - In the vegetation periods of 1994 and 1995, fungus-colonized soil samples from around the base of fruit bodies of basidiomycete fungi were excised. They were collected from fairy rings on grass-and woodlands and from stands of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Control samples devoid of conspicuous mycelia originated from adjacent plots with a comparable vegetation and soil structure. Water extraction and spectrophotometric analysis of fungus-colonized samples indicated the presence of several cell-free polyphenol oxidases, peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, hydroxylases, aromatic-ring cleavage dioxygenases, and esterases as well as active oxygen species. Tests for ligninolytic activity were in part positive. The activities of enzymes involved in the catalysis of H2O2, the essential co-substrate of ligninolytic peroxidases, were also detected. Unvegetated control soils contained occasional traces of free polyphenol oxidases and peroxidases. Vegetated control samples were dominated by the activity of guaiacol peroxidase, which is known to be linked with plant tissue. It is concluded that basidiomycetous mycelia grown in the field are associated with the activities of enzymes which directly catalyze the degradation of lignin, some humic material in soil, and aromatic xenobiotics by hydroxylation, oxidation, and cleavage of aromatic ring structures. Further enzymes detected by their activities may be indirectly involved in these degradation processes by forming highly reactive substrate radicals, active oxygen species, and higher-valency metal ions with considerable oxidative capacity.

AB  - The aim this work was to study the influence of the colonies of agaricoid basidiomycetes (AB) on the soil-inhabiting micromycetes and bacteria, developing in the area of active growing mycelia of AB and in the absence latter(control). Objects of studies were 39 dominated and subdominated in Moscou region species AB. For all studied species of AB independing of their taxonomic position and belonging to one or another ecologo-trophical groups, it was possible to note some general regularities: 1) significant increasing of bacterial numbers in hyphosphaere of AB, which was observe in 30 from 39 (76.92 \%) explored species of AB (76.9 \% symbiotrophs, 66 \% - litter saprotrophs, 66 \% - humus saprotrophs). 2) Most part of studied species of AB (13 from 23; 57.5 \%) caused reduction of the number propagules of actinomycetes within colonies of AB in 1.4-10 once. 3) Reduction in 2-125 once number propagules of soil micromycetes in colonies of AB, discovered beside 30 from 39 studied species of AB. The most wide-spread type of influences of colonies of AB on myco-and microbiota inhabiting in the forest soils and litter was a suppression an micromycetes under the simultaneous stimulation the number of bacteria (56.41 \% of studied species AB). On the second place were events of stimulation of bacteria and absence any influences upon micromycetes and simultaneous suppression of both these groups (12.86 \% of studied species of AB for each named ewent). On the third place (7.69 \% species of AB) were events simultaneous stimulation of named groups df soil biota. The rest types of influences of colonies of AB on soil biota formed a small number of events in the procentage attitude.

AB  - The structural complexity and spatial heterogeneity of soils make the direct measurement of biomass a tedious task. These difficulties have led to the development of indirect assays based on biochemical indicators. We have investigated the potential of beta-sitosterol, a component of plant membranes, as an indicator of phytomass in soils. beta-sitosterol was extracted from soil, root and litter samples with hot methanol, following the procedure used for fungal ergosterol, and quantified by HPLC. Concentrations in fine roots (<2 mm dial of 16 herbaceous and woody plants ranged from 0.2 to 2.0 mu g mg(-1) organic mass (mean = 1.0, SD = 0.5). Concentrations in 2 cm dia x 15 cm deep soil cores collected under old field, deciduous hardwood and pine canopies ranged from 2.4 to 26.5 mu g g(-1) soil dry mass, equivalent to fine-root standing crops of 5-60 Mg ha. Microcosm studies indicated that in the early stages of decomposition beta-sitosterol degrades at about the same rate as bulk litter. The beta-sitosterol assay may facilitate the analysis of mycorrhizal associations and the quantification of total fine-root mass. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The horizons of forest and heathland soils in which mycorrhizal roots proliferate typically contain large quantities of polyphenolic materials. These have the potential to bind organic nitrogen in recalcitrant complexes, thereby influencing availability of N to the fungal symbionts. The protein-binding abilities of aqueous extracts of forest soils were examined. and those derived from birch and pine sites were found to bind protein even when present in low concentrations. The effect of polyphenols upon availability of protein to ectomycorrhizal (ECM), ericoid mycorrhizal and wood-decomposing saprophytic fungi was investigated using the soluble polyphenol tannic acid (TA), and protein bovine serum albumin (BSA). While the saprophytic fungi were able to mobilize the precipitate, only three of 18 ECM fungi tested were able to do so. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi were capable of partial clearance of the precipitate. It was demonstrated that the ericoid mycorrhizal fungi had access to N contained in protein complexed by TA, while ECM fungi did not. The extracellular proteases of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi remained active in the presence of TA, while those of the ECM fungi were inhibited. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and several ECM fungi showed abilities to metabolise TA contained in TA-BSA precipitate. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - A method with the combined advantages of soil particle washing, selective inhibitors, and an indicator substrate was developed to isolate saprophytic basidiomycetes from soil. Organic particles were washed from soil and plated on a medium containing lignin, guaiacol, and benomyl, which reduced mold growth and allowed detection of basidiomycetes producing laccase or peroxidase. The 64 soil samples yielded 67 basidiomycete isolates, representing 51 groups on the basis of morphology and physiology, This method should facilitate investigations into the biodiversity of soil basidiomycetes and yield organisms that are useful in bioremediation of soils contaminated with pesticides or other recalcitrant aromatic compounds.

AB  - Respiration of four decomposer fungi (Mycena galopus (Pers.) Kummer, Aureobasidium pullulans (de Bary) Arnaud, Phoma exigua Desm. and Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fres.) de Vries) growing on four species of leaf litter (Pinus sylvestris L., Picea sitchensis (Bongard) Carriere, Fraxinus excelsior L. and Corylus avellana L.) was inhibited by dry-deposited SO2 in a laboratory experiment. Mycelial extension of the four fungi growing on four different agar media was inhibited by SO2 fumigation (40 nl l(-1)) in the laboratory, and media containing carbohydrates decreased the inhibitory effect of SO2 fumigation. Fumigation caused a statistically significant reduction in the mycelial extension of all species tested on tap-water agar. These experiments demonstrate that decomposition of leaf litter is inhibited by environmentally realistic concentrations of SO2 and that the effect is exerted via inhibition of saprotrophic fungi.

AB  - Coarse woody debris (CWD) and soil respiration rates were measured using soda lime traps on a clearcut site in the Hoh River Valley on the west side of the Olympic Peninsula, Washington. The influence of species of CWD (western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France)), decay class, and log diameter on respiration rates was determined. CWD and soil respiration were measured every 4 weeks from October 1991 to November 1992 along with CWD and soil temperature and moisture contents. Western hemlock logs respired at a significantly higher rate (4.05 g CO(2)m(-2). day(-1)) than Douglas-fir logs (2.94 g CO(2)m(-2). day(-1)). There were no significant differences between respiration rates for decay classes 1-2, 3, and 5 logs (4.47, 3.69, and 4.28 g CO(2)m(-2). day(-1), respectively), and there was no strong relationship between CWD respiration rate and log diameter. The highest average respiration rate was from the soil in the clearcut (5.22 g CO2 . m(-2). day(-1)). Averaged for the year, log and soil respiration rates in the clearcut site were similar to those in an adjacent old-growth forested site. However, seasonal fluctuations were greater on the clearcut site. Higher summer respiration rates and lower winter rates observed on the clearcut relative to the old-growth site appeared to be driven more by temperature than by moisture. Clear-cutting also resulted in higher summer CWD and soil temperatures and lower winter temperatures compared with the old-growth site.

AB  - The growth rate of Eucalyptus regnans seedlings in their first year can be much increased if the soil is first dried and then rewetted. The ratio of growth on predried soil to growth on undried soil (the Growth Ratio or GR) reaches a maximum at air-dryness (pF 6.0 - 6.4). In E. regnans forest soil, GR is greatest in humus-rich topsoil and declines with depth. The effect of air-drying persists for several months after rewetting when soil is stored under glasshouse conditions. It is largely unaffected by repeated drying and wetting, by the rate of drying or by the season of collection. The mixing of dried and undried soil or the placement of a layer of dried soil above undried soil produces an enhancement of growth proportional to the amount of dried soil added. Firing of a litter layer above soil at wilting point increases subsequent seedling growth to that in air-dried soil. The addition of ash from a litter fire to undried soil produces an increase in growth approximately equal to that caused by air-drying The drying effect is most pronounced in soils from mature E. regnans forest and nearby brackenland and is less in dense younger forest, frost-hollow grasslands and old grassy gaps in the mature forest. The effect is restored by the inoculation of E. regnans mycorrhizal roots from both dried and undried soil. The effect varies along an gradient from 500 to 1500 m a.s.l. and is a maximum in the wet E. regnans climatic zone and a minimum in zones or local aspects where forests are normally subject to frequent drying. The stimulatory effect on seedling growth in soils of the E. regnans zone may have an effect on the outcome of competition during regeneration in large gaps. Part of the growth responses previously ascribed to the `ash-bed' effect may be due to the desiccation effect in these soils.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal species composition and sporocarp abundance in two 15 - 20-yr old primary stands of Pinus sylvestris in the central part of the Netherlands was compared with those in two 16- and 27-yr old secondary stands of P. sylvestris in the Northeast of the country. The trees of the primary stands were spontaneously seeded in a drifting sand area. Only thin litter and humus layers were present. The trees of the 16-yr old secondary stand were planted on podzolic sandy soil and those of the 27-yr old stand on non-podzolic sandy soil. In both secondary stands thick litter and humus layers had developed. The litter and humus partly originated from former stands at the same sites and partly from the present stands. In the secondary stands the thick litter and humus layers and herb vegetation were removed ('sod-cutting') in order to simulate the thin litter and humus layers in the primary stands. Control treatments were present. Surveys in 1991, 1992 and 1993 showed that sod-cutting enhanced both abundance and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, species richness and diversity were higher in the primary stands than in the secondary ones, also even in the sod-cut plots. High species richness and diversity were associated with low concentrations of nitrogen and relatively high pH in the litter and humus layers, and in the mineral soil.

AB  - The effects of litter and humus layers on the occurrence of ectomycorrhizal sporocarps in 64 plots in six stands of Pinus sylvestris were studied. In 1990, litter and humus layers and herbaceous vegetation were removed ('sod-cutting') in plots in stands of Pinus sylvestris of different age. Removed litter and humus were added on to existing ectorganic layers ('sod-addition') in plots in young and middle-aged stands. Control plots were present. Surveys carried out in 1993 showed that removal of litter and humus layers enhanced numbers of species and sporocarps of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Chemical analyses showed a reduction of the N-dissolved, NH4+, NO3-, P and K+ concentrations and an increase of pH of ectorganic layers as a result of sod-cutting. The N concentrations of the needle samples from the Scots pine trees in the sod-cut plots were reduced compared to the control plots. Addition of litter and humus layers did not affect numbers of species and sporocarps of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Numbers of species and sporocarps of ectomycorrhizal fungi on Haplic Aerosol soil were higher than on Haplic Podzol soil. The low nutrient concentrations and organic matter content and high pH of the Haplic Arenosol soil were likely favourable for ectomycorrhizal fungi. The ectomycorrhizal species composition was also affected by the age of the Scots pine trees.

AB  - The hypothesis that roots enhance soil-N turnover in humified soil organic matter (SOM) (mull) but not in lignified SOM (mor) was tested in a study involving the growth of eight species of tree seedlings on the two contrasting humus forms. After 12 and 22 weeks of seedling growth, soil-CO2 efflux was measured with (1) growing seedlings, and after 22 weeks, with (2) roots only, shoots excised, and (3) with roots removed and soils amended with different rates of glucose. Indices of C-flux and of soil available-C were derived and compared to plant-N uptake, extractable soil mineral-N, anaerobically mineralized soil-N, N bioavailability to Agrostis grass following harvest of seedlings, and to seedling fine root C-chemistry. Significant soil x species interactions were found for total soil-CO2 efflux, root-dependent CO2, soil available-e and microbial biomass. In all cases, roots were important contributors to C-cycling in the mull soil but not in the mor soil. C was more limiting in the mor than in the mull microbial community. Plant-N uptake and the mineral-N pool was greater in the mor soil, reflecting that soil's higher specific N-supplying capacity (N-mineralized:CO2). Seedlings decreased the mineral-N pool in both soils, but the presence of roots increased N-mineralization in the mull soil and decreased N-mineralization in the mor soil. Significant positive relationships were observed in the mull soil only between soil respiration and plant N uptake at mid-season, and between soil respiration and N-mineralization at late-season. Birch root activity in the mull soil was greater than that of all other seedlings and this observation is discussed with respect to the autecology of birch. Soil respiration correlated with the non-polar extract content but not the lignin:N ratio of fine roots. Results suggest that root-released C in mull SOM is sufficient to relieve energy limitation to soil microbes and allow them to access appreciable amounts of soil-N, whereas ligninolytic activity, which may ultimately control soil-N turnover in mor SOM, is not increased by rhizodeposition.

AB  - Scots pine (Pious sylvestris L.) were selectively seeded in 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1994 in bottom layer vegetation of Pleurozium schreberi (Bird.) Mitt. in a clearcut created in 1989 and in an adjacent undisturbed Scots pine forest of Vaccinium type, in northern Sweden. Seedlings from the 1990 seeding established considerably better on the clearcut than in the forest. In contrast, seeding done in 1991, 1992, and 1994 gave no significant difference in seedling establishment between the two sites. Seedlings that established in the clearcut in 1990 grew significantly larger and had a higher content of macro- and micro-nutrients than those in the forest. For seedlings that established in 1992, biomass and nutrient content of seedlings in the clearcut did not differ from those in the forest. Seedlings established in the clearcut in 1990 increased their nutrient content in relation to seed supply, while seedlings established in the clearcut in 1992 and those in the forest had in general gained less or even lost nutrients (especially P) in relation to seed reserve. These results indicate that Pleurozium schreberi-dominated microsites can constitute a favourable microhabitat for pine regeneration following stand disturbance, although the positive effect quickly diminishes with time after disturbance. The higher establishment and growth of emerging seedlings the Ist year after cutting compared with later established cohorts in the clearcut may be caused by changes in nutrient availability. We propose that environmental stress after cutting temporarily diminishes the effect of the nutrient barrier formed by Pleurozium schreberi, ericoid mycorrhiza, and ericaceous dwarfshrubs. We conclude that successful natural pine regeneration in Pleurozium schreberi-dominated vegetation induced by clear-cutting can be severely time restricted. This is an important consideration when dealing with forestry methods that depend on natural regeneration.

AB  - The effects of live and dead roots on soil fungi were investigated experimentally in a spodosolic soil of the New Jersey Pinelands. Field mesocosm plots were constructed to have a layer of either C- and N-rich organic soil or a vermiculite substitute overlying a layer of sandy mineral soil with a very low organic content. The plots were also supplied with live pitch pine and blueberry roots or dead pitch pine roots in varying quantities based on naturally occurring densities (half, same, and double the ambient quantities). All plots were sampled 1 year after construction (June 1991), and three more times in two subsequent years (November 1991, June 1992, June 1993). In the presence of live roots, fluorescein diacetate-determined (FDA-active) fungal hyphae, total fungal hyphae, and soil moisture decreased significantly in the organic material, while no change was associated with the dead roots. The FDA-active fungal length in the live-root plots ranged from 40 to 165 mg(-1) soil, and from 55 to 335 mg(-1) soil in the dead-root plots. While the total fungal length in live-root plots remained constant over time (similar to 3000 m g(-1) soil), the total fungal length in the dead-root plots increased from an initial value of 3000 to > 4000 m g(-1) soil at the conclusion of the study. Fungal lengths in mineral soil were higher under organic material than under the vermiculite substitute. Soil moisture was higher in the presence of live roots in mineral soils, but this did not increase the fungal abundance. Inputs of dead roots did not alter the fungal abundance. Overall, we demonstrated that live and dead roots had different effects on fungal abundance in soils with contrasting qualities, and in a spodosolic forest soil, roots could have ecosystem effects very different from those in agricultural soils.

AB  - The belowground biota (nematodes, fungal biomass, roots and mycorrhizal development) of a mature Sitka spruce stand under the influence of acid precipitation (equimolar sulphuric acid and ammonium nitrate) was investigated. Sampling took place after 3 years of treatment and 5 months after the end of treatment. Acidification led to a decrease of the soil pH from 5.0 to 4.0 in the upper 2 cm of soil. The active fungal biomass, measured as the ergosterol content of the soil, increased. After the end of the acid treatment pH differences decreased between plots. The active fungal biomass was lower, but the amount of total fungal hyphae was higher at the acid treated plots. Additionally, precipitation of acid mist led to an acceleration of fine root and mycorrhizal development and their senescence. A total of 79 nematode species were found in the plots. Acidification caused a distinct decrease in species number, especially among K-strategists like omnivores and predators. The population density was not altered, but the dominance and abundance structure of the community changed. Acrobeloides nanus, Metateratocephalus crassidens and Aphelenchoides spp. spp. showed a higher frequency at the acidified plots. Others, like Cervidellus serratus, Filenchus spp. or Aporcelaimellus obtusicaudatus, decreased. Among the trophic groups, the occurrence of omnivore and predatory nematodes was affected negatively by acidification. The proportion of fungal feeding nematodes increased under acid precipitation, but the effect did not last after the end of the treatment. This corresponds to the amount of the active fungal biomass measured in the soil, indicating that the composition of the nematode fauna is changing with the presence or absence of their food source.

AB  - We studied the effects of mycorrhizal pitch pine (Pinus rigida) roots on litter decomposition, microbial biomass, nematode abundance and inorganic nutrients in the E horizon material of a spodosolic soil, using held microcosms created in a regenerating pitch pine stand in the New Jersey Pinelands. Pine roots stimulated litter decomposition by 18.7\% by the end of the 29 month study. Both mass loss and N and P release from the litter were always higher in the presence of roots than in their absence. Nutrient concentrations in decomposing litter were similar, however, in the presence and absence of roots, which suggests that the roots present in the with-root treatment did not withdraw nutrients directly from the litter. The soil was slightly drier in the presence of roots, but there was no discernible effect on soil microbial biomass. The effects of roots on soil extractable inorganic nutrients were inconsistent. Roots, however, were consistently associated with higher numbers of soil nematodes. These results suggest that, in soils with low total C and N contents, roots stimulate greater activity of the soil biota, which contribute, in turn, to faster litter decomposition and nutrient release.

AB  - In this paper we present a conceptual model of integrated plant-soil interactions which illustrates the importance of identifying the primary belowground feedbacks, both positive and negative, which can simultaneously affect plant growth responses to elevated CO2. The primary negative feedbacks share the common feature of reducing the amount of nutrients available to plants. These negative feedbacks include increased litter C/N ratios, and therefore reduced mineralization rates, increased immobilization of available nutrients by a larger soil microbial pool, and increased storage of nutrients in plant biomass and detritus due to increases in net primary productivity (NPP). Most of the primary positive feedbacks share the common feature of being plant mediated feedbacks, the only exception being Zak et al.'s hypothesis that increased microbial biomass will be accompanied by increased mineralization rates. Plant nutrient uptake may be increased through alterations in root architecture, physiology, or mycorrhizal symbioses. Further, the increased C/N ratios of plant tissue mean that a given level of NPP can be achieved with a smaller supply of nitrogen. Identification of the net plant-soil feedbacks to enhanced productivity with elevated CO2 are a critical first step for any ecosystem. It is necessary, however, that we first identify how universally applicable the results are from one study or one ecosystem before ecosystem models incorporate this information. The effect of elevated CO2 on plant growth (including NPP, tissue quality, root architecture, mycorrhizal symbioses) can vary greatly for different species and environmental conditions. Therefore it is reasonable to expect that different ecosystems will show different patterns of interacting positive and negative feedbacks within the plant-soil system. This inter-ecosystem variability in the potential for long-term growth responses to rising CO2 levels implies that we need to parameterize mechanistic models of the impact of elevated CO2 on ecosystem productivity using a detailed understanding of each ecosystem of interest.

AB  - 1. Little is known about how exposure to UV-B radiation affects rhizosphere microbes. Rhizosphere organisms are fed primarily by root-derived substrates and fulfil functions such as mineralization, immobilization, decomposition, pathogeneity and improvement of plant nutrition; they form the base of the below-ground food web. 2. In this study, we exposed Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum) seedlings to UV-B radiation in order to determine if UV-B influences the activities of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal fungi, bacteria and microbe-feeding arthropods in the rhizosphere. 3. Below-ground organisms are greatly affected by UV-B radiation. Overall, carbon-flow in the plant soil system was shifted from a mutualistic-closed, mycorrhizal-dominated system to an opportunist-open, saprobe/pathogen-dominated one.

AB  - Distribution and fluxes of copper within Pinus sylvestris stands were studied during 1992 - 1994 along a heavy-metal pollution gradient in south-western Finland. The stands are situated at distances of 0.5, 4 acid 8 km from a copper-nickel smelter that started operating in 1945 at Harjavalta. According to the results, copper concentrations in the soil, in the understorey vegetation and in the trees increased steeply towards the smelter. Almost 50 years' accumulation of heavy metals in the soil has caused direct toxic effects to soil microbes, thus decreasing decomposition and nutrient mineralisation. During the past few years, sulphur and heavy metal emissions ham the copper and nickel smelter have been radically decreased. However, the heavy metals which have been accumulating in the soil for decades continue to affect the vegetation for a long time through soil processes. Consequently, long-term accumulation in the soil has to be taken into account when determining the critical loads of forest ecosystems for heavy metals.

AB  - THE importance of dissolved organic nitrogen in ecosystem nutrient fluxes and plant nutrition is only beginning to be appreciated(1,2). Here we report that the polyphenol concentration of decomposing Pinus muricata litter controls the proportion of nitrogen released in dissolved organic forms relative to mineral forms (NH4+ + NO3-). We have previously shown that concentrations of polyphenols in P. muricata foliage vary along an extreme soil acidity/fertility gradient(3). Apparently this feedback to soil conditions controls the dominant form in which litter nitrogen is mobilized, facilitating nitrogen recovery through pine-mycorrhizal associations, minimizing nitrogen availability to competing organisms, and attenuating nitrogen losses from leaching and denitrification. Polyphenol control of nitrogen dynamics helps explain the convergent evolution of tannin-rich plant communities on highly leached soils.

AB  - Area-based sampling was carried out to investigate the effect of thinning and soil properties on accumulation of forest floor carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands in Denmark. Four thinning intensities (unthinned, and about 83\%, 67\% and 50\% of unthinned basal area) were investigated at three sites in Denmark: a calcareous, relatively nutrient rich soil with a sandy loam/loam texture and two soils with low to intermediate nutritional status and sandy loam and loamy sand textures, respectively. The effect of thinning on accumulated carbon and nitrogen was significant at two of the investigated sites. Accumulated phosphorus was significantly affected by thinning at one of these two sites and at the third site. Accumulated carbon and phosphorus were negatively linearly correlated with thinning intensity. pH tended to be highest and C/N and C/P ratios tended to be lowest in the heaviest thinned plots. It is hypothesized that the differences in accumulation may be due to a more favourable microclimate and substrate for saprophytic organisms in the most heavily thinned plots. However, the differences between sites were greater than differences between thinning intensities. The accumulation of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the forest floors was much higher at the two less fertile sites with loamy sand and sandy loam than at the relatively fertile site with sandy loam/loam. Significant differences in pH and in C/N and C/P ratios at the three sites indicate that the amounts of available nutrients influence the mineralization pattern. In addition, at the site with the greatest forest floor root density, competition for nutrients and moisture between mycorrhiza-infected roots and free-living saprophytic decomposers may be co-responsible for the large amounts of accumulated carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.

AB  - 1. We examined how Acer saccharum Marsh seedlings respond in terms of biomass and mycorrhizal colonization levels to the addition of (1) soil microarthropods and (2) decaying Litter, under microcosm conditions. 2. The addition of fauna was associated with decreased arbuscular (-38\%) and hyphal (-30\%) colonization, and increased vesicular colonization (+112\%), with no effect on plant biomass. 3. The addition of decaying litter was associated with decreased arbuscular colonization (-51\%), increased hyphal (+24\%) and vesicular (+117\%) colonization, and extra-radical hyphal length (+38\%), and decreased shoot (-43\%) and root (-23\%) biomass. 4. However, there was a strong synergistic interaction between decaying litter and soil fauna and the addition of both was associated with enhanced arbuscular colonization (+59\%), vesicular colonization (+85\%) and increased shoot biomass (+32\%), and shoot/root biomass ratio (+25\%). 5. Understanding the dynamics involved in such interactions between soil organisms can have profound implications for soil management practices in agriculture, forestry and areas requiring revegetation.

AB  - Throughfall nitrogen of a 15-year-old Picea abies (L.) Karst. (Norway spruce) stand in the Fichtelgebirge, Germany, was labeled with either N-15- ammonium or N-15-nitrate and uptake of these two tracers was followed during two successive growing seasons (1991 and 1992). N-15-labeling (62 mg N-15 m(-2) under conditions of 1.5 g N m(-2) atmospheric nitrogen deposition) did not increase N concentrations in plant tissues. The N-15 recovery within the entire stand (including soils) was 94\% +/- 6\% of the applied N-15- ammonium tracer and 100\% +/- 6\% of the applied N-15- nitrate tracer during the Ist year of investigation. This decreased to 80\% +/- 24\% and 83\% +/- 20\%, respectively, during the 2nd year. After 11 days, the N-15 tracer was detectable in 1-year-old spruce needles and leaves of understory species. After 1 month, tracer was detectable in needle litter fall. At the end of the first growing season, more than 50\% of the N-15 taken up by spruce was assimilated in needles, and more than 20\% in twigs. The relative distribution of recovered tracer of both N-15-ammonium and N-15-nitrate was similar within the different foliage age classes (recent to ii-year-old) and other compartments of the trees. N-15 enrichment generally decreased with increasing tissue age. Roots accounted for up to 20\% of the recovered N-15 in spruce; no enrichment could be detected in stem wood. Although N-15-ammonium and N-15-nitrate were applied in the same molar quantities ((NH4+)-N-15:(NO3-)-N-15 =1:1), the tracers were diluted differently in the inorganic soil N pools ((NH4+)-N-15/NH4+: (NO3-)-N-15/NO3- = 1:9). Therefore the measured N-15 amounts retained by the vegetation do not represent the actual fluxes of ammonium and nitrate in the soil solution. Use of the molar ammonium-to-nitrate ratio of 9:1 in the soil water extract to estimate N-15 uptake from inorganic N pools resulted in a 2-4 times higher ammonium than nitrate uptake by P. abies.

AB  - Effects of manipulation of litter and humus layers (removal, doubling and control treatments) on the colonization potential of ectomycorrhizal fungi were studied in two secondary stands of Pinus sylvestris (5 and 18 years old) in The Netherlands. Five-month-old, sterile-grown Scots pine seedlings, inoculated with Laccaria bicolor, Paxillus involutus or Rhizopogon luteolus and noninoculated seedlings were used as baits. The seedlings were harvested after one growing season. For comparison, sporocarps of ectomycorrhizal fungi were also investigated. Genus composition on the seedlings was independent of initial inoculum, but determined by both treatment and age of the stands. In both stands, removal of litter and humus layers increased, and addition of organic material decreased the number of ectomycorrhizal types on the seedlings. Not all indigenous genera were observed by either outplanting seedlings or sporocarp surveys.

AB  - This study examines the impacts of woody, N-2-fixing invasive Acacia spp. on the patterns of nutrient cycling in two invaded ecosystems of differing nutrient status in the Cape floristic region. Patterns of soil nutrient mineralization were measured by a field incubation method while the significance of the fixation process in altering nutrient cycling was assessed by the delta(15)N natural abundance technique. The results confirm earlier reports that invasion by woody shrubs results in organic matter and nutrient enrichment of surface soils of both ecosystems. However, patterns of nutrient availability (phosphorus and nitrogen) were not necessarily enhanced. In the more fertile strandveld both phosphorus and nitrogen (significant at P<0.10) showed trends towards enhanced annual mineralization rates upon invasion, while in the low nutrient fynbos system only phosphorus followed this trend. It is unclear whether this differential response is a consequence of plant- or soil-derived feedbacks on the decomposition processes in each system. The delta(15)N values of the soils from the invaded sites of both ecosystems indicated a strong influence of the alien species on the soil nitrogen component. However, as with other studies of natural ecosystems, the contribution of nitrogen from fixation could not be readily quantified with the delta(15)N natural abundance method because of problems in selecting suitable non-N-2-fixing reference plants. A technique of disrupting nodule structure and function, by fumigation with O-2, to Obtain the delta(15)N value of a non-N-2-fixing specimen of the study species was tried and found to overcome some of the problems associated with the lack of suitable reference plants. With this technique it was possible to detect the almost total dependence of A. saligna on N-2-fixation in the fynbos soils with their low nitrogen mineralization rates. In the strandveld ecosystem with much higher soil nitrogen release rates A. cyclops was only partly dependent on fixation (about half) for its nitrogen. The nutrient enrichment of both ecosystems and trends towards enhanced rates of nutrient mineralization could have profound implications on the long-term success of alien invader clearing operations and the restoration of the indigenous flora at these sites.

AB  - Two long-term field trials in South Australia were used to detect and characterise changes in soil biological properties that were a consequence of different agricultural management. The properties examined were total bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes; total pseudomonads; cellulolytic bacteria and fungi; mycorrhizal fungi; plant root pathogens (Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium irregulare); bacterial-feeding protozoa; soil mesofauna (collembola and acari); earthworms; microbial biomass; C and N mineralisation; in situ CO2 respiration; cellulose decomposition; acid soil enzyme activity (peptidase, phosphatase, sulfatase). The sensitivity of these biological properties was assessed to tillage (no-tillage v. conventional cultivation), stubble management (stubble retained v. stubble harvested), crop rotation (continuous wheat v. wheat-sown pasture), and N fertilisation (nil v. 80 kg N/ha applied during the crop phase). Tillage, stubble management, crop relation, and N fertilisation significantly (P<0.01) affected C mineralisation and microbial biomass. Tillage with stubble management significantly affected root pathogenic fungi, protozoa, collembola, earthworms, and cellulose decomposition. Crop rotation affected mycorrhizal fungi, protozoa, and soil peptidase activity, and N fertiliser had a significant effect on mycorrhizal fungi, protozoa, and cellulose decomposition. As these biological properties are responsive to agricultural management, they may have potential as bioindicators. Total bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes, cellulose-decomposing bacteria and fungi, soil phosphatase and sulfatase activity, and N mineralisation were less affected by these treatments and may therefore have limited potential as bioindicators.

AB  - We studied Nitrogen (N) transformations in Pinus sylvestris forest stands in the foothills of the SE Pre-Pyrenees (NE Spain). Plots were selected in two contrasting aspects (two plots per aspect) and N supply rate was measured by the resin-core incubation technique once every three months. N leaching through litter layers (L and F horizons) was evaluated by 5 zero-tension lysimeters in each plot. NH4+-N, NO3--N and soluble organic-N were determined in all solutions. N supply rate showed a clear seasonal pattern. Ammonification and nitrification were segregated in space and in time. While ammonification showed a peak in spring, nitrification was higher in summer. There was evidence suggesting that nitrification occurs mostly in Al horizon. Nitrification rates differed significantly among plots. N supply rate was 12.7-23.5 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1) but it did not differ between aspects or plots. Inorganic-N leached through litter layers was 14-17 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1), and represented a high proportion of N supply rate. Organic-N leached through litter layers (27.8-37.0 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1)) was higher than leached inorganic-N. However, in most cases organic-N did not represent a high proportion of changes in soluble organic-N pools in H and Al horizons (about 240 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1)). This large decrease in soluble organic-N was much greater than the increase in inorganic-N. The possible fate of these large amounts of organic-N is discussed.

AB  - To investigate the effect of tree species and soil properties on organic matter accumulation and associated nutrients, an area-based sampling of the forest floor was carried out in a 28 years old species trial including Norway spruce, Douglas fir, beech, and common oak at two sites, a poor and sandy soil, and a fertile loamy soil. The accumulation of C, N and P in the forest floor was significantly higher at the sandy site than at the loamy site under all species. At the loamy site, oak was characterized by lesser accumulation of C, N and P than the other species. Remarkably, the C/N-ratios showed no substantial differences, whereas the C/P-ratios were significantly higher at the sandy site for all species. pH was significantly lower at the sandy site for all species, and among the species, pH was lower in the conifer forest floors than in the broadleave forest floors. The concentration of ammonium, nitrate and phosphate in the soil solution was much higher at the loamy site under all species showing a stronger microbial activity. It is therefore hypothesized that the differences in accumulation rates were, at least partly, caused by differences in the mineralization regimes. Strong root infiltration in the forest floors at the sandy site compared to almost none at the loamy site, is probably responsible for the differences in mineralization rate due to competition between the organic matter decomposers and the tree-roots/mycorrhiza for nutrients.

AB  - Carbon dioxide evolution rates for downed logs (coarse woody debris) and the forest floor were measured in a temperate, old-growth rain forest in Olympic National Park, Washington, using the soda lime trap method. Measurements were taken every 4 weeks from October 22, 1991, to November 19, 1992. Respiration rates for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), logs were deter mined for decay classes 1-2, 3, and 5 in two diameter classes. Overall, western hemlock logs respired at a rate class 1-2 logs of both species were similar to decay class 5 logs (4.46 and 4.07 g CO2.m(-2).day(-1), respectively), but decay class 3 logs respired at a lower rate (3.23 g CO2.m(-2).day(-1)). Seasonal patterns of respiration rates occurred, particularly for decay class 1 and 2 western hemlock logs where monthly averages ranged from a low of 2.67 g CO2.m(-2).day(-1) in February 1992 to a high of 8.30 g CO2.m(-2).day(-1) in September 1992. Rates for decay class 1-2 western hemlock logs were greater than those from the forest floor, which ranged from 3.42 to 7.13 g CO2.m(-2).day(-1). Respiration rates were depressed in late July and August compared with fall and spring owing to the summer drought characteristic of the Pacific Northwest. Large-diameter western hemlock logs in decay class 1-2 had higher respiration rates than small-diameter logs, whereas large-diameter decay class 3 western hemlock logs had lower respiration rates than small-diameter logs.

AB  - 1 Patterns of fine root biomass, morphology, growth and longevity were examined in the northern hardwood zone of Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest to aid understanding of the role of roots in ecosystem function. 2 Fine root biomass in the mature hardwood forest was 471 g m(-2) for < 2 mm roots in June 1987 and was concentrated in the surface soil, with 43\% in the forest floor horizons. After clearcutting, fine root biomass accumulated rapidly in the regrowing forest, reaching 71\% of that in the mature forest after only four years of recovery. 3 Fine root diameter distributions and specific root length (SRL; length/mass) differed among species. SRL was higher in the forest floor than mineral soil horizons, and decreased with increasing root diameter. 4 Fine root production in the mature forest, measured with in-growth cores, averaged 254 gm(-2) year(-1), but this method probably underestimated production. Rapid disappearance of fine roots was observed for roots growing through in situ screens, and these ephemeral roots are difficult to quantify. 5 The initiation of fine root growth in the forest floor was coincident with leaf expansion in the forest canopy; root growth in the mineral soil began 1-2 weeks later. Root growth was most rapid in early summer (mid-June to early July), and the lifespan of these early season roots averaged about 8-10 months across three years of study. This estimate of longevity was consistent with that obtained from the ratio of fine root biomass to production, after correcting the production value for the observed root disappearance from in situ screens (about 50\% of fine roots disappeared from screens within an annual cycle). These longevity estimates also appeared to be consistent with an analysis of the soil C budget based upon soil and fine root respiration and total root allocation. Fine root production was apparently nearly twice as high as leaf production in this ecosystem. 6 These fine root production and turnover estimates are not consistent with results from previous studies of fine root decomposition, and we suggest that fine root decay has been underestimated because existing methods inhibit the saprotrophic activity of rhizosphere organisms.

AB  - We studied the natural succession of the collembolan fauna during the decomposition of stumps in successional Douglas-fir ecosystems at three sites on southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Each site was represented by four seres, comprising regeneration (3-8 years old), immature (25-45 years old), mature (65-85 years old), and old growth stands (> 200 years old). A total of 216 samples collected during autumn. winter and spring yielded 15601 individuals, comprising 72 species, 40 genera and 12 families. Most of the species encountered (63.8\%) were common to all sites. Densities on a volume basis equaled those in soil. Well-decayed stumps contained about 850000 individuals m-3. This species-rich and numerically abundant collembolan fauna was essentially a subset of the soil fauna. The composition of the collembolan community was more sensitive to the successional status of the forest than to season of sampling or to decay status of the wood. Stumps provided a suitable habitat for most soil Collembola and emphasizes the importance of this woody debris in forest ecosystems. Favourable moisture conditions make this habitat an important refugium for these arthropods during early stages of forest succession. By virtue of the large population in stumps, Collembola likely contribute greatly to the decomposition of this woody material.

AB  - In primary succession following deglaciation at Glacier Bay, Alaska, we tested the hypothesis that the major effect of initial nitrogen-fixing colonizers is to facilitate establishment of late-successional dominants and that other possible causes of successional change (e.g., life history factors governing seed rain and competitive interactions among species) need not be invoked. Environment changed dramatically through the first 200 yr of succession. Soil organic matter increased 10-fold in the upper mineral soil with corresponding increases in soil moisture, total nitrogen (N), and capacity to support plant growth and declines in bulk density, pH, and total phosphorus (P). Plant growth in pioneer soils tended to be simultaneously limited by both N and P, as well as by unknown factors (perhaps lack of mycorrhizae), whereas only P limited growth in older soils. Light availability to seedlings declined through succession. Early-successional species (Epilobium latifolium, Dryas drummondii) had smaller seeds, younger age at first reproduction, shorter life-span, and shorter height at maturity than did mid-successional (alder, Alnus sinuata) and late-successional species (sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis). Seed rain of alder and spruce was negligible in the pioneer stage, increased prior to the stage in which a species was dominant, and was greatest in the stage in which a species dominated. Vegetation in each successional stage inhibited germination and initial establishment of sown alder and spruce seeds (except a tendency of the `'black-crust'' algal/microbial community in the pioneer stage to enhance survivorship). Removal of the surface litter layer generally enhanced germination and survivorship, particularly of alder. Comparisons of germination in the greenhouse and the field indicated that climatic or indirect vegetation effects (e.g., differential seed predation) and allelopathy also reduced germination and establishment in vegetated communities. Naturally occurring spruce seedlings grew most rapidly in the Dryas and alder stages and most slowly in the spruce stage. Similarly, growth of spruce seedlings transplanted into each successional stage was facilitated by the Dryas (nonsignificantly) and alder stages but inhibited by the spruce stage, relative to earlier successional stages. Facilitation of growth of natural and transplanted spruce seedlings by Dryas and alder stages was associated with higher N and P uptake and tissue nutrient concentrations, whereas nutrient uptake and concentration in spruce seedlings declined in the spruce stage. By contrast, transplanted alder seedlings grew rapidly and accumulated most nutrients in the pioneer stage and were strongly inhibited by subsequent stages. The facilitative effect of Dryas and alder comes primarily from inputs of organic matter and associated N. Addition of alder litter stimulated nutrient uptake and growth of transplanted spruce seedlings in the pioneer and Dryas stages, whereas shading had no effect on growth of spruce seedlings. Root trenching and planting of spruce near isolated alders indicated that, although the net effect of alder is facilitative, alder also inhibits growth of spruce seedlings through competition for soil resources. Strong root competition also occurs in the spruce stage. Alder competitively inhibits Dryas, primarily by shading but also through the physical and allelopathic effects of its litter. In general, both at Glacier Bay and elsewhere, life history traits determine the pattern of succession. Changes in competitive balance accompanying successional changes in environment provide the mechanism for changes in species dominance. Initial site conditions (and facilitation, where present) influence the rate of change and final state of community composition and productivity. We conclude that no single factor or mechanism fully accounts for primary succession at Glacier Bay.

AB  - Locations of epigeous basidiocarps of five common ectomycorrhizal fungi with substantial spore deposits beneath them and of two hypogeous species were marked in the fall.  Subsamples of the litter and mineral soil at 0- to 3- and 3- to 6-cm depths were subsequently taken with a soil corer from locations marked for epigeous basidiocarps, and extracted in the fall and again following snowmelt with a procedure developed to enumerate propagules of ectomycorrhizal fungi from the soil.  Spores of most epigeous species were plentiful in the litter layer in the fall but were much less abundant in the spring.  Spores of Suillus brevipes, Suillus tomentosus and Lactarius scrobiculatus were still present at the 0- to 3-cm depth in the spring.  No spores of any of the epigeous fungi were found at the 3- to 6-cm depth in the spring. Subsamples of mineral soil were also taken in the spring at locations marked for the hypogeous fungi.  Spores of both Rhizopogon subcaerulescens and Rhizopogon rubescens were present in high numbers in the lowermost soil fractions after snowmelt.  In a second study sclerotia of two species of fungi were extracted from soil in a burned area and a nearby unburned forest for 2 years following fire.  Sclerotia of Cenococcum geophilum and a species of Morchella were more numerous in the burn than in the unburned forest in both years.  Both basidiospores and sclerotia persisted in the soil for at least 2 years.  Basidiospores of hypogeous fungi appear to persist in the soil for longer periods than those of epigeous fungi due to in situ dispersion deeper into the soil profile.  Although maximum longevity of spores in the soil has not been determined, observed differential persistence of spores from epigeous and hypogeous ectomycorrhizal fungi could play a role in soil mycorrhiza-forming potential and population dynamics of ectomycorrhizal fungi.

AB  - In an attempt to determine how stand age and mat-forming fungi affect N chemistry in forest soils, soils with or without ectomycorrhizal mats were collected from five Douglas-fir {[}Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] forest stands, age 2-450 yr, in the Oregon Cascade Mountains. A number of chemical and biological variables were measured in these soils, including: soil organic matter (SOM), pH, total N, inorganic N, extractable NH4+ and NO3-, fungal hyphal length, numbers of bacteria, and labile C and N. Total soil N and labile N both were significantly greater in old-growth soils than in other soils, suggesting that forest soils become enriched in organic N with age. Labile C concentrations were higher in mat than in non-mat soils of all age classes but were significantly higher only in the older stands. This finding suggests that ectomycorrhizal mat communities affect soil N with age both by selectively removing organic N and by producing compounds with high C:N ratios.

AB  - 1. The seasonally deciduous tree species Bombax ceiba L. and Sterculia quadrifida R. Br. formed 9.1\% and 2.3\%, respectively, of the total basal area in a coastal dry monsoon rainforest in the Australian seasonally dry tropics. Neither species occurred in a nearby Eucalyptus savanna. 2. Both communities occurred on deep, iron-rich, sandy loam soils. The savanna had lower concentrations of nutrients in the surface soil than the rainforest but experienced greater maximum ground surface air temperatures than the monsoon rainforest when averaged over 1 year. Minimum air temperatures were similar. Annual mean surface soil moisture content was similar in savanna and rainforest, but savanna soils were drier in the dry season. During this time both communities had soil matric pressure potentials below 1-3 MPa. 3. S. quadrifida established more successfully in the rainforest than in the savanna but B. ceiba establishment was <2\% in both communities. Nursery experiments also showed that B. ceiba had a consistently lower rate of establishment than S. quadrifida, and that seed establishment of both species was greatest on unsterilized rainforest and savanna soil. Adding 40\% gravel to savanna soil also resulted in improved establishment. Eucalyptus litter, light, and rainforest or savanna soil were found to have no significant effect on seed establishment of either species. 4. After 12 months 70\% of B. ceiba and 40\% of S. quadrifida seedlings survived following transplantation to the rainforest. No transplants survived in the savanna, but transplants of both species survived in an irrigated savanna. Grass fires were not absolutely lethal to both species on an irrigated savanna plot. Soil sterilization inhibited the growth of both species on rainforest soils in pots, but adding fertilizer eliminated the growth inhibition caused by sterilization except when B. ceiba was grown on rainforest soil. Eucalyptus litter, light and different proportions of gravel in the soil had no effect on seedling growth rates of either species. 5. It is concluded that the long-term development of a monsoon-rainforest-savanna ecotone is critical for creating microclimatic and soil conditions favourable for monsoon-rainforest seedling establishment and growth. Experiments point toward the importance of mycorrhizas, soil fertility and soil moisture in controlling monsoon-rainforest seedling establishment. This study helps explain why so few monsoon-rainforest seedlings have been observed to establish in fire-protected Eucalyptus savannas.

AB  - The preservation of biodiversity requires an appreciation of food web structure and an understanding of how disturbance alters their structure,and function. Theoretical and empirical studies of food webs demonstrate that food webs possess a regular structure. Food chain length appears limited to three to four transfers, and, complexity and diversity are constrained. When ecosystem energetics are considered, species within food webs are seen to form interactive assemblages that process matter at different rates and respond to disturbance differently. Disturbance may affect the diversity of a system, or, may influence the relative importance of one species assemblage over another. Moreover, predicting the impact of disturbance on a system is difficult as species that comprise and process a small fraction of the system's biomass may control a disproportionate fraction of the system's biomass and diversity. Seven food webs at four sites were used in a modeling exercise to demonstrate this point. Field studies involving the role of mycorrhizal fungi yielded results consistent with the modeling studies as the types of plant species present, the level of production and the diversity of production were related to the levels of mycorrhizal fungi in the soils following disturbance. The results indicate that all species are important to ecosystem structure and function and that the monitoring of ecosystems and conservation efforts should expand their emphasis to the preservation of ecosystem integrity as well as that of individual species.

AB  - Root biomass was determined for four sites on each of two toposequences in the New Jersey Pinelands. The sites have similar plant species composition, disturbance histories, and soil parent materials; the soils at the different topographic positions vary principally in the thickness of the organic horizon. Each toposequence consisted of lowland, transition, and upland sites, plus a site in the pygmy pine stands found on exposed topographic rises within the region. Root biomass was determined for three depths (organic horizon, 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm mineral soil) and three size classes (<1, 1-5, and >5 mm). Total, fine, and intermediate root biomass was greatest at lowland sites and least at sites in the pygmy pine stands. Total and fine root biomass in both the forest floor and also the upper mineral layer was linearly related to thickness of the organic horizon. The percent allocation of roots among soil layers, and the percentage of roots in different size classes within each soil depth interval, were similar for lowland, transition, and upland sites. The pygmy pine stands, in contrast, had higher relative quantities of total and fine roots in the mineral soil than in the organic horizon. In the organic horizons at all topographic positions, 50-100\% of the roots are fine roots, whereas only 10-20\% of the roots in the mineral layers are fine roots. Although root biomass per unit area varies >2-fold from lowland to pygmy sites, biomass per unit volume of organic material does not vary among topographic positions. Volumes of organic matter are more densely filled with roots than are comparable volumes of mineral soil. Implications for the role of roots in nutrient cycling in different soil horizons are discussed.

AB  - Poor establishment and reduced seedling growth of Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.) in northern Sweden is related to an allelopathic inhibition by the dwarf shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup. Indoor bioassays with green and brown leaves of Empetrum have strong negative effects on rooting ability, radicle elongation, and growth of Scots pine seedlings. Bioassays with soil samples show that phytotoxic substances leached from Empetrum foliage accumulate in the soil. Field experiments reveal that chemical inhibition by Empetrum, causing high mortality and slow growth of pine seedlings, can be reduced by adding activated carbon to the soil.

AB  - Indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrated that allelopathy is an important factor explaining seed regeneration failures of Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.) in forest floor vegetation dominated by the dwarf shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup. Scanning electron micrograph views of the leaf surfaces of E. hermaphroditum reveal secretory glands that are shown to be involved in the release of water-soluble phytotoxic substances. Bioassays indicate that low doses and short exposure times of seeds to leachates have strong negative effects on germination and early root development. Activated carbon can eliminate the inhibitory effects of leachates and litter. This technique demonstrates the occurrence of allelopathic interference by E. hermaphroditum on seed germination of both Scots pine and aspen (Populus tremula L.). In a field experiment the allelopathic effects by E. hermaphroditum are strong during early spring when germination and growth initiate and ground ice still is present. Extracts passed through soils collected from an E. hermaphroditum site were detoxified, while those passed through sterilized soil were not. Therefore, microorganisms may detoxify the allelochemicals under some environmental conditions.

AB  - Comparisons of the saprotrophic fungi isolated from ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), birch (Betula spp.), hazel (Corylus avellana L.), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), sessile oak {[}Q. petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.] and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) leaf litters from three woodlands exposed to low, medium and high levels (c. 0-0- > 0.060 mul 1-1) of sulphur dioxide (SO,) showed that the composition of the fungal communities differed between sites. Fumigation of angiosperm tree leaf litters from the least and the most polluted site with environmentally-realistic concentrations (0.010-0.030 mul l-1) of SO, for 16-68 wk in an open-air field-fumigation experiment resulted in marked changes in the composition of the fungal communities in the leaf litters, comparable with differences found between the woodland sites. Cladosporium spp., Epicoccum nigrum Link, Fusarium spp. and Phoma exigua Desm. were less commonly isolated from leaf litters exposed to SO2, whereas Coniothyrium quercinum Sacc. var. glandicola Grove, Cylindrocarpon orthosporum (Sacc:) Wollenw. and Penicillium spp. were more frequently isolated from fumigated litters. However, few differences could be detected in the response to SO2 of the mycofloras of leaf litters originating from different woodland sites. In general, SO2 did not affect the total extent of fungal occupancy of the microsites in the litter, as fungal species which decreased in abundance on exposure to the gas appeared to be replaced in the litter by other species more tolerant to the gas. SO2 therefore appeared to be selectively toxic to saprotrophic fungi isolated from these litters.

AB  - During micromorphological investigations on Scots pine litter, several decomposition stages have been recognized on fallen pine needles, each being associated with the activity of animal and microbial organisms, both. To well-known fungal successions that have been so far described by mycologists we must add succession of animal groups such as nematodes, amoebae, enchytraeids, sciarid larvae, oribatid mites and earthworms. A bacterial development was observed in the L2 layer, following penetration by microfauna (nematodes, amoebae). After that stage pine needles were actively tunnelled by enchytraeids, sciarid larvae and oribatid mites and at the same time were nibbled on by epigeic earthworms (L2 and F1 layers). When the fine root system of pine developed through accumulated old needles (F1 layer), mycorrhizal fungi penetrated the needles and seemed to impede any further bacterial development. Pine foliar tissues were progressively incorporated into the fecal material of earthworms and other members of the soil fauna. A more realistic scheme was suggested for plant litter decomposition in moder humus.

AB  - The guild and functional group concepts are generally accepted as suitable units in ecosystem modelling, when interspecific relationships and energy or nutrient flows are studied.  It is argued, however, that members of a feeding guild assemblage can have specific effects on ecosystem processes through microstratification, particularly in stratified habitats such as soils.  A new concept, `league', is introduced which follows a guild-like classification, but assembles organisms by their exploitation or processing of more than one habitat resource in a homologous manner.  The concept is illustrated for soil fauna feeding habits and choice of microhabitat, and the classification is discussed in view of soil fauna mediated decomposition and nutrient cycling processes.  Using literature review data, three leagues are hypothesized for soil fungivores.  Epigeic fungus engulfers interact with fungal colonization of fresh leaf litter, with the potential for affecting decomposition rate.  Hemiedaphic fungus engulfers affect net mineralization and nutrient mobilization in fragmented litter. Euedaphic fungus engulfers have the potential to affect plant growth by interference with mycorrhizal establishment or nutrient uptake by the roots.  Detritivorous soil fauna taxa are also discussed.  It is argued that league classification of soil fauna offers a close relationship with individual species impacts on soil processes.  Other fields in system ecology are suggested where league classification may be applied.

AB  - We hypothesized that the grazing of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) hyphae by soil animals could be responsible for the lack of a direct relationship between mycorrhizal infection intensity and nutrient uptake under field conditions. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of a range of densities of the collembola, Folsomia candida, on growth, VAM infection, and P uptake in Geranium robertianum, a common forest herb, under greenhouse conditions. Total and aboveground growth were greater at low collembola density than either at higher collembola density or without collembola. These differences were greater when the plants were grown in a high organic content soil mix than when grown in sand. Root mass was not affected by collembola density. In the soil mix, root length decreased with increasing collembola density, but not in the sand. The percent of root length infected with VAM was lower at any collembola density than when collembola were absent. Total infected root length decreased linearly with increasing collembola density. Few significant differences in P uptake or tissue concentration were found. Thus, plant growth (but not P uptake) may be stimulated at low collembola density and inhibited at high. We discuss mechanisms which may be responsible for this non-linear response, and the implications of the pattern of response to studies of plant competition, nutrient turnover, and revegetation.

AB  - Symbiotic association of roots with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is a very widespread strategy by which plants facilitate their acquisition of mineral elements from the soil. Studies employing sophisticated methodology in the fields of in vitro culture of AM colonized roots, microscopy, isotope labeling and molecular biology have shed light into the physiology of AM fungal nutrient uptake, transport and delivery to the host plant. In addition to the direct contribution to element uptake via the symbiotic pathway, AM mycelia have also been shown to affect root morphology and functioning, as well as mycorrhizosphere soil properties. This may lead to indirect effects of the AM association on plant nutrient availability and uptake. With their thin diameter, AM hyphae might be able to access smaller soil pores, and better compete with soil microbes for nutrient resources, compared with plant roots. Alone or in collaboration with associated hyphosphere bacteria, AM mycelia might also promote chemical mobilization of nutritional elements from sparingly plant available resources. Similar with plant root systems, AM mycelia appear to differ considerably in their architecture and physiological activities depending on their genotype. Whether such inherent traits represent different strategies in nutrient acquisition in collaboration with functionally compatible host roots, still remains speculative. Not much is known about how the AM fungal symbiosis is integrated into particular plant nutrient acquisition strategies, but it can be assumed that individual symbiotic strategies are highly diverse. The AM mycelium might assist the roots in spatial and/or chemical soil nutrient resource exploitation in a complementary and/or synergistic way. Knowledge about what factors determine the extent of functional compatibility between individual plant nutrient acquisition strategies and certain AM fungal traits would contribute to our understanding of ecosystem functioning, and might assist further development of mycorrhiza technology for plant production.
