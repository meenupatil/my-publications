Abstract = {{1. Plant roots and their mycorrhizal symbionts are critical components
   of forest ecosystems, being largely responsible for soil resource
   acquisition by plants and the maintenance of soil structure, as well as
   influencing soil nutrient cycling. Silvicultural treatments should be
   guided by knowledge of how these below-ground components respond to
   different forest management practices.
   2. We examined the cumulative effects of 20 years of prescribed burning
   at 2-year intervals. We measured fine root length density and fine root
   and mycorrhizal root biomass in the upper 15 cm of mineral soil in a
   south-western ponderosa pine forest over a complete burn cycle.
   3. Repeated burning reduced fine root length, fine root biomass and
   mycorrhizal root biomass, as well as the amount of nitrogen and
   phosphorus stored in these below-ground pools.
   4. Estimates of fine root production, fine root decomposition and
   nutrient dynamics were similar in burned and control plots.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Although repeated-prescribed fire may be
   an effective, low-cost approach for reducing fuel loads and lessening
   the chance of a catastrophic wildfire in ponderosa pine forests, our
   results suggest that this strategy may negatively affect below-ground
   biomass pools and nutrient cycling processes in the long term. We
   recommend that mechanical reductions in fuel loads be conducted in these
   and similar forests that have not experienced fire for decades, before
   fire is reintroduced as a management tool.}},

Abstract = {{Plant communities on nutrient-poor soils are thought to use nutrients
   more efficiently to produce biomass than plant communities on
   nutrient-rich soils. Yet, increased efficiency with declining soil
   nutrients has not been demonstrated empirically in lowland tropical rain
   forests, where plant growth is thought to be strongly limited by soil
   nutrients, especially phosphorus (P). We tested for higher P uptake and
   use efficiency across a 16-fold soil P gradient in lowland Borneo by
   measuring the P content of aboveground net primary productivity (fine
   litter production plus new tree growth; ANPP) for 24 months. Extractable
   soil P was positively related to litter production, tree growth, and
   ANPP. Efficiency of P response (ANPP/available soil P), uptake (P
   uptake/available soil P), and use (ANPP/P uptake) increased
   monotonically with declining soil P and was significantly higher on
   P-rich soil than P-poor soil. Increased P uptake and use efficiency with
   declining soil P enabled higher than expected plant productivity on low
   P soils and thus strongly influenced spatial patterns of aboveground
   productivity throughout this lowland landscape.
   A complementary P use efficiency index, the integrated canopy P (P-c)
   use efficiency of production (ANPP/P. X residence time of P-c), was
   similar across the P gradient, but underlying dynamics varied
   significantly with soil P: on rich soils, ANPP/P. was high and Pc
   residence time was low, while the converse held on poor soils. These
   contrasting strategies enabled rapid tree growth on nutrient-rich soils,
   where P limitation is relatively weak, and higher P conservation on
   nutrient-poor soils, where P limitation is relatively strong. The
   occurrence of contrasting P use strategies on high and low P soils has
   important implications for understanding spatial patterns of aboveground
   productivity, P cycling, and canopy tree species composition across the

Abstract = {{We manipulated the number of saprotrophic fungi in either a complex

   richness of microbial decomposers strongly affects decomposition
   processes, at least at the species poor end of the diversity gradient.
   Both, `sampling effect' and `species complementarity effect' contributed
   to the community response with the latter being much more pronounced in

Abstract = {{We determined whether Pinus resinosa, selected ectomycorrhizal and
   saprotrophic microfungi have access to various organic nitrogen sources
   commonly found in the forest. Vector analysis demonstrated nitrogen
   limitation of the P. resinosa in the plantation from which most of the
   fungi were isolated, establishing this study's relevance. Nonmycorrhizal
   P. resinosa seedlings did not absorb significant N from amino acids. The
   ectomycorrhizal fungi, including Pisolithus tinctorius, Suillus
   intermedius and Tylopilus felleus, obtained substantial N from amino
   acids, a limited amount of N from glucosamine, and essentially no N from
   protein-tannin complex. In contrast, Penicillium and Trichoderma readily
   acquired N from protein-tannin and glucosamine. Thus, there was an
   increasing ability to obtain N from complex organic N sources from plant
   to ectomycorrhizal fungi to saprotrophic fungi. Furthermore, N
   mineralization from an organic N source by Penicillium depended on the
   C:N ratio. We conclude that acquisition of relatively simple organic N
   sources by P. resinosa is likely to be largely indirect via
   ectomycorrhizal fungi, and that more complex organic N sources may
   become accessible to ectomycorrhizal fungi (and thus possibly their host
   plants) following mineralization by saprotrophic fungi such as
   Penicillium or Trichoderma when C:N ratios are sufficiently low. (c)

Abstract = {{By assessing current leaf litter nutrient dynamics, we may be able to
   predict responses of nutrient cycling in tropical ecosystems to future
   environmental change. The goal of this study was to assess whether
   nutrient cycling is related to seasonal variation in rainfall in a wet
   tropical forest. We examined leaf litter of an old-growth tropical rain
   forest in N.E. Costa Rica over a 4-year period to explore seasonal and
   inter-annual changes in leaf litter nutrient concentrations, and to
   evaluate potential short- and long-term drivers of variation in litter
   nutrient concentration, particularly that of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen
   (N). We also examined the temporal dynamics of calcium, potassium, and
   magnesium in the leaf litter. Leaf litter {[}P] and \%N changed
   significantly with time, both seasonally and inter-annually. Seasonal
   changes in leaf litter {[}P] were strongly positively correlated with
   rainfall from the previous 2 weeks; cations, however, were inversely
   related to this measure of current rainfall, while \%N was not related
   to rainfall. We propose that the positive relationship between current
   rainfall and leaf litter {[}P] is due to a response by the vegetation to
   an increase in nutrient availability and uptake. In contrast, given the
   negative relationship between current rainfall and cation
   concentrations, leaching from live leaf tissue is a more likely driver
   of short-term changes in cations. Should global climate change include
   altered rainfall patterns in this biome, one class of ecosystem-level
   responses could be significant changes in P and cation cycling.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the role of soil respiration in determining ecosystem
   carbon balance, and the conceptual basis for measuring and modeling soil
   respiration. We developed it to provide background and context for this
   special issue on soil respiration and to synthesize the presentations
   and discussions at the workshop. Soil respiration is the largest
   component of ecosystem respiration. Because autotrophic and
   heterotrophic activity belowground is controlled by substrate
   availability, soil respiration is strongly linked to plant metabolism,
   photosynthesis and litterfall. This link dominates both base rates and
   short-term fluctuations in soil respiration and suggests many roles for
   soil respiration as an indicator of ecosystem metabolism. However, the
   strong links between above and belowground processes complicate using
   soil respiration to understand changes in ecosystem carbon storage. Root
   and associated mycorrhizal respiration produce roughly half of soil
   respiration, with much of the remainder derived from decomposition of
   recently produced root and leaf litter. Changes in the carbon stored in
   the soil generally contribute little to soil respiration, but these
   changes, together with shifts in plant carbon allocation, determine
   ecosystem carbon storage belowground and its exchange with the
   atmosphere. Identifying the small signal from changes in large, slow
   carbon pools in flux dominated by decomposition of recent material and
   autotrophic and mycorrhizal respiration is a significant challenge. A
   mechanistic understanding of the belowground carbon cycle and of the
   response of different components to the environment will aid in
   identifying this signal. Our workshop identified information needs to
   help build that understanding: (1) the mechanisms that control the
   coupling of canopy and belowground processes; (2) the responses of root
   and heterotrophic respiration to environment; (3) plant carbon
   allocation patterns, particularly in different forest developmental
   stages, and in response to treatments (warming, CO2, nitrogen
   additions); and (4) coupling measurements of soil respiration with
   aboveground processes and changes in soil carbon. Multi-factor
   experiments need to be sufficiently long to allow the systems to adjust
   to the treatments. New technologies will be necessary to reduce
   uncertainty in estimates of carbon allocation, soil carbon pool sizes,
   and different responses of roots and microbes to environmental
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In an old growth coniferous forest located in the central Cascade

   respiration. Annual soil efflux from control plots ranged from 727 g C
   m(-2) year(-1) in 2002 to 841 g C m(-2) year(-1) in 2003. We used
   aboveground litter inputs ( 149.6 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and differences in
   soil CO2 effluxes among treatment plots to calculate contributions to
   total soil efflux by roots and associated rhizosphere organisms and by
   heterotrophic decomposition of organic matter derived from aboveground
   and belowground litter. On average, root and rhizospheric respiration
   (R-r) contributed 23\%, aboveground litter decomposition contributed
   19\%, and belowground litter decomposition contributed 58\% to total
   soil CO2 efflux, respectively. These values fall within the range of
   values reported elsewhere, although our estimate of belowground litter
   contribution is higher than many published estimates, which we argue is
   a reflection of the high degree of mycorrhizal association and low
   nutrient status of this ecosystem. Additionally, we found that measured
   fluxes from plots with doubled needle litter led to an additional 186 g
   C m(-2) year(-1) beyond that expected based on the amount of additional
   carbon added; this represents a priming effect of 187\%, or a 34\%
   increase in the total carbon flux from the plots. This finding has
   strong implications for soil C storage, showing that it is inaccurate to
   assume that increases in net primary productivity will translate simply

   Gross NH4+ production rate was the most important determinant of plant

Abstract = {{We examined the impact of soil stress (low water and nutrient
   availabilities) and two keystone insect herbivores on pinyon pine (Pinus
   edulis) needle litterfall. We compared trees growing on two distinct
   soil types: volcanic cinders, which exhibit pronounced water and
   nutrient limitation, and sandy-loam soils, which have higher
   water-storage capacity and nutrient availability. Using two long-term
   herbivore removal experiments (15 and 18 years, respectively), we also
   examined the effects of the pinyon needle scale (Matsucoccus acalyptus,
   which attacks juvenile trees) and the stem-boring moth (Dioryctria
   albovittella, which attacks mature trees) on pinyon litterfall. These
   herbivores reach high densities on cinder soils but are absent or occur
   at much lower levels on sandy-loam soils. Four years of litterfall
   measurements showed four major patterns. First, independent of
   herbivory, needle litterfall was 20\% lower under trees on high-stress
   cinder soils than on sandy-loam soils. Second, in agreement with the
   negative impact of scales on tree growth (that is, a 30\% decline in
   stem growth), trees with scale infestations had 25\% lower litterfall
   rates than trees resistant to scale; however, 15 years of scale-insect
   removal did not significantly increase needle litterfall. This implies
   possible intrinsic differences in litter production between
   scale-resistant and scale-susceptible trees. Third, in contrast with
   significant negative effects of moth herbivory on tree growth (that is,
   a 27\% decline in stem growth), moth herbivory had no effect on needle
   litterfall. This, along with increased stem density in moth-susceptible
   trees, may be evidence of compensatory production. Fourth, there were
   strong year by soil type and year by scale herbivory interactions, such
   that in some years the effect on litterfall can be obscured or reversed
   by some other factor. In summary, soil stress has a strong and
   predictable effect on needle litterfall, whereas the relationship
   between insect herbivory and needle litterfall is weaker and depends on
   the individual herbivore. These effects, however, are mediated by other
   environmental factors that have considerable annual variation.}},

   properties and processes, and biological properties, including the
   community composition of the microbiota and soil fauna. For each
   pathway, we review the mechanistic basis and assess the evidence that
   feedback occurs. We suggest that several properties of feedback systems
   (for example, their complexity, specificity, and strength relative to
   other ecological factors, as well as the temporal and spatial scales
   over which they operate) be considered. We find that the evidence of
   feedback is strongest for plants growing in extreme environments and for
   plant-mutualist or plant-enemy interactions. We conclude with
   recommendations for a more critical appraisal of feedback and for new
   directions of research.}},

   cryptic and ephemeral. Based on a meta-analysis of macrofungal diversity
   studies, we show that tree diversity is a promising surrogate for
   macrofungal diversity at large spatial scales. We present evidence that
   trees species richness can be used to predict macrofungal species
   richness and that on the global scale, the distribution of individual
   tree and macrofungal species notably differs. Additionally our findings
   provide support for the use of ``ratio estimates{''} to estimate fungal

   Fourteen different bands were excised from the DGGE gel and sequenced;

   14 fungal taxa detected in soil, 11 fungal taxa were found on root tips,

Abstract = {{This study compares the potential of natural charcoal from Scots pine
   (Pinus sylvestris L.) and activated carbon to improve germination under
   the hypothesis that natural charcoal adsorbs phytotoxins produced by
   dwarf-shrubs, but due to it's chemical properties to a lesser extent
   than activated carbon. Activated carbon has been used in many bioassays
   as an adsorbate to clean aqueous solutions.
   We used aqueous extracts from young leaves of Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull
   and Vaccinium myrtillus (L.) as phytotoxin sources in two different
   concentrations (10 and 14 gr. of dried leaves in 100 ml distilled
   water). Germination of pine seeds was prevented by the higher
   concentration of both species, while the lower ones did not show
   significantly reduced germination. Both ericaceous species showed a very
   similar potential to prevent germination of Scots pine seeds.
   Supplemented carbon (activated carbon, powdered or granulated pine
   charcoal) restored germination in strong extracts. Adding activated
   carbon resulted in germination of almost 100\%. With pine charcoals
   added, lower germination percentages were observed. The charcoal powder
   was more effective (60\% for C. vulgaris; 28\% for V. myrtillus) than
   the charcoal granulate (30\% and 16\%, respectively) in restoring
   germination.
   Chemical and surface analysis of the three carbon supplements revealed
   that activated carbon had by far the biggest active surface area (641
   m(2) g(-1)), and thus many more cavities to bind phytotoxins than
   natural charcoal (total surface area of 142 m(2) g(-1)).
   We conclude, that charcoal produced by forest fires can have a positive
   effect on seed germination, but to a much lesser extent than activated
   carbon. Previous studies, which used activated carbon as an equivalent
   for charcoal, overestimated the effect of charcoal on germination.}},

Abstract = {{Seedlings of Eucalyptus regnans ( mountain ash) grow poorly in undried
   forest soil, where they develop purple coloration in the foliage, but
   their growth is markedly improved when forest soil has been air dried.
   Whether this growth promotion is purely due to improved nutrient status
   of the soil, as a result of air drying, was investigated. In several pot
   experiments, E. regnans seedlings were grown (i) in air-dried and
   undried forest soil with addition of different levels of complete
   fertiliser, (ii) in air- dried or undried soil diluted to different
   extents with sand, or (iii) in undried soil mixed with different amounts
   of air- dried soil. Seedling dry weight, P content and incidence of
   ectomycorrhizal root tips were determined.
   In all experiments, the dry weights of seedlings were 3-6 times greater
   in 100\% air-dried soil than in 100\% undried soil. Fertiliser
   application resulted in a significant increase in dry weight of
   seedlings in both air- dried and undried soil, but the dry weights in
   air-dried soil were always significantly greater than those in undried
   soil at the same level of fertiliser application. Even at the highest
   level of fertiliser application, the growth difference between seedlings
   in air-dried and undried soil remained. When air- dried soil was diluted
   with sand, there was a significant reduction in seedling dry weight only
   when soil was diluted to 20\% or less ( air- dried soil: total mix).
   Conversly, when air- dried soil was mixed with undried soil, there was a
   proportional decrease in seedling dry weight with increasing amounts of
   undried soil. In all experiments, the dominant ectomycorrhizal
   morphotypes in 100\% air-dried soil were different from those in undried
   soil. Fertilisation and dilution of air- dried and undried soil did not
   result in a reduction in the overall incidence of ectomycorrhizal root
   tips, although the frequency of occurrence of different ectomycorrhizal
   morphotypes was affected.
   It is concluded that the growth difference between seedlings in air-
   dried and undried forest soils is not due solely to differences in the
   direct availability of nutrients in the soils, and different
   ectomycorrhizae may indirectly affect nutrient availability to the
   plant.}},

Abstract = {{In a study of fungi growing in various root-associated habitats in and
   around Picea mariana, black spruce, in northern Ontario, Canada, an
   examination was made of the degree to which differences in growth sites
   within an area of a few square kilometers might influence the structure
   of root-associated filamentous microfungal populations. Picea mariana
   roots were collected at four strongly differing boreal forest sites: an
   undisturbed forest site with deep litter and humus layers; a recently
   regenerated forest; a clearcut, former portable sawmill site with a few
   small, naturally regenerated trees; and an open peat bog penetrated by
   roots from trees growing along the margin. Comparisons were done on
   isolate assemblages primarily from serially washed mycorrhizae,
   supplemented with comparison samples from washed root bark and adherent
   rhizosphere soil. The Bray \& Curtis similarity index and nodal
   components analysis were utilised to identify trends within the data.
   Root endophyte fungi, mainly Phialocephala fortinii and Meliniomyces
   variabilis, were among the most common isolates from serially washed
   mycorrhizae and showed strong trends among the site types, with the
   former most common from sites low in humus and also low in known
   humus-associated microfungi, and the latter most common from the peat
   bog site. The overall composition of the isolate assemblages from washed
   mycorrhizae mainly reflected site factors, with assemblages from the
   undisturbed and regenerated forest sites similar to one another and
   those from the clearcut and peat bog sites strongly distinct. A major
   difference was also seen between two seasonal samples at the exposed
   clearcut site, but few seasonal differences were seen at the other
   sites. The regenerated and undisturbed forest sites were high in
   Umbelopsis isabellina, Mortierella verticillata and Penicillium
   spinulosum, fungi typical of humic horizons in boreal podzols; the
   clearcut yielded the greatest numbers of Fusarium proliferatum,
   Umbelopsis nana and Penicillium montanense isolates, an assemblage
   tending to indicate exposed mineral soil; while the peat bog was
   typified by the presence of characteristic northern peat inhabitants
   Mortierella pulchella and P spinulosum, as well as temperate peat
   inhabitant Penicillium lividum. A synthesis of these results with other
   data suggests that as a microhabitat, the mycorrhizosphere, as
   originally defined by Foster \& Marks, is of little significance in
   determining the structure of filamentous fungal populations in soil
   influenced by the presence of ectomycorrhizal forest tree roots. Edaphic
   and overall microbial community conditions are much more significant,
   but the influence of a ``symbiorhizosphere effect{''} exerted by certain
   ectomycorrhizal symbionts within the whole soil volume they occupy is
   also known in some cases and worthy of further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Fires are critical pathways of carbon loss from boreal forest soils,
   whereas microbial communities form equally critical controls over carbon
   accumulation between fires. We used a chronosequence in Alaska to test
   Read's hypothesis that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi should dominate
   ecosystems with low accumulation of surface litter, and ectomycorrhizal
   fungi should proliferate where organic horizons are well-developed. This
   pattern is expected because ectomycorrhizal fungi display a greater
   capacity to mineralize organic compounds than do arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi. The sites were located in upland forests near Delta Junction,
   Alaska, and represent stages at 3, 15, 45, and 80 years following fire.
   Soil organic matter accumulated 2.8-fold over time. Fire did not
   noticeably reduce the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In
   contrast, ectomycorrhizal colonization required up to 15 years to return
   to pre-fire levels. As a result, dominant mycorrhizal groups shifted
   from arbuscular to ectomycorrhizal fungi as succession progressed.
   Bacterial functional diversity was greatest in the oldest sites.
   Altogether, microbes that can mineralize organic compounds (i.e.,
   ectomycorrhizae and bacteria) recovered more slowly than those that
   cannot (i.e., arbuscular mycorrhizae). Potential net N mineralization
   and standing pools of ammonium-N were relatively low in the youngest
   site. In addition, glomalin stocks were positively correlated with
   arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal length, peaking early in the
   chronosequence. Our results indicate that microbial succession may
   influence soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in the first several years
   following fire, by augmenting carbon storage in glomalin while
   inhibiting mineralization of organic compounds.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the influence of the brown rot fungus Hygrophoropsis
   aurantiaca on P solubility in the humus layer of a podzolic forest soil.
   This fungus is known to exude large amounts of oxalic acid that may
   stimulate weathering of minerals and increase dissolution of humus,
   which in turn may increase P availability in the soil surrounding the
   fungus. Humus was inoculated using small wooden pieces colonised by the
   fungus. The presence of the fungus resulted in elevated concentration of
   PO4- in the humus solution. In a second experiment birch 4 seedlings
   grown in the same humus were able to utilise the PO4- mobilised by the
   fungus to increase their internal P content. The factor 4 determining
   this increased P uptake and the increased available P might be oxalate
   produced by fungus. The acid may directly dissolve P or change organic
   forms of P making it more susceptible to reaction with phosphatases.
   This fungal effect on P solubility diminished when N was added to the
   soil in the form of a slow release N fertilizer (methyl urea), or when a
   soil with a higher soil N concentration was used. We found a strong
   correlation between NH4+ concentration and total organic carbon in the
   soil solution at high NH4+ concentrations, suggesting the dissolution of
   humus as a result of the high NH4+ content in the solution. This study
   demonstrates that the wood-decaying fungus H. aurantiaca influences
   nutrient turnover in forest soil, and thereby nutrient uptake by forest
   trees. An intensified harvest of forest products such as whole tree
   harvesting may decrease the active biomass of the wood decomposers and
   may thereby change the availability of P and the leaching of N. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{In south-central Chile, basal area and wood volume development of
   Nothofagus spp. in some forests has been shown to be independent of that
   of associated tree species. Although this has been attributed to the
   emergent habit of Nothofagus, here we explore the possible role of
   belowground resource partitioning. We measured fine root biomass and
   vertical distribution of emergent Nothofagus dombeyi and its canopy
   associates in an old-growth rain forest, to test for evidence of
   vertical partitioning of belowground resources. Fine roots were sampled
   to a depth of 80 cm in three plots. Total fine root biomass averaged
   4685 gm(-1) ,N. dombeyi contributing about 22\% of this figure. Roots
   were concentrated mainly in the upper horizons, with 69\% of the total
   occurring at <30 cm. However, fine root biomass of N. dombeyi declined
   significantly more steeply with depth than that of its associates did,
   the average contribution of N. dombeyi to total fine root biomass
   decreasing from 29\% in the uppermost 10 cm, to little more than 1\% at
   70-80 cm. The observed differences in rooting depth could be linked to
   differences in mycorrhizal syndromes: ectomycorrhizal Nothofagus might
   be expected to be more shallow-rooted than the VAM and nonmycorrhizal
   canopy species, because of the reportedly greater ability of
   ectomycorrhizal species to assimilate organic nitrogen from the litter
   layer. A degree of belowground resource use complementarity may
   therefore minimize competition between N. dombeyi and its associates.

Abstract = {{Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are an important class of
   persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environment and accumulate
   in forest soils. These soils are often dominated by ectomycorrhizal
   (EcM) roots, but little is known about how EcM fungi degrade PAHs, or
   the overall effect of field colonized EcM roots on the fate of PAHs.
   The ability of eight EcM fungi to degrade PAHs in liquid culture spiked
   with C-14 labelled PAHs was investigated. Microcosms were used to
   determine the impact of naturally colonized mycorrhizal pine seedlings
   on PAH mineralization and volatilization.
   Only two EcM fungi (Thelephora terrestris and Laccaria laccata) degraded
   at least one PAH and none were able to mineralize the PAHs in pure
   culture. Where degradation occurred, the compounds were only
   mono-oxygenated. EcM pine seedlings did not alter naphthalene
   mineralization or volatilization but retarded fluorene mineralization by
   35\% compared with unplanted, ectomycorrhizosphere soil inoculated,
   microcosms.
   The EcM fungi possessed limited PAH degrading abilities, which may
   explain why EcM dominated microcosms retarded fluorene mineralization.
   This observation is considered in relation to the `Gadgil-effect', where
   retarded litter decomposition has been observed in the presence of EcM
   roots.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of mycorrhizas in heathland and boreal forest biomes,
   which together cover much of the landmass of the Northern Hemisphere and
   store most of the global stocks of carbon, is reviewed. The taxonomic
   affinities of the organisms forming these symbiotic partnerships are
   assessed, and the distinctive structural features of the ericoid
   mycorrhizas of heathland dwarf shrubs and the ectomycorrhizas of boreal
   forest trees are described. It is stressed that neither in terms of the
   geographical distribution of the plants nor in terms of the occurrence
   of their characteristic mycorrhizas in the soil profile should these
   biomes be considered to be mutually exclusive. What unites them is their
   apparent affinity for acidic organic soils of inherently low
   accessibility of the major nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P).
   These properties relate directly to the nature of the nutrient-poor
   recalcitrant litter produced by their host plants and through
   positive-feedback mechanisms that are reinforced by selective removal of
   labile nutrients by the mycorrhizas. We suggest that coevolution of
   these plant litter traits with mycorrhizal associations that are adapted
   to them has been one of the defining features of these ecosystems.
   Ericoid and ectomycorrhizal fungi have biochemical and physiological
   attributes that make them highly efficient at scavenging for organic
   sources of N and P in surface soil horizons. In so doing, they restrict
   supplies of these elements to the decomposer communities. Case studies
   involving exploitation of N and P in defined organic substrates are
   described. In both biomes the dominant plants depend upon the abilities
   of their fungal partners to recover nutrients, so the symbioses control
   nutrient cycles, productivity, species composition, and functioning of
   these ecosystems. It is in this context that the fungal symbionts are
   here considered to be drivers of nutritional processes in their
   respective biomes. Through their influences upon the quality of carbon
   residues mycorrhizal fungi must also affect the sink-source balance for
   this key element in soil. There is an urgent need for the evaluation of
   the relative contributions of symbiotic and saprotrophic components of
   the microflora to the processes of carbon storage and cycling in these
   biomes, particularly in the context of global climate change and impacts
   of anthropogenic pollutant N deposition.}},

Abstract = {{We examined how chronic nitrogen (N) enrichment of pine and hardwood
   forest stands has affected the relative abundance, functional capacity,

   one soil core (5.6 cm diameter; organic horizon plus 10 cm of mineral
   soil) from each of four 5 m x 5 m subplots within the control, low N (5
   g N m(-2) per year), and high N (15 N m(-2) per year) plots in both the
   hardwood and pine stands at the Chronic Nitrogen Amendment Study at
   Harvard Forest. The samples were analyzed for total and active bacterial
   and fungal biomass, microbial catabolic response profiles, the
   activities of cellulolytic and ligninolytic enzymes, and total, labile
   and microbially derived organic carbon (C). Live, fine roots were also
   collected from the control and low N pine plots and analyzed for
   ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition and diversity. Active
   fungal biomass was 27-61\% and 42-69\% lower in the fertilized compared
   to control plots in the hardwood and pine stands, respectively. Active
   bacterial biomass was not greatly affected by N additions, resulting in
   significantly lower fungal:bacterial biomass ratios in the N-treated
   plots. This shift in microbial community composition was accompanied by
   a significant reduction in the activity of phenol oxidase, a
   lignin-degrading enzyme produced by white-rot fungi. In the pine stand,
   ectomycorrhizal fungal community diversity was lower in the low
   N-treated plot than in the control plot. Differences in ectomycorrhizal
   community structure were also detected between control and fertilized
   pine plots, including a reduction in those species with the highest
   relative frequencies in the control community. Finally, N enrichment
   altered the pattern of microbial substrate use, with the relative
   response to the addition of carboxylic acids and carbohydrates being
   significantly lower in the N-treated plots, even after the data were
   normalized to account for differences in microbial biomass. These
   patterns are consistent with lower decomposition rates and altered N

Abstract = {{Chronic N additions to forest ecosystems can enhance soil N
   availability, potentially leading to reduced C allocation to root
   systems. This in turn could decrease soil CO2 efflux. We measured soil
   respiration during the first, fifth, sixth and eighth years of simulated
   atmospheric NO3- deposition (3 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) to four sugar
   maple-dominated northern hardwood forests in Michigan to assess these
   possibilities. During the first year, soil respiration rates were
   slightly, but not significantly, higher in the NO3--amended plots. In
   all subsequent measurement years, soil respiration rates from
   NO3--amended soils were significantly depressed. Soil temperature and
   soil matric potential were measured concurrently with soil respiration
   and used to develop regression relationships for predicting soil
   respiration rates. Estimates of growing season and annual soil CO2
   efflux made using these relationships indicate that these C fluxes were
   depressed by 15\% in the eighth year of chronic NO3- additions. The
   decrease in soil respiration was not due to reduced C allocation to
   roots, as root respiration rates, root biomass, and root turnover were
   not significantly affected by N additions. Aboveground litter also was
   unchanged by the 8 years of treatment. Of the remaining potential causes
   for the decline in soil CO2 efflux, reduced microbial respiration
   appears to be the most likely possibility. Documented reductions in
   microbial biomass and the activities of extracellular enzymes used for

   uptake was higher in older beech than in older pine trees. Humus quality

Abstract = {{We compared the understory herb and shrub communities of
   pre-commercially thinned and unthinned young- and old-growth Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands. Sites were located in the Cascade
   Mountains of western Oregon. Young stands were approximately 40 years
   old at the time of sampling; thinning occurred 20 years earlier.
   Although tree spacing was wider in thinned than in unthinned stands,
   faster tree growth in thinned stands meant that thinning had no
   long-term effect on basal area of P. menziesii. The very large, widely
   spaced P. menziesii individuals in old-growth stands contributed similar
   basal area as the smaller trees in young stands; however, old stands had
   much higher basal area of shade-tolerant conifers. Although low shrubs
   responded positively to thinning, the difference in cover between
   thinned and unthinned stands was too small to be statistically
   significant. Ordination of sample plots in terms of their understory
   shrub and herb species composition identified a strong gradient in
   community composition from young to old-growth stands. Understory
   species associated with old growth included both gap specialists and
   those that may be dependent on the litter depth and mycorrhizal fungi of
   old-growth forest floors. Although both thinned and unthinned young
   stand composition were quite distinct from that of old-growth stands,
   thinned stands were more similar to old growth than were unthinned
   stands. Thinned stands had higher frequency of late-seral herbs than did
   unthinned stands. Forest generalist and release species showed mixed
   responses to thinning. We conclude that pre-commercial thinning may be a
   useful management toot to encourage old growth associated understory
   herbs without precipitating dominance of the understory by low shrubs
   and weedy species. Although thinning did accelerate tree growth, changes
   in the understory appear to have been precipitated by the transient

   polymorphism (RFLP) typing. Habitat associations were tested by
   measurements on 64 plots in the Coast and Cascade Ranges of northwestern
   Oregon. Data analysis found that stand age and well-decayed, coarse,
   woody debris were related significantly to the probability of C.
   tubaeformis occurrence buts not to standing crop biomass. Results
   indicated the volume of well-decayed CWD is particularly important to
   the probability of C. tubaeformis occurrence in stands less than 100 yr
   of age. Well-decayed CWD was the substratum for 88\% of C. tubaeformis
   sporocarps across all stands, despite the fact that ground area coverage
   of CWD ranged only from 3 to 26\%. Slope, elevation and aspect were not
   related to the probability of C. tubaeformis occurrence or standing crop
   biomass. The occurrence of C. tubaeformis in northwestern Oregon is
   highly correlated to the presence of western hemlock (Tsuga
   heterophylla), and their mycorrhizal association was confirmed.
   Craterellus tubaeformis also can form mycorrhizae with Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) but is
   encountered only rarely in stands without a hemlock component. In
   northwestern Oregon, the presence of Hydnum spp. in a stand is a good
   indicator of the presence of C. tubaeformis. Differences in genetic
   sequences between C. tubaeformis populations in western North America,
   eastern North America and Europe suggest the likelihood of several
   distinct species.}},

Abstract = {{Lepiotaceous fungi form relatively fragile basidiocarps with white,
   rarely coloured, spores. Most are saprotrophic forest-floor dwellers
   that grow in the lower litter layers of the soil, and probably decompose
   lignin and cellulose. They occur worldwide, with many representatives in
   tropical and temperate regions, and a few species in arctic-alpine areas
   and in deserts. Most taxa are agaricoid, though a relatively small
   number of secotioid variants exist. Because of their relative rarity,
   the clustering together of many species in limited habitats, and the
   differences in species composition along latitudinal transects,
   lepiotaceous fungi may be vulnerable to changes in the environment, both
   on a local (habitat destruction) and on a global scale (climate change).
   Sister taxa occur in different parts of the temperate zones of the
   Northern Hemisphere, indicating that vicariance events might have played
   a role in speciation. A few species have a very extended distribution,
   and those species occur either in man-made habitats or else in cooler
   habitats. Many ecological features of the lepiotaceous fungi are
   unknown, including the survival rates and colonization success of
   spores, nutrient and temperature requirements, longevity and size of
   genets. Conservation of existing diversity calls for policies
   underpinned by new ecological research, more taxonomical studies, and
   more recording projects.}},

Abstract = {{Only a small fraction of the carbon (C) allocated belowground by trees
   is retained by soils in long-lived, decay-resistant forms, yet because
   of the large magnitude of terrestrial primary productivity, even small
   changes in C allocation or retention can alter terrestrial C storage.
   The humid tropics exert a disproportionately large influence over
   terrestrial C storage, but C allocation and belowground retention in
   these ecosystems remain poorly quantified. Using mass balance and C-13
   isotope methods, we examined the effects of afforestation and
   fertilization, two land-use changes of large-scale importance, on
   belowground C cycling at a humid tropical site in Hawaii. Here we report
   that in unfertilized plots, 80\% of the C allocated belowground by trees
   to roots and mycorrhizae was returned to the atmosphere within 1 year;
   9\% of the belowground C flux was retained in coarse roots and 11\% was
   retained as new soil C. The gains in new soil C were offset entirely by
   losses of old soil C. Further, while fertilization early in stand
   development increased C storage in the litter layer and in coarse roots,
   it reduced by 22\% the flux of C moving through roots and mycorrhizae
   into mineral soils. Because soil C formation rates related strongly to
   rhizosphere C flux, fertilization may reduce an already limited capacity
   of these forests to sequester decay-resistant soil C.}},

Abstract = {{The filamentous fungi have dynamic and variable hyphal structures within
   which cytoplasm can be moved, synthesized, and degraded, in response to
   changes in environmental conditions, resource availability, and resource
   distribution. Their study has gone through several phases. In the first
   phase, direct observation was emphasized without undue concern for
   interior structures or in the presence of cytoplasm. By the mid-1970s,
   single biochemical proxies (ergosterol, marker fatty acids, chitin
   derivatives, etc.) were being used increasingly. The use of these
   surrogate single measurements continues, in spite of their inability to
   provide information on the physical structure of the filamentous fungi.
   Molecular approaches also are being used, primarily through the use of
   bulk nucleic acid extraction and cloning. Because the sources of the
   nucleic acids used in such studies usually are not known, taxonomic and
   phylogenetic information derived by this approach cannot be linked to
   specific fungal structures. Recently, a greater emphasis has been place
   on assessing physical aspects of indeterminate fungal growth, involving
   the assessment of cytoplasm-filled and evacuated (empty) hyphae. Both of
   these parameters are important for describing filamentous fungal growth
   and function. The use of phase contrast microscopy and varied general
   stains, as well as fluorogenic substrates with observation by
   epifluorescence microscopy, has made it possible to provide estimates of
   cytoplasm-filled hyphal lengths. Using this approach, it has been
   possible to evaluate the responses of the indeterminate fungal community
   to changes in environmental conditions, including soil management. it is
   now possible to obtain molecular information from individual bacteria
   and fungal structures (hyphae, spores, fruiting bodies) recovered from
   environments, making it possible to link individual fungal structures
   with their taxonomic and phylogenetic information. In addition, this
   information can be considered in the context of the indeterminate
   filamentous fungal lifestyle, involving the dynamics of resource
   allocation to hyphal structural development and synthesis of cytoplasm.
   Use of this approach should make it possible to gain a greater
   appreciation of the indeterminate filamentous fungal lifestyle,

Abstract = {{Until recently, the common view of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle had
   been driven by two core assumptions-plants use only inorganic N and they
   compete poorly against soil microbes for N. Thus, plants were thought to
   use N that microbes ``left over,{''} allowing the N cycle to be divided
   cleanly into two pieces-the microbial decomposition side and the plant
   uptake and use side. These were linked by the process of net
   mineralization. Over the last decade, research has changed these views.
   N cycling is now seen as being driven by the depolymerization of
   N-containing polymers by microbial (including mycorrhizal) extracellular
   enzymes. This releases organic N-containing monomers that may be used by
   either plants or microbes. However, a complete new conceptual model of
   the soil N cycle needs to incorporate recent research on plant-microbe
   competition and microsite processes to explain the dynamics of N across
   the wide range of N availability found in terrestrial ecosystems. We
   discuss the evolution of thinking about the soil N cycle, propose a new
   integrated conceptual model that explains how N cycling changes as
   ecosystem N availability changes, and discuss methodological issues
   raised by the changing paradigm of terrestrial N cycling.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their high abundance and ubiquitous existence, microbes are
   considered to be efficient colonisers of newly established habitats. To
   shed light on the dispersal mechanisms of soil microbes, a controlled
   microcosm experiment was established. In these microcosms, the dispersal
   of microbes from a source humus patch to originally sterile humus
   patches (embedded in a mineral soil matrix) was followed for 16 months,
   applying 16S and 18S ribosomal DNA-based PCR-DGGE molecular methods.
   Specifically, the role of enchytraeid worms and habitat (humus)
   corridors as possible facilitators of microbe dispersal was studied. The
   results showed that enchytraeid worms function efficiently as vectors
   for horizontal dispersal of saprophytic fungi in soil. Some of the fungi
   also proved to disperse through the corridors by vegetative growth,
   although this dispersal was inefficient as compared to dispersal with
   the enchytraeids. Virtually no saprophytic fungi were able to disperse
   through the mineral soil matrix in the absence of both enchytraeid worms
   and corridors. Unlike soil fungi, the dispersal of soil bacteria was not
   affected by any of the studied factors. The results of the present
   experiment provide direct evidence of the crucial role of soil fauna in
   aiding the horizontal dispersal of soil fungi. The role of enchytraeids
   as a functionally important species in boreal forest soils is further
   emphasized, since bringing microbes into contact with new resources is
   likely to enhance the rate of decomposition in soils.}},

Abstract = {{Soluble organic N and microbial N pools in terrestrial ecosystems have
   been less studied than those of inorganic N. Therefore, cross-system
   variation in their pool sizes and seasonal dynamics, both absolute and
   relative to inorganic N pools, needs to be quantified so that their
   ecological importance in different ecosystems can be evaluated. We
   measured extractable soil organic N (ESON), microbial biomass N (MBN),
   and the net production rates of ESON in red oak-dominated remnant
   forests, along an urban-rural gradient in the New York City metropolitan
   area. We were interested in (1) determining the seasonal dynamics of
   ESON and MBN, and (2) examining whether the contrasts in land use
   (urban, suburban, rural) surrounding these forest remnants were
   associated with different amounts of ESON and MBN. This field-based
   study was conducted continuously for 16 months. Yearly average ESON
   concentrations ranged from 60 to 140 mg kg(-1) soil organic matter
   (SOM), 3-4 times those of inorganic N, and average MBN ranged from 600
   to 1100 mg kg(-1) SOM. There was a considerable MBN increase in spring
   in all plots across the gradient. The average increase expressed on an
   areal basis (to a depth of 7.5 cm) ranged from 1.75 to 4.19 a N m(-2).
   The N incorporated into the microbial biomass in spring was gradually
   released later in the growing season (the mean MBN decrease ranged from
   1.11 to 3.82 g N m(-2)). The spring MBN increase could be an important
   retention mechanism for conserving soil inorganic N when plant N uptake
   may be low. The amplitude in the seasonal dynamics of ESON was far less
   than that of inorganic N, as was that of net ESON production rates when
   compared to net N mineralization. These suggest a closer coupling of
   plant N uptake with inorganic N, much more than with ESON. Both ESON and
   MBN were significantly higher in rural soils than in urban soils, and
   both concentrations were positively correlated with SOM content. The
   variation in ESON, MBN, or SOM associated with this urbanization
   gradient suggests that the form of N exported, the plant N budget and
   soil N retention mechanisms may be differentially affected by urban,
   suburban and rural land uses. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Incident rainfall is a major source of nutrient input to a forest
   ecosystem and the consequent throughfall and stemflow contribute to
   nutrient cycling. These rain-based fluxes were measured over 12 mo in
   two forest types in Korup National Park, Cameroon, one with low (LEM)
   and one with high (HEM) ectomycorrhizal abundances of trees. Throughfall
   was 96.6 and 92.4\% of the incident annual rainfall (5370 mm) in LEM and
   HEM forests respectively; stemflow was correspondingly 1.5 and 2.2\%.
   Architectural analysis showed that ln(funneling ratio) declined linearly
   with increasing ln(basal area) of trees. Mean annual inputs of N, P, K,
   Mg and Ca in incident rainfall were 1.50, 1.07, 7.77, 5.25 and 9.27 kg
   ha(-1), and total rain-based inputs to the forest floor were 5.0, 3.2,
   123.4, 14.4 and 37.7 kg ha-1 respectively. The value for K is high for
   tropical forests and that for N is low. Nitrogen showed a significantly
   lower loading of throughfall and stemflow in HEM than in LEM forest,
   this being associated in the HEM forest with a greater abundance of
   epiphytic bryophytes which may absorb more N. Incident rainfall provided
   c. 35\% of the gross input of P to the forest floor (i. e., rain-based
   plus small litter inputs), a surprisingly high contribution given the
   sandy P-poor soils. At the start of the wet season leaching of K from
   the canopy was particularly high. Calcium in the rain was also highest
   at this time, most likely due to washing off of dry-deposited Harmattan
   dusts. It is proposed that throughfall has an important `priming'
   function in the rapid decomposition of litter and mineralization of P at
   the start of the wet season. The contribution of P inputted from the
   atmosphere appears to be significant when compared to the rates of P
   mineralization from leaf litter.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of a comprehensive monitoring programme conducted in a
   temperate woodland through statistical analysis and simulation modelling
   is presented here. The Heron Wood Reserve in Peebleshire, Scotland is a
   7.5-ha wood, left untended to facilitate investigation into a natural
   Scottish Woodland Ecosystem. Data on fungal fruiting have been collected
   since 1994, and since November 2000 physico-chemical and biotic
   experiments on soil and woodland litter have also been conducted with
   the aim to construct and integrate a number of simulation submodels of
   the various ecological systems present in an untended Scottish woodland.
   Important systems for modelling include patterns of fungal succession,
   habitat characteristics and fungal biochemical patterns. A large volume
   of data has been collected so computer software is used for the storage
   and handling of data. Microsoft Access was the database used for
   storage; integration of functions available in Microsoft Excel with a
   customised software written in Microsoft Visual Basic and Microsoft VBA
   allowed various statistical modelling tests (e.g. Scheffe analysis of
   contrast) to be carried out, and the quick display of data in a suitable
   manner. Model Maker software is used to construct and test simulation
   models formulated from the data and ultimately to facilitate the running
   of various simulations. Integration of the separate lines of
   investigation is demonstrated on the example of a case study describing
   differences in the dynamics of decomposers in beech- and birch-dominated
   habitats. Integration of the information obtained allowed us to put
   forward the following hypothesis. The leaf litter produced by beech
   trees is of lower quality compared to birch, and decomposition in
   beech-dominated habitats is delayed (i.e. in comparison to
   birch-dominated) because of the differences in the extent to which these
   plants create and maintain a litter and humus layer (sensu Wardle,
   Communities and Ecosystems. Linking the Aboveground and Belowground
   Components, Princeton University Press, Princeton. 2002). Hence, the
   decomposition in beech-dominated habitats mainly occurs somewhat deeper
   in the soil profile, and may be carried out with some considerable
   involvement of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The correct understanding of the
   site-specific peculiarities of the ecological patterns is important for

Title = {{Coupling fine root dynamics with ecosystem carbon cycling in black
   spruce forests of interior Alaska}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{643-662}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Fine root processes play a prominent role in the carbon and nutrient
   cycling of boreal ecosystems due to the high proportion of biomass
   allocated belowground and the rapid decomposition of fine roots relative
   to aboveground tissues. To examine these issues in detail, major
   components of ecosystem carbon flux were studied in three mature black
   spruce forests in interior Alaska, where fine root production,
   respiration, mortality and decomposition, and aboveground production of
   trees, shrubs, and mosses were measured relative to soil CO2 fluxes.
   Fine root production, measured over a two-year period using
   minirhizotrons, varied from 0.004 +/- 0.001 mm.cm(-2).d(-1) over winter,
   to 0.051 +/- 0.015 mm.cm(-2).d(-1) during July, with peak growing season
   values comparable to those reported for many temperate forests using
   similar methods. On average, 84\% of this production occurred Within 20
   cm of the moss surface, although the proportion occurring in deeper
   profiles increased as soils gradually warmed throughout the summer.
   Monthly rates of production and mortality were somewhat asynchronous
   because mortality tended to peak during fall and be minimal during
   periods of peak production. Production and mortality were, however,
   positively correlated across all tubes and lime periods. Annual fine
   root production averaged 2.45 +/- 0.31, 8.01 +/- 1.39, and 2.53 +/- 0.27
   mm.cm(-2).yr(-1) (means +/- 1 SE) among the three sites, when averaged
   across years. Fine root survival and decomposition were measured by
   tracking and analyzing the fate of individual fine roots using
   mark-recapture techniques.
   Fine root survival was greatest during periods of peak root growth, and
   least over winter (phi(time)). Roots first appearing in the middle of
   the growing season had higher survival rates than those first appearing
   early or late in the growing season, or over winter (phi(cohort)) and
   risk of mortality decreased With root age (phi(age)). Survival estimates
   translate to mean life spans of 108 +/- 4.d during the growing, season.
   While these values are in striking contrast to needle longevity and
   rates of aboveground litter decomposition, they are similar to many
   values found for temperate systems, supporting the notion.-that there
   are basic morphological and physiological traits of first-order roots
   that are common to most woody plant root systems. During the growing
   season, monthly fine root decomposition rates averaged 0.46 +/- 0.01 per
   month, while decomposition rates over winter averaged 0.73 +/- 0.01 per
   winter. These growing season estimates translate to 49 +/- 2 d from the
   time a root was first observed as dead, to the time it disappeared. For
   roots that decomposed during the growing season, those with longer life
   spans decomposed more slowly after death. Comparing these results with
   other minirhizotron studies suggests that life-history traits of black
   spruce first-order roots are similar to those from temperate (and
   perhaps most) forest ecosystems.
   Annual production of fine roots averaged 228 +/- 75 g
   biomass.m(-2).yr(-1), constituting similar to56\% of total stand
   production. Aboveground production of trees (50 +/- 14 g
   biomass.m(-2).yr(-1), 13\%) and shrubs (40 +/- 2 g biomass-m(-2).yr(-1),
   11\%) contributed similarly to total production, while mosses (73 +/- 14
   g biomass.m(-2).yr(-1), 20\%) accounted for the largest component of
   aboveground production. Soil temperature had a strong control over both
   soil respiration (Q(10) = 2.21 +/- 0.31) and root respiration (Q(10) =
   2.30 +/- 0.37). During the growing season (15 May to 15 September),
   similar to56\% of soil CO2 efflux (580 +/- 40 g C/m(2)) was-derived from
   fine root respiration (329 +/- 54 g C/m(2)). Although apparent rates of
   heterotrophic respiration (May through September) and total production
   did licit-differ, definitive estimates of net ecosystem production are
   impossible given the potentially large, unmeasured components of NPP
   (net primary production), such as root exudation and mycorrhizal
   production. Nevertheless, rates of fine root production, mortality, and
   decomposition indicate that in these black spruce ecosystems, fine roots
   are much more dynamic than would be predicted from patterns of
   aboveground processes, and that carbon, and presumably nutrients, are
   cycling through fine roots at rates several orders of magnitude faster
   than through aboveground tissues.}},

Abstract = {{In tropical rain forests the rate of litterfall is high, and is the most

   hypotheses using seedlings of dipterocarp species: (1) addition of leaf
   litter improves growth; (2) and litter addition affects both
   ectomycorrhizal (ECM) colonization and community structure.
   Three dipterocarp species with contrasting ecologies (Parashorea
   tomentella, Hopea nervosa and Dryobalanops lanceolata) were grown in a
   nursery in forest soil with or without the addition of litter.
   Litter addition improved the growth of all three species. There was no
   effect of litter addition on total percentage ECM colonization but ECM
   diversity and percentage colonization by Cenococcum geophilum were lower
   with litter addition. Foliar delta(15)N was lower in two of the three
   species grown in the presence of litter, reflecting the lower delta(15)N
   of the litter compared with the soil. There was a negative correlation
   between delta(15)N and percentage ECM, suggesting a role for ECMs in
   accessing litter-derived N sources.
   This study shows that litter addition improved the growth of dipterocarp
   seedlings and that the ECM associations of dipterocarps facilitated
   access to this organic nutrient source. This has implications for the
   successful regeneration of seedlings in the rain forest understorey.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microorganisms are considered C-limited, while plant productivity
   is frequently N-limited. Large stores of organic C in boreal forest
   soils are attributed to negative effects of low temperature, soil
   acidity and plant residue recalcitrance upon microbial activity.
   We examined microbial activity, biomass and community composition along
   a natural 90-m-long soil N supply gradient, where plant species
   composition varies profoundly, forest productivity three-fold and soil
   pH by three units.
   There was, however, no significant variation in soil respiration in the
   field across the gradient. Neither did microbial biomass C determined by
   fumigation-extraction vary, while other estimates of activity and
   biomass showed a weak increase with increasing N supply and soil pH.
   Simultaneously, a phospholipid fatty acid attributed mainly to
   mycorrhizal fungi declined drastically, while bacterial biomass
   increased.
   We hypothesize that low N supply and plant productivity, and hence low
   litter C supply to saprotrophs is associated with a high plant C supply
   to mycorrhizal fungi, while the reverse occurs under high N supply. This
   should mean that effects of N availability on C supply to these

Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2302-2312}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Plant productivity and ecosystem productivity are strongly influenced by
   nutrient availability, Which is largely determined by the decomposition
   rate of plant litter. Belowground litter inputs (dead roots,
   mycorrhizae, and exudates) are larger than aboveground litterfall in
   many systems. Chemical quality and diameter primarily control
   decomposition for coarse roots, but these patterns do not hold for finer
   classes of roots, which are frequently colonized by mycorrhizae. Though
   mycorrhizal status is known to drastically alter toot chemistry,
   morphology, life span, and exudation, it has never been explicitly,
   considered as a factor affecting root decomposition. We hypothesize that
   mycorrhizal status substantially influences fine root decomposition
   rates.
   Both ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can
   change root properties but do,so in different ways. Dominant tree
   species of most cold and temperate forests rely heavily on EM
   associations. EM fungi form massive structures that envelop fine roots.
   Roots infected by ectomycorrhizae have higher nitrogen concentrations
   than nonmycorrhizal roots, which would be expected to increase
   decomposition rates, but much of this nitrogen is bound in recalcitrant
   forms, such as chitin, so the net effect on decomposition is difficult
   to predict. AM fungi lack elaborate, macroscopic structures and may not
   alter root chemistry as profoundly.
   In addition to mycorrhizal roots, external fungal hyphae can contribute
   significantly to ecosystem carbon budgets and thereby influence rates of
   soil carbon turnover. Hyphae have commonly been considered a rapidly
   decomposing carbon pool, though this has never been demonstrated
   experimentally. If hyphae are produced at the expense of rapidly
   decomposing root exudates, then the net effect of hyphal litter
   production might be to reduce soil microbial activity and overall carbon
   cycling rates. Based on known differences in morphology and chemistry,
   EM hyphae may be more recalcitrant than AM hyphae. In summary, we submit
   that mycorrhizal status could substantially influence fine root
   decomposition and soil carbon processing rates, potentially explaining
   some of the variation observed within and among individual plant species
   and ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Fine root distribution and turnover were investigated in ca. 40-year-old
   pure Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) stands in Germany, growing on
   four sites that differed in soil acidity (Ebergotzen < Barbis <
   Fichtelgebirge = Harz). The density of fine root biomass and necromass
   in different soil horizons differed among the sites. At one of the most
   acidic sites (Harz), fine root density in the humus layer was more than
   twice that at the least acidic site (Ebergotzen). At the two most acidic
   sites, Fichtelgebirge and Harz, the ratio of biomass to necromass was
   significantly lower than at Ebergotzen and Barbis, particularly in the
   subsoil layer. In each stand, clear vertical gradients in fine root
   length density and root tip density were observed. Most of the roots and
   the root tips were in the humus layer and in the first mineral soil
   horizon (0-10 cm). There was a significantly different decrease in
   specific root length (cm g(DM)(-1)) and specific root tip density (root
   tips g(DM)(-1)) in the more acidified stands Fichtelgebirge and Harz

Abstract = {{Limitations in available techniques to separate autotrophic (root) and
   soil heterotrophic respiration have hampered the understanding of forest
   C cycling. The former is here defined as respiration by roots, their
   associated mycorrhizal fungi and other micro-organisms in the
   rhizosphere directly dependent on labile C compounds leaked from roots.
   In order to separate the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of
   soil respiration, all Scots pine trees in 900 m(2) plots were girdled to
   instantaneously terminate the supply of current photosynthates from the
   tree canopy to roots. Hogberg et al. (Nature 411, 789-792, 2001)
   reported that autotrophic activity contributed up to 56\% of total soil
   respiration during the first summer of this experiment. They also found
   that mobilization of stored starch (and likely also sugars) in roots
   after girdling caused an increased apparent heterotrophic respiration on
   girdled plots. Herein a transient increase in the delta(13)C Of Soil
   CO(2) efflux after girdling, thought to be due to decomposition of
   (13)C-enriched ectomycorrhizal mycelium and root starch and sugar
   reserves, is reported. In the second year after girdling, when starch
   reserves of girdled tree roots were exhausted, calculated root
   respiration increased up to 65\% of total soil CO(2) efflux. It is
   suggested that this estimate of its contribution to soil respiration is
   more precise than the previous based on one year of observation.
   Heterotrophic respiration declined in response to a 20-day-long 6
   degreesC decline in soil temperature during the second summer, whereas
   root respiration did not decline. This did not support the idea that
   root respiration should be more sensitive to variations in soil
   temperature. It is suggested that above-ground photosynthetic activity
   and allocation patterns of recent photosynthates to roots should be
   considered in models of responses of forest C balances to global climate
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing soil nutrients through litter manipulation, pollution, or
   fertilization can adversely affect ectomycorrhizal (EM) communities by
   inhibiting fungal growth. In this study, we used molecular genetic
   methods to determine the effects of litter addition on the EM community
   of a Pinus contorta stand in Yellowstone National Park that regenerated
   after a stand-replacing fire. Two controls were used; in unmodified
   control plots nothing was added to the soil, and in perlite plots
   perlite, a chemically neutral substance, was added to maintain soil
   moisture and temperature at levels similar to those under litter. We
   found that (i) species richness did not change significantly following
   perlite addition (2.6 +/- 0.3 species/core in control plots, compared
   with 2.3 +/- 0.3 species/core in perlite plots) but decreased
   significantly (P < 0.05) following litter addition (1.8 +/- 0.3
   species/core); (ii) EM infection was not affected by the addition of
   perlite but increased significantly (P < 0.001) in response to litter
   addition, and the increase occurred only in the upper soil layer,
   directly adjacent to the added litter; and (iii) Suillus granulatus,
   Wilcoxina mikolae, and agaricoid DD were the dominant organisms in
   controls, but the levels of W. mikolde and agaricoid DD decreased
   significantly in response to both perlite and litter addition. The
   relative levels of S. granulatus and a fourth fungus, Cortinariaceae
   species 2, increased significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively)
   following litter addition. Thus, litter addition resulted in some
   negative effects that may be attributable to moisture-temperature
   relationships rather than to the increased nutrients associated with
   litter. Some species respond positively to litter addition, indicating
   that there are differences in their physiologies. Hence, changes in the
   EM community induced by litter accumulation also may affect ecosystem
   function.}},

Abstract = {{The number of fruiting bodies of ectomycorrhizal species in pine forests

   Scots pine forest in Dwingeloo, The Netherlands, were investigated
   previously from 1990 to 1993. Removal of the litter and humus resulted
   in a significant increase in the numbers of species and fruiting bodies
   of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, until now all data were obtained by
   counting fruiting bodies and the effects on mycelial development below
   ground were not assessed. To investigate hyphal development, DNA was
   extracted from bulk soil and polymerase chain reaction products were
   obtained by amplification using basidiomycete-specific internal

Abstract = {{Dominance of primary rain forests by the ectomycorrhizal, leguminous

   all trees greater than or equal to10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh),
   values in the upper range for tropical moist forests worldwide. The high
   basal areas for D. corymbosa were due to the prevalence of large (>150
   cm dbh), multi-stemmed individuals. Stem densities in Dicymbe plots
   ranged from 276-433 ha(-1), with D. corymbosa contributing 24.6-59.8\%.
   In three 1-ha mixed forest plots adjacent to the Dicymbe plots, D.

Abstract = {{Humus forms are the seat of most biological transformations taking place

Abstract = {{The fine root systems of three tropical montane forests differing in age
   and history were investigated in the Cordillera Talamanca, Costa Rica.
   We analyzed abundance, vertical distribution, and morphology of fine
   roots in an early successional forest (10-15 years old, FSF), a
   mid-successional forest (40 years old, MSF), and a nearby undisturbed
   old-growth forest (OGF), and related the root data to soil morphological
   and chemical parameters. The OGF stand contained a 19 cm deep organic
   layer on the forest floor (i.e., 530 mol C/m(2)) which was two and five
   times thicker than that of the MSF (10 cm) and ESF stands (4 cm),
   respectively. There was a corresponding decrease in fine root biomass in
   this horizon from 1128 g dry matter/m(2) in the old-growth forest to 337
   (MSF) and 31 g/m(2) (ESF) in the secondary forests, although the stands
   had similar leaf areas. The organic layer was a preferred substrate for
   fine root growth in the old-growth forest as indicated by more than four
   times higher fine root densities (root mass per soil volume) than in the
   mineral topsoil (0-10 cm); in the two secondary forests, root densities
   in the organic layer were equal to or lower than in the mineral soil.
   Specific fine root surface areas and specific root tip abundance (tips
   per unit root dry mass) were significantly greater in the roots of the
   ESF than the MSF and OGF stands. Most roots of the ESF trees (8 abundant
   species) were infected by VA mycorrhizal fungi; ectomycorrhizal species
   (Quercus copeyensis and Q. costaricensis) were dominant in the MSF and
   OGF stands. Replacement of tropical montane oak forest by secondary
   forest in Costa Rica has resulted in (1) a large reduction of tree fine
   root biomass; (2) a substantial decrease in depth of the organic layer
   (and thus in preferred rooting space); and (3) a great loss of soil
   carbon and nutrients. Whether old-growth Quercus forests maintain a very
   high fine root biomass because their ectomycorrhizal rootlets are less
   effective in nutrient absorption than those of VA mycorrhizal secondary
   forests, or if their nutrient demand is much higher than that of
   secondary forests (despite a similar leaf area and leaf mass
   production), remains unclear.}},

Abstract = {{Glomalin is a soil proteinaceous substance produced by arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi. Most of the information available concerning this

   In this study, we explored the distribution of glomalin across soil
   horizons, decomposition of glomalin, and relationship with soil C and N
   in an agricultural field, a native forest, and an afforested system.
   Glomalin was present in A, B, and C horizons in decreasing
   concentrations. Land-use type significantly affected glomalin
   concentrations (mg cm(-3)), with native forest soils having the highest
   concentrations of the three land-use types in both A and B horizons. In
   terms of glomalin stocks (Mg ha(-1)), calculated based on corrected
   horizon weights, the agricultural area was significantly lower than both
   afforested and native forest areas. As measured after a 413 day
   laboratory soil incubation, glomalin was least persistent in the A
   horizon of the afforested area.. In agricultural soils and native soils,
   ca. 50\% of glomalin was still remaining after this incubation,
   indicating that some glomalin may be in the slow or recalcitrant soil C
   fraction. Comparison of glomalin decomposition with CO2-C respired
   during incubation indicates that glomalin makes a large contribution to
   active soil organic C pools. Soil C and N were highly correlated with
   glomalin across all soils and within each land-use type, indicating that
   glomalin may be under similar controls as soil C. Our results show that
   glomalin may be useful as an indicator of land-use change effects on
   deciduous forest soils.}},

   Active fine root biomass was significantly lower in the 10-ha clearcuts

   fine root biomass was often lower in the 1.0-ha opening than in the
   0.1-ha and control plots. A similar trend was established for inactive
   fine root biomass, although this was not consistent over sampling years.
   Nutrient concentrations of K, but no other elements, were higher in

Abstract = {{Adaptive management is a key component of a forest project being
   implemented across all of Weyerhaeuser's coastal forest tenures. This
   project uses two main tools to accomplish the British Columbia (BC)
   Coastal Group's ecological and socio-economic goals: variable retention
   (VR) harvesting and broad zoning of the land base. The adaptive
   management program was designed to examine the effectiveness of
   retention systems and zoning in maintaining those forest attributes
   necessary to sustain biological richness and essential ecosystem
   functions, such as nutrient transfer, energy flow, decomposition, and
   dispersal of seeds, spores, and animals. The program is grounded on
   three biological indicators evaluated in both operational and
   experimental contexts: 1) representation of habitat types in a
   relatively unmanaged state to ensure that little-known species are
   retained; 2) structure of stands and landscapes to ensure that key
   elements are present through time; and 3) indicator organisms to track
   whether retaining structures and patterns, while addressing
   representation, will maintain species and populations whose life needs
   are well understood. Representation of ecosystems in unmanaged
   conditions has been examined. Habitat structure is being assessed in VR
   blocks and in unmanaged blocks. Studies on several organisms (breeding
   birds, owls, gastropods, amphibians, bryophytes, lichen, squirrels,
   mycorrhizae, and carabid beetles) have been underway for various lengths
   of time. These studies collected baseline information to begin
   comparisons of the effectiveness of the various types of VR for
   maintaining biological richness. The current focus in the adaptive
   management program is refining the lists of specific elements to monitor
   and beginning to create tools to help extrapolate relationships and
   findings over large areas and long time frames, with the expectation of
   operational implementation in 2003. The first two years of pilot work
   are also being used to examine how the results will link to management
   practices to strengthen areas that most need improvement. This paper
   describes three indicators used in Weyerhaeuser's adaptive management

Abstract = {{We studied soil organic carbon (C) chemistry at the mountain birch
   forest-tundra ecotone in three regions of the Fennoscandian mountain
   range with comparable vegetation cover but contrasting degrees of
   continentality and latitude. The aim of the study was to identify
   functional compound classes and their relationships to decomposition and
   spatial variation across the ecotone and latitudinal gradient.
   Solid-state (13) C nuclear magnetic resonance (CPMAS (13) C NMR) was
   used to identify seven functional groups of soil organic C: alkyls ,
   N-alkyls , O-alkyls , acetals , aromatics , phenolics and carboxyls .
   N-alkyls , O-alkyls and acetals are generally considered labile
   substrates for a large number of saprotrophic fungi and bacteria, whilst
   phenolics and aromatics are mainly decomposed by lignolytic organisms
   and contribute to the formation of soil organic matter together with
   aliphatic alkyls and carboxyls . All soils contained a similar
   proportional distribution of functional groups, although relatively high
   amounts of N-alkyls , O-alkyls and acetals were present in comparison to
   earlier published studies, suggesting that large amounts of soil C were
   potentially vulnerable to microbial degradation. Soil organic matter
   composition was different at the most southerly site (Dovrefjell,
   Norway), compared with the two more northerly sites (Abisko, Sweden, and
   Joatka, Norway), with higher concentrations of aromatics and phenolics ,
   as well as pronounced differences in alkyl concentrations between forest
   and tundra soils. Clear differences between mountain birch forest and
   tundra heath soil was noted, with generally higher concentrations of
   labile carbon present in tundra soils. We conclude that, although mesic
   soils around the forest-tundra ecotone in Fennoscandia are a potential
   source of C to the atmosphere in a changing environment, the response is
   likely to vary between comparable ecosystems in relation to latitude and
   continentality as well as soil properties especially soil nitrogen

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizas may interact with saprotrophic microorganisms to

   We buried mesh envelopes filled with either litter or F-layer material
   in the forest floor of a Pinus resinosa plantation. After 16 months we
   characterized decomposition, C:N ratio, water content, and the density
   of four ectomycorrhiza morphotypes.
   For both substrates there were negative correlations between
   ectomycorrhiza density and decomposition, and between ectomycorrhiza
   density and water content. The relative proportion of morphotypes was
   significantly different in litter and F-layer material buried at the
   same depth in the forest floor.
   We conclude that the negative effect of ectomycorrhizas on decomposition
   could be mediated by extraction of water, particularly in relatively dry
   years. The `Gadgil effect' may be explained by this phenomenon. In
   wetter years, water extraction may be less consequential. Also,
   variation in substrate quality may influence the structure of

Abstract = {{In an experiment with factorial design performed in a mature, mixed
   Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris
   L.) stand in central Finland, we studied the effects of sod cutting
   (exposing the mineral soil simulating mechanical site preparation) and
   trenching the study plot (excluding root-mycorrhizal connections) on
   soil organisms, decomposition rate and pine seedling performance. During
   two growing seasons after sod cutting, the growth of pine seedlings was
   significantly enhanced compared to plots with the organic layer left
   intact. Some epiedaphic soil animals, such as ants, spiders and certain
   entomobryid collembolan, were more active (pitfall sampling) on sod-cut
   plots. By the end of the second growing season numbers of enchytraeids
   were greater in the exposed mineral soil than in the mineral soil under
   the forest floor. Trenching induced changes in microbial phospholipid
   fatty acid (PLFA) pattern and collembolan community structure with
   decreased numbers of collembolans and biomass of fungi in organic soil
   of uncut plots. In addition, N content of pine seedlings increased after
   trenching. Overall, the effects of trenching on the measured variables
   were similar in sod-cut and uncut plots. We conclude that the effects of
   mechanical site preparation on decomposers and decomposition processes
   can be explained partly by exclusion of mycorrhizal-root connections and
   partly by a decrease in unfavourable conditions created by the organic
   soil layer and ground vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the endogeic earthworm, Aporrectodea trapezoides on the

   for 10 months in the laboratory. At 5 and 10 months, differences in
   plant growth, available N and P, mycorrhizal colonization, microbial
   functional diversity and microbial activity were assessed. Douglas-fir
   seedling root biomass was greater in worm-worked compared to control
   soils. Height of seedlings varied significantly during the 5-8 months
   period of growth with taller seedlings in worm-worked soils. Foliar
   calcium levels of seedlings were higher at 10 months in worm-worked
   soils compared to the control. Effects of A. trapezoides on pH were
   unclear due to a worm x soil type interaction. Worm-worked mineral soil
   generally had higher organic matter levels compared to control soils but
   few differences were apparent in the forest floor layer. Average
   available NO3- and -NH4+ levels were higher in worm-worked forest floor
   at 10 months yet there were no differences in the mineral soil at this
   time. The effect of A. trapezoides on mycorrhizal colonization of
   Douglas-fir seedling roots differed with the different soil types
   whereby seedlings grown in pure and mixed birch soils were less
   colonized compared to the control. Average total bacterial activity,
   substrate richness and diversity were consistently higher in worm-worked
   forest floor and mineral soil compared to the control treatment. The
   trend in microbial respiration in worm-worked forest floor and mineral
   soil was not clear while effects on microbial biomass in the mineral
   soil were confounded by a worm x soil type interaction. The metabolic
   quotient was generally lower in worm-worked soils compared to control
   soils. Douglas-fir seedlings grown in pure worm-worked fir soils were
   often affected differently or more dramatically compared to seedlings
   grown in pure birch or mixed soils. The results of the experiment
   indicate that A. trapezoides has the potential to enhance Douglas-fir
   seedling growth. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{1. Mycorrhizae form a critical link between above-ground plants and the
   soil system by influencing plant nutrition, nutrient cycling and soil
   structure. Understanding how mycorrhizae respond to disturbances may
   lead to important advances in interpreting above-ground plant recovery.
   2. The inoculum potential for arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) and
   ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi was investigated in thinned-only, thinned and
   prescribed burned (both restoration treatments) and unthinned and
   unburned control stands in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. The
   relationships between mycorrhizal fungal propagule densities and plant
   community and soil properties were quantified.
   3. The relative amount of infective propagules of AM fungi was
   significantly higher in samples collected from both restoration
   treatments than their paired controls (unthinned and unburned stands).
   In contrast, the same restoration treatments had no significant effect
   on the relative amount of infective propagules of EM fungi.
   4. The relative amount of infective propagules of AM fungi was
   significantly positively correlated with graminoid cover and herbaceous
   understorey species richness and negatively correlated with overstorey
   tree canopy cover and litter cover.
   5. Synthesis and applications . These results indicate that population
   densities of AM fungi can rapidly increase following restoration
   treatments in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. This has
   important implications for restoring the herbaceous understorey of these
   forests because most understorey plants depend on AM associations for
   normal growth. These results also can be applied to other ecosystems

Abstract = {{Nutrient conservation in vegetation affects rates of litter
   decomposition and soil nutrient availability. Although resorption has
   been traditionally considered one of the most important plant strategies
   to conserve nutrients in temperate forests, long leaf life-span and low
   nutrient requirements have been postulated as better indicators. We
   aimed at identifying nutrient conservation strategies within
   characteristic functional groups of NW Patagonian forests on Andisols.
   We analysed C-, N-, P-, K- and lignin-concentrations in mature and
   senescent leaves of ten native woody species within the functional
   groups: broad-leaved deciduous species, broad-leaved evergreens and
   conifers. We also examined mycorrhizal associations in all species.
   Nutrient concentration in mature leaves and N- resorption were higher in
   broad-leaved deciduous species than in the other two functional groups.
   Conifers had low mature leaf nutrient concentrations, low N-resorption
   and high lignin/N ratios in senescent leaves. P- and K-resorptions did
   not differ among functional groups. Broad-leaved evergreens exhibited a
   species-dependent response. Nitrogen in mature leaves was positively
   correlated with both N resorption and soil N-fertility. Despite the high
   P-retention capacity of Andisols, N appeared to be the more limiting
   nutrient, with most species being proficient in resorbing N but not P.
   The presence of endomycorrhizae in all conifers and the broad-leaved
   evergreen Maytenus boaria, ectomycorrhizae in all Nothofagus species
   (four deciduous, one evergreen), and cluster roots in the broadleaved
   evergreen Lomatia hirsuta, would be possibly explaining why P is less
   limiting than N in these forests.}},

Abstract = {{Soil fungi are integral to decomposition in forests and other habitats,

   metabolic activity measured on Biolog(R) SF-P plates for 12 taxa of
   soil- and litter-inhabiting saprotrophic fungi isolated from Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii) ecosystems. To determine the relative
   assimilation of carbon from malt extract versus sucrose by C-13 stable
   isotope analyses, we cultured fungi with malt extract (consisting
   primarily of glucose and maltose) plus either C-3(-) or C-4-derived
   sucrose as carbon sources. Rhodotorula graminis and F. oxysporum
   assimilated the highest proportion of sucrose, a Mortierella isolate and
   an unidentified sterile isolate (FPC 341) assimilated the lowest
   proportion of sucrose, and remaining cultures assimilated similar and
   intermediate proportions of sucrose. On Biolog plates, low metabolic
   activity of Mortierella and FPC 341 on sucrose and R. graminis and F.
   oxysporum on maltose were qualitatively consistent with isotopic
   results. Assimilation of sucrose calculated isotopically was correlated
   with the ratio of sucrose: maltose activity calculated from Biolog
   assays (r(2) = 0.45, P = 0.0145, n = 12). Metabolic activity on Biolog
   plates for six other common soil carbohydrates were also determined:
   glucose, fructose, galactose, cellobiose, lactose, and glycogen.
   Metabolic activity was greatest overall on maltose and glucose and
   lowest on fructose. Two of the isolates (Aspergillus flavus and F.
   oxysporum) had higher metabolic activity on the glucose-containing
   disaccharide cellobiose than on glucose, strongly suggesting
   preferential uptake of cellobiose compared to glucose and suggesting the
   potential ability to use cellulose. The high metabolic activity of these
   cultures on galactose, a primary constituent of hemicellulose, also
   suggested cellulolytic capabilities. Our results indicated that stable
   isotope studies and Biolog assays may provide complementary information
   to characterize metabolic potential of fungi in forest litter and soil.

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of

   Therefore, three fungal species were cultured on Scots pine litter

   Trichoderma koningii, Penicillium glabrum and Cladosporium
   cladosporioides was directly influenced by the N content (ranging from
   1.25 to 2.19\% N) of the substrate. For all three fungal species maximum
   growth was highest at intermediate N content (1.55\%) of the substrate.
   The fungivorous collembolan Orchesella cincta reached highest asymptotic
   body mass when fed with C. cladosporioides, grown on litter medium with
   intermediate N content (1.55\%). The growth of O. cincta was lower when
   fed with C. cladosporioides from litter medium with the highest N
   content (2.19\%). Similar results were obtained in mesocosm experiments
   in which pine litter with three levels of N (I. I I 1.78 2.03\% N) was
   used as substrate for the fungi. On litter with the highest N content
   (2.03\%) hyphal length and asymptotic body mass of O. cincta were
   reduced. The results show that the N content of the substrate determines
   the growth of both fungi and fungivores, and suggest that elevated

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to analyse whether the functional diversity of

   across Central Europe, the relation between soil fungi and the abiotic
   factors as defined by Ellenberg's indicators has been evaluated. The
   palynological assessment proves that not the fungal occurrence, but the
   concentration of fungal remains is the most appropriate tool to unravel
   causal links between the belowground microflora and the soil abiotic
   factors. The analyses show a striking dichotomy within the fungal
   community. First, the logarithms of fungal diversity and hyphal density
   show close but opposite relationships with light, moisture, soil
   reaction and nitrogen availability. Second, fungal functional groups
   show parallel, decreasing trends for soil reaction and nitrogen
   availability. Aside from the mycorrhizal network as a whole (ericoid, EM

Abstract = {{Sites dominated by Kalmia angustifolia L. are often associated with slow
   decomposition of organic matter, decreased nitrogen (N) mineralization
   rates, and low black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) productivity.
   The objective of this study was to separate the effects of belowground
   competition by Kalmia from the effects of water-soluble soil phenols on
   black spruce seedlings growing under different levels of Kalmia cover. A
   factorial greenhouse bioassay was established in which black spruce
   seedlings were grown for 6 months in intact blocks of soil with three
   different levels of Kalmia cover. The soil was treated with charcoal to
   reduce the amounts of water-soluble phenols, and (or) tubes were
   inserted to exclude Kalmia roots. At low Kalmia cover, reducing the
   level of belowground competition increased seedling biomass by 134\%.
   However, reducing belowground competition did not increase seedling
   biomass at the two higher levels of Kalmia cover. It is possible that
   seedling biomass remained low because of an increased immobilization of
   N in the organic layer. Furthermore, the proportion of ectomycorrhiza
   morphotypes differed among seedlings growing under different levels of
   Kalmia cover. The effect of water-soluble phenols on seedling growth
   remains uncertain, since we observed a confounding effect of the
   charcoal treatment on soil microbial biomass and seedling response.}},

Abstract = {{Stipitate hydnoid fungi (specifically members of the genera Bankera,
   Hydnellum, Phellodon, Sarcodon) have become the focus of increasing
   conservation concern, particularly following the detection of widespread
   declines in abundance. To assess their status in Scotland, 103 field
   surveys were undertaken, including searches of 50 of the 77 native
   pinewood sites, traversing a total of 902 km. Hydnoid fungi were
   encountered on 30 of the searches (29/,,), primarily in eastern regions
   of Scotland. A maximum of 8 species was recorded on a single search, 11
   species being encountered in total. Of 22 plantation sites surveyed, 11
   were found to contain populations of hydnoid fungi. Four species were
   relatively widespread, both in native woodlands and plantations: Bankera
   fuligi-neoalba, Hydnellum peckii, Phellodon tomentosum, and Sarcodon
   imbricatits. All species tended to be associated with particular
   microsites, especially riverbanks, tracksides or areas of exposed
   mineral soil; median Values for percentage bare ground cover surrounding
   each sporome were generally above 50\%. Median values for diameter at
   breast height (dbh) of associated trees were in the ranue 20-50 cm for
   all species. Data from the field surveys were pooled with previous
   records to assess the number of hydnoid species recorded for each native
   pine woodland. When examined by regression, a positive relationship was
   recorded between the number of species and woodland area ((r)2 = 0.69, P
   <0.001, n = 50). To assess the occurrence of declines, the number of 10
   km gridsquares for each species was compared using records made pre- and
   post-1970. These data provided evidence for declines in only four of the
   17 species considered. However, 12 species are threatened with
   extinction according to the IUCN Red List criteria, owing to their
   restricted patterns of distribution. The implications of these results
   for the conservation of hydnoid fungi in Scotland are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Measurements of C-13 in fungal sporocarps are useful in assessing

   indicate the age of fungal carbon (C) and mycorrhizal fungi depend
   closely on recent photosynthate, C-14 may provide additional insight
   into possible mycorrhizal status.
   Sporocarps, needles, and litter from Woods Creek, OR, USA together with
   archived sporocarps were measured for C-14 content by accelerator mass
   spectrometry.
   Known mycorrhizal fungi resembled current-year needles (Amanita,
   Cantharellus and Gomphidius) or atmospheric CO2 (Tuber) in C-14 and
   indicated an average age of 0-2 yr for incorporated C, whereas
   saprotrophic genera (Pleurocybella , Lepiota and Hypholoma) were
   composed of C at least 10 yr old. Of genera tentatively considered
   mycorrhizal from previous work with C-13, only Otidia and Sowerbyella
   appeared mycorrhizal from C-14 measurements, whereas Aleuria, Clavulina,
   Paurocotylis and Ramaria (sensu lato) consisted of older carbon and were
   presumably saprotrophic.
   C-14 clearly separated known mycorrhizal or saprotrophic fungi and
   indicated C-13 measurements should be interpreted cautiously on species
   of unknown status. C-14 results for needles and mycorrhizal fungi
   suggested that C sources other than atmospheric CO2 may contribute small
   amounts of C. Possible sources include storage of carbohydrates and

Abstract = {{We investigated how habitat characteristics and in particular the level

   dynamics of all ectomycorrhizal fungus. The basidiomycete Hebeloma
   cylindrosporum associated with Pinus pinaster trees occurs in two
   distinct habitats within the forest dune ecosystem along the Atlantic
   coast of France. The `dune habitat' (D habitat) is characterised by
   scattered trees growing in almost pure sand at the extreme fringe of the
   forest marking the transition with the bare dune. The `forest habitat'
   (F habitat) is within tile]nature forest in places of high human
   frequentation which prevents litter and humus accumulation. We studied
   over several years (up to ten) populations of H. cylin-drosporum present
   in three geographic sites. Within each Site We Studied two areas
   corresponding each to one of the two possible habitats. In all sampled
   areas fruit bodies occurred within discrete patches of ground. Although
   all interaction between habitat and geographic site existed, habitat had
   significant effects on patch sizes and patch internal densities.
   Compared to the F habitat, patches in the D habitat were significantly
   larger and presented a lower density of fruit bodies. Patches very
   seldom occurred at the same place from one year to the next in the F
   habitat when ill most cases they were perennial and increased in size in
   the D habitat. Fruit body size, which reflects reproductive output of
   the genets, differed between the two habitats (means of the cap
   diameters of 25.6 and 40.4 mm in respectively the F and D habitats).
   Almost all patches in the F habitat were made of several annual genets
   each producing on average 1.6 fruit bodies while most patches ill the D
   habitat were dominated by one perennial genet which could Simultaneously
   produce up to 60 fruit bodies. Under-representation of small sized
   genets in the D habitat suggests a low level of sexual recruitment in
   this habitat despite the large number of fruit bodies (and therefore of
   spores) produced by each of the existing genets. We therefore suggest
   that H. cylindrosporum could be considered as a fugitive species. Genets
   of this species survive in the D habitat in which few ectomycorrhizal
   fungal competitors occur. This habitat Could represent the optimal
   habitat for this species. In the F habitat frequent recruitment could
   Occur in `empty patches' resulting from the local and transient
   elimination of competitors induced by human disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Trees allocate a large portion of gross primary production belowground
   for the production and maintenance of roots and mycorrhizae. The
   difficulty of directly measuring total belowground carbon allocation
   (TBCA) has limited our understanding of belowground carbon (C) cycling
   and the factors that control this important flux. We measured TBCA over
   4 years using a conservation of mass, C balance approach in replicate
   stands of fast growing Eucalyptus saligna Smith with different nutrition
   management and tree density treatments. We measured TBCA as surface
   carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux ({''}soil{''} respiration) minus C inputs
   from above-ground litter plus the change in C stored in roots, litter,
   and soil. We evaluated this C balance approach to measuring TBCA by
   examining (a) the variance in TBCA across replicate plots; (b)
   cumulative error associated with summing components to arrive at our
   estimates of TBCA; (c) potential sources of error in the techniques and
   assumptions; (d) the magnitude of changes in C stored in soil, litter,
   and roots compared to TBCA; and (e) the sensitivity of our measures of
   TBCA to differences in nutrient availability, tree density, and forest
   age. The C balance method gave precise estimates of TBCA and reflected
   differences in belowground allocation expected with manipulations of
   fertility and tree density. Across treatments, TBCA averaged 1.88 kg C
   m(-2) y(-1) and was 18\% higher in plots planted with 10(4) trees/ha

   not significantly so) in fertilized plots. For all treatments, TBCA
   declined linearly with stand age. The coefficient of variation (CV) for
   TBCA for replicate plots averaged 17\%. Averaged across treatments and
   years, annual changes in C stored in soil, the litter layer, and coarse
   roots (-0.01, 0.06, and 0.21 kg C m(-2) y(-1), respectively) were small
   compared with surface CO2 efflux (2.03 kg C m(-2) y(-1)), aboveground
   litterfall (0.42 kg C m(-2) y(-1)), and our estimated TBCA (1.88 kg C

   Their effect on the diversity of the decomposer mycota is so far
   unexplored.
   Sixteen Norway spruces (Picea abies) were felled and cut into 50 cm long
   bolts which were placed in four managed and four natural stands in
   southern Finland. The bolts were covered with net cages to prevent
   insect access. Half of the net cages were opened during each spring for
   3 weeks. After 28-30 months, the bolts were investigated for insect
   marks, dry weight loss, and a batch of them was taken for fungal
   isolations. The fungal isolates were first divided into morphologically
   distinguishable taxonomic genera or species and further into operational
   chemotaxonomical units (OCTUs) by their combined fatty acid and sterol
   profiles (FAST-profiles).
   The number of insect marks (holes and gnawings) found on the bolts after
   28-30 months varied from 0 to 6400/m(2) depending on the site and on
   whether the net cage was opened during spring or not. The bolts were
   attacked mainly by two bark beetle species, Trypodendron lineatum and
   Hylurgops palliatus. Boring and gnawing marks of these beetles were
   significantly more common on bolts in managed than in natural sites.
   Bolt dry weight loss correlated positively (r = 0.461, P < 0.001) with
   the number of insect marks on them.
   The fungal isolates (737) were divided into 145 OCTUs and the number of
   OCTUs per bolt varied from 1 to 12 with a mean of 8.1. The fungal
   diversity of the bolts (i.e. number of OCTUs per bolt or the
   Shannon-Wiener index) varied according to the number of H. palliatus
   gnawings, stand management and between tree individuals. The number of
   OCTUs per bolt correlated negatively with the number of H. palliatus
   marks, but even though more beetle marks were found on bolts of managed
   forest sites, the fungal diversity of the spruce bolts there was not
   lower than in natural stands. Forest management appears to increase
   fungal diversity in decaying spruce bolts but the effect is low.
   The results stress the importance of insect attacks to the decomposition
   process and fungal diversity of fresh woody debris. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Soil respiration, i.e. respiration by mycorrhizal roots and by
   heterotrophic organisms decomposing above- and below-ground litters, is
   a major component in ecosystem carbon (C) balances. For decades, the
   paradigm has been that the biomass of fine roots of trees turns over
   several times a year, which together with large inputs of above-ground
   litter leaves little room for the contribution from root respiration.
   Here, we combine the results of a recent tree girdling experiment with
   the C budget of the classic Swedish Coniferous Forest (SWECON) project,
   in which root growth and turnover were estimated to be high. We observe
   that such a high rate of root turnover requires an unlikely high C use
   efficiency for root growth, and is not consistent with the 1:1 relation
   between root: heterotrophic respiration obtained in the girdling
   experiment. Our analysis suggests that 75\% of the C allocated to roots
   is respired, while 25\% is used for growth, and hence that root growth

Abstract = {{A number of recent review articles on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal
   community diversity have highlighted the unprecedented increase in the
   number of publications on this ecologically important but neglected
   area. The general features of these species-rich, highly dynamic and
   complex communities have been comprehensively covered but one aspect
   crucial to our assessment of diversity, namely the sampling of ECM
   communities has received less attention. This is a complex issue with
   two principal components, the physical sampling strategy employed and
   the life cycle traits of the ECM fungi being examined. Combined, these
   two components provide the image that we perceive as ECM diversity. This
   contribution will focus primarily on the former of these components
   using a recent study from a pine forest in central Sweden to highlight
   some sampling problems and also to discuss some features common to ECM
   communities. The two commonly used elements of diversity, species
   richness and community evenness, present rather different problems in
   the assessment of ECM diversity. The applicability of using current
   measures of abundance (number or percentage of root tips colonised) to
   determine community evenness is discussed in relation to our lack of
   knowledge on the size of individual genets of ECM fungi. The inherent
   structure of most ECM communities, with a few common species and a large
   number of rare species, severely limits our ability to accurately assess
   species richness. A discussion of theoretical detection limits is
   included that demonstrates the importance of the sampling effort (no. of
   samples or tips) involved in assessing species richness. Species area
   abundance plots are also discussed in this context. It is suggested that
   sampling strategy (bulk samples versus multiple collections of single
   tips) may have important consequences when sampling from communities
   where root tip densities differ. Finally, the need for studies of the
   spatial distribution of ECM on roots in relation to small-scale soil
   heterogeneity and of the temporal aspects of ECM community dynamics is
   raised.}},

Abstract = {{A brief account of fungi associated with kauri (Agathis australis) in
   New Zealand is followed by an annotated listing of all fungi known to
   grow on living or dead parts of this endemic tree. Records have been
   gleaned mainly from the New Zealand Fungal Herbarium (PDD), Herbarium of
   Forest Research (NZFRI(M)), and the literature. The fungi include few
   pathogens, mainly Phytophthora spp., and few agarics, as Agathis does
   not form ectomycorrhizae. Most fungi associated with A. australis are
   saprobes found on dead and fallen wood and litter. A total of 189 named
   species of fungi and 75 species identified only to genus, distributed
   within 199 genera, have been recorded. Many of the fungi are commonly
   found on other plant substrata within New Zealand, or elsewhere.
   Nineteen species have been described with A. australis as the type
   substratum. These species are saprobes and, apart from the Australasian
   endemic, Heterobasidion araucariae, all are currently considered to be
   endemic to New Zealand. Of these, most (12 species) are restricted to A.
   australis, with only 7 species known on wood or litter of other plants.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of disturbance by recreational activities (trampling) on

   ground cover vegetation and leaf litter. Beech seedlings had lower
   biomass after disturbance. Ergosterol concentration in seedling roots,
   an indicator of mycorrhizal fungi, was lower in two of the four
   disturbed plots compared to undisturbed plots; these two disturbed sites
   had especially low litter levels. Based on ergosterol measurements,
   mycorrhizas of mature trees did not appear to be negatively affected by
   trampling. Total fine roots and SOM were higher in the disturbed than in
   the undisturbed plots at three sites. At the fourth site, fine roots and
   SOM in the disturbed areas were lower than in the undisturbed areas most
   probably due to nutrient input following picnic activities. Principal
   component analysis revealed a close correlation between SOM and fine
   roots of mature trees as well as litter and seedling biomass. Trampling
   due to recreational activities caused considerable damage to the

Abstract = {{Young pitch pine seedlings are frequently subjected to prescribed burns
   in the New Jersey pine barrens as part of the management to eliminate
   fuel load in these forests, thereby reducing the risk of wildfire. The
   bums are relatively cool and release nutrients without killing the
   vegetation. Not all nutrients mineralized are immediately available to
   the plants, however. To determine factors that may contribute to
   nutrient release and to link this to availability of nutrients to plants
   following a fire in the pine barrens, a greenhouse study was conducted.
   The experimental design was a 3 X 2 X 2 X 3 factorial with three types
   of litter, high and low watering regime, burned and unburned litter, and
   three sample dates. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (through a
   rubidium analog) uptake rates were measured using natural isotope or
   radioisotope root bioassays. Though in the short time the experiment
   ran, neither an overall burned litter nor a litter quality effect was
   seen, high watering made P less available and K more available. N and K
   were the most available immediately following application of treatments,
   whereas P was not available until after 6 weeks following treatment
   application. Net mineralization of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
   occurred in burned litter, whereas net immobilization of N and P
   occurred in highly watered, unburned litter. Since watering and timing
   were most influential in making nutrients available to seedlings
   following application of treatments in this greenhouse study, these
   factors may also be important in making nutrients available to mature
   trees in the New Jersey pine barrens. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Growing interest in possible global climate change has underlined the
   need for better information concerning the way in which carbon
   partitioning between ecosystem components is influenced by constraints
   on nutrient availability. Micro-organisms play a fundamental role in the
   cycling of carbon and nutrients in all ecosystems but the role of fungi
   in particular is pivotal in boreal forest ecosystems. Traditional models
   of nutrient cycling are based on methods and concepts developed in
   agricultural systems where microorganisms are considered primarily as
   nutrient processors providing plants with inorganic nutrients. The
   filamentous nature of fungi, their ability to translocate carbon and
   nutrients between different substrates and the capacity of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi to utilise organic nutrients have all been largely
   ignored. In this article, a new model is suggested which emphasises
   competition for organic nutrients between decomposer organisms and
   plants, with the plants depending on their associated mycorrhizal fungi
   for nutrient acquisition. Antagonistic interactions involving nutrient
   transfer between decomposer and mycorrhizal fungi are proposed as
   important pathways in nutrient cycling. Due to the nutrient conservative
   features of decomposer fungi, inorganic nutrients are considered less
   important for plant nutrition. The implications of the new nutrient
   cycling model on the carbon balance of boreal forests are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Classic ectomycorrhizal symbioses are mutualisms that involve the
   exchange of fixed carbon for mineral nutrients between plant roots and
   fungi. They are unique in the way they contain features of both intimate
   and diffuse symbioses. The degree of host specificity varies,
   particularly among the fungi. Here we examine two exceptional cases of
   specificity to see what they tell us about the advantages of
   specificity, how it is initiated, and the potential role that it plays
   in complex ecosystems. The first case involves non-photosynthetic
   epiparasitic plants, which contrary to virtually all other plants,
   exhibit high levels of specificity toward their fungal hosts. The second
   case involves suilloid fungi; this is the largest monophyletic group of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi that is essentially restricted to associations
   with a single plant family. In both cases, new symbioses are initiated
   by dormant propagules, that are stimulated to germinate by chemical cues
   from the host. This reduces the cost of wasting propagules on non-hosts.
   The advantages of specificity remain unclear in both cases, but we argue
   that increased benefit to the specialist may result from specialized
   physiological adaptations. We reexamme the idea that specialist fungi
   may help their hosts compete in complex ecosystems by reducing
   facultative epiparasitism by other plants, and suggest an alternative
   hypothesis for the observed pattern.}},

Abstract = {{The CENTURY model of soil organic matter turn-over developed by Parton
   and co-workers has been used successfully for grasslands to predict
   dynamics of C, N and other nutrients. It was tested here for
   decomposition of a range of forest litters and for N mineralisation in
   forest soils. Modifications to the CENTURY model were necessary to match
   model output to empirical findings. These modifications included: (1)
   incorporation of additional woody litter pools (i.e. fine-wood and
   coarse-wood) (2) allowing the N content of soil organic matter (SOM)
   pools to vary (3) constraining N mineralisation and immobilisation to
   the active SOM pool (4) incorporation of a small flux of mineral N to
   the resistant SOM pool (5) allowance of mycorrhizal uptake of N, and (6)
   re-formulation of temperature and moisture effects on decomposition.
   Other possible changes, such as giving greater flexibility to the
   critical N concentration for mineralisation, were tested but found not
   to improve model performance.
   The modified model largely accounted for the effects of initial lignin
   and N concentration on subsequent litter decomposition rate, litter N
   concentrations and critical N concentrations for the commencement of
   mineralisation. Consequently, the model could successfully simulate
   realistic time courses of N immobilisation and subsequent mineralisation
   for a range of litter types. The present model also successfully
   predicted the critical N concentration for N mineralisation across a
   wide range of litter samples from forests and other vegetation sources.

Abstract = {{Early establishment of white spruce (Picea glauca) in mixedwood boreal
   forest stands following fire was examined at several times-since-fire

   were assessed at two scales, tree plot (5 in x 5 in) and microsite (1 m
   x 1 m), along with presence, density and height of white spruce
   seedlings. Germination and survival of seed sown 1- and 4-years post
   fire were quantified. Survival and growth of nursery-grown seedlings,
   and mycorrhizal colonization, survival and growth of sterile seedlings,
   planted 1-year post-fire were assessed. At the tree plot scale, presence
   of white spruce seedlings 1-year post-fire could be reliably predicted
   by organic layer depth and distance to and strength of seed source. In
   contrast, none of the biotic or abiotic factors measured was strongly
   correlated with occurrence or density of white spruce seedlings 6- and
   14- years post-fire. At the microsite scale, seedling recruitment
   immediately post-fire was limited to a distinct subset of available
   microsites (greater \% cover of downed wood and moss, lower \% cover of
   litter and herbaceous vegetation). Likewise, seedling occurrence in
   older bums was associated with distinct microsite conditions; although
   this was more likely an effect of white spruce presence, rather than the
   cause. Less than 3\% of seed sown 1 yr post-fire survived to become 1 yr
   old germinants, survival was 41\% over the next three years.
   Availability of suitable regeneration microsites declines rapidly with
   time-since-fire; less than 0.3\% of seed sown 4 yrs post-fire survived
   one year. High rates of mycorrhizal colonization were found on white
   spruce seedlings planted 1-year post-fire, including early and late
   stage fungal species. Micrositc characteristics were only weakly

Abstract = {{Exotic pine plantations are promoted for their presumed capacity to
   provide a net sink of atmospheric C. Millions of hectares worldwide will
   be subjected to conversion into plantations during the next decades.
   However, pine introductions are known to result in a marked depletion of
   soil C, a phenomenon which has remained unexplained. We studied
   plantations in paramo grasslands of Ecuador, where the effect of the
   exotic introduction of radiata pines (Pinus radiata) and their
   accompanying ectomycorrhizal fungi can be studied in isolation from
   other ecosystem disturbances. We suggest that ectomycorrhizal fungi can
   extract C previously accumulated by paramo grasslands based on (a) a
   drastic simplification of the ectomycorrhizal community shown by direct
   DNA identification, (b) a loss of up to 30\% soil C within <20 years of
   plantation, (c) stable C isotope values in fungal fruitbodies which are
   closer to grassland than pi tie values, and (d) radiocarbon dating of
   fruitbodies indicating relatively old C sources for fruitbody formation.
   Species number in the ectomycorrhizal guild drops to only three fungal
   species per plantation compared to approximately 100 in comparable
   native pine stands. Our results provide evidence for a dynamic role of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi in soil C processing, and question the strategy of
   introducing pine plantations as a general solution to reduce mounting
   atmospheric CO2 levels. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nitrogen retention and recycling are topics of enduring interest in
   ecosystem ecology, yet we lack a mechanistic field-tested model of how
   these processes work in unpolluted, old-growth temperate forests.
   Forests of the Cordillera Piuchue Ecosystem Study (CPES) in southern
   Chile provide an opportunity to examine nitrogen cycling and retention
   in a forest that is virtually free of human disturbance. We applied N-15
   pool dilution and pulse-chase tracer techniques as complementary
   approaches within small plots to understand flows of inorganic nitrogen
   in the surface soil of an evergreen mixed-angio sperm forest. We also
   followed separate pulses of (NH4+)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 for two years to
   gain insights into how short-term mechanisms of inorganic nitrogen
   cycling translate into long-term patterns of ecosystem nitrogen
   retention.
   Strong consumption appears to limit losses of NH4+ and NO3- from this
   forest, and predominantly by the same mechanisms for both forms of
   nitrogen. As a result, the extent of (NH4-)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15
   retention were also similar, yet similar to 44-fold higher rates of
   gross NH4+ production leads to the dominance of NH4+ over NO3- in soil
   and stream waters. Microbial biomass played a key role in the short-term
   assimilation of N-15 tracers, but retention was only transient. Turnover
   of N-15 through microbial biomass was rapid and appeared to be only
   weakly retained in soil exchangeable pools, fine roots, and soil organic
   matter, resulting in substantial losses of N-15 from soils within weeks
   of tracer additions. Assimilation of N-15 into fine roots was a much
   larger sink (13\%) than has been reported for other forested ecosystems
   (1-3\%), and the transport of N-15 from microbial biomass to aboveground
   sinks in vegetation may explain the observed loss of N-15 from surface
   soils over time. Losses of N-15 from microbial biomass did not enter the
   extractable pool of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), suggesting that
   DON losses do not originate directly from active microbial turnover, and
   also that microbial activity may not exert as much control over
   hydrologic losses of DON as compared to losses of NH4+ and NO3- Our
   results also suggest an additional rapid and extremely transient (1 d)
   mechanism of NO3- retention via incorporation into extractable-DON.
   The long-term retention of N-15 at the whole-plot level did not differ
   significantly between (NH4-)-N-15 and 15NO3- treatments, and averaged
   65\% after two years. The lack of an appreciable change in 15N recovery
   for similar to1.5 yr following the initial assimilation, redistribution,
   and loss of N-15 suggests that the majority of N-15 was not recycled
   over the long term through inorganic. nitrogen pools and microbial
   biomass via mineralization/immobilization pathways. Instead, long-term
   retention of inorganic N-15 appeared to be dominated by rapid and
   possibly direct assimilation into a slow-turnover pool of soil organic
   matter. Elevated N-15 contents in fine-root and microbial pools for up
   to two years after N-15 additions, however, also indicated sustained
   biotic retention of inorganic nitrogen. Our results suggest very similar
   retention of NH4+ and NO3- that is dominated by rapid assimilation and
   turnover through microbial biomass in the short term (weeks), and
   transfer from microbial biomass into nitrogen-conserving plant (and to a
   lesser extent soil organic matter) pools in the long term (years). These
   processes result in efficient long-term retention of nitrogen in
   unpolluted old-growth temperate forests.}},

Abstract = {{To quantify and characterize N and C isotopic fractionation effects due
   to fungal transformation of organic substrates in forest ecosystems, we
   performed a field study in California and a meta-analysis of three
   additional studies conducted by others across the Northern Hemisphere.
   Basidiomycete fungal biomass was consistently enriched for the heavier
   isotope for C relative to substrate and either enriched or depleted for
   N relative to atmospheric N. Extent and pattern of fractionation was
   very variable, but the distinction between ectomycorrhizal and
   saprotrophic basidiomycetes was strongly supported, particularly when
   dual isotope analyses were performed. This differentiation, which we
   call the ``EM-SAP Divide{''} holds for studies within a restricted
   ecosystem, but becomes less distinct over larger geographical regions,
   removing the rationale for using direct isotopic values from single
   specimens as diagnostic of ecophysiological role. For C, the EM-SAP
   Divide seems to reflect substrate effects, potentially due to
   differential access to recently synthesized versus recycled organic
   compounds, rather than distinct physiological pathways. Once substrate
   and ecophysiological role effects are removed, our meta-analysis
   suggests the existence of more than one mechanism causing C
   fractionations in fungi which is found equally in ectomycorrhizal and
   saprotrophic fungi. Similarly, a multimodal distribution of delta N-15
   values suggests that physiological effects may play a much stronger
   influence on N natural isotopic distributions in fungi. Our
   meta-analysis provides a firm statistical base to evaluate fungal
   ecological statements based on natural isotopic distributions of C and

   measurements to make statements about trophic relationships of fungi in
   the absence of other supporting evidence.}},

Abstract = {{Very large quantities of pollen are released annually by wind-pollinated
   trees, which dominate northern forest ecosystems. Since pollen is
   enriched in both nitrogen and phosphorus, this recurrent pulse of
   deposition constitutes a significant potential source of these elements
   in what are known to be severely nutrient-limited systems. Here, we
   demonstrate for the first time? to our knowledge, that an
   ectomycorrhizal fungus, Paxillus involutus, is able to scavenge
   effectively for nitrogen and phosphorus in pollen and to return a
   significant proportion of each nutrient to its autotrophic host, Betula
   pendula. More than 75 and 96\%, respectively, of the nitrogen and
   phosphorus were removed from pollen in microcosms containing the
   mycorrhizal fungus, 29 and 25\%, respectively being transferred to the
   plants. In contrast, in microcosms without the mycorrhizal fungus only
   42 and 35\%, respectively, of nitrogen and phosphorus were lost from the
   pollen, presumably as a result of export by saprotrophs, and only 12 and
   7\%. respectively were transferred to the plants. We hypothesize that
   this process of resource recapture, by contributing significantly to the
   ability of the trees to sustain the necessary annual investment in
   pollen production, will have a major impact upon their reproductive
   capabilities and hence `fitness'.}},

Abstract = {{Gondwanan vegetation, and the Australian region in particular, is

   Distinguishing co-occurring ectomycorrhizal fungi as root associations
   in native (natural or wildlands) vegetation or plantations and
   discriminating them from other larger basidiomycetes, e.g. wood and leaf
   litter decomposer fungi, places large demands on molecular
   identification, especially if interspecific similarities and
   intraspecific variation occur in target sequences. One hundred and nine
   species of larger basidiomycetes from a single forest location were
   characterised by PCR-RFLP profiles of two genomic regions (nuclear rDNA
   ITS and mtLSU). Over one-third of the species for which multiple
   isolates were tested showed intraspecific variation in either one or
   both genomic regions. This remarkably high variation questions previous
   assumptions about intraspecific ITS sequence variation and highlights
   the value of integrated molecular and morphological databases including
   voucher specimens. It also emphasises the value of molecular
   investigations that use more than one genomic region. Interspecific
   similarities were common among the Cortinariaceae, especially in the ITS
   region. Discrimination of most Cortinariaceae species was achieved using
   variation in the mtLSU region in conjunction with the ITS. This new
   information raises the possibilities that the ITS sequence is more
   conserved and the mtLSU more variable than among species of the other 23
   families. In the other families, interspecific ITS variation was greater
   and the mtLSU profiles grouped species within families. The high
   variation in the two genomic regions indicated possible differences in
   the fungal population structure between two adjacent, differently
   managed blocks of Eucalyptus marginata forest. The significance of this
   variation to ecology, biodiversity assessment and ecosystem management
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The origins and composition of soil organic matter (SOM) are still
   largely uncertain. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are recognized as
   indirect contributors through their influence on soil aggregation, plant
   physiology, and plant community composition. Here we present evidence
   that AMF can also make large, direct contributions to SOM. Glomalin, a
   recently discovered glycoprotein produced by AMF hyphae, was detected in
   tropical soils in concentrations of over 60 mg cm(-3). Along a
   chronosequence of soils spanning ages from 300 to 4.1 Mio years, a
   pattern of glomalin concentrations is consistent with the hypothesis
   that this protein accumulates in soil. Carbon dating of glomalin
   indicated turnover at time scales of several years to decades, much
   longer than the turnover of AMF hyphae (which is assumed to be on the
   order of days to weeks). This suggests that contributions of mycorrhizae
   to soil carbon storage based on hyphal biomass in soil and roots may be
   an underestimate. The amount of C and N in glomalin represented a
   sizeable amount (ca. 4-5\%) of total soil C and N in the oldest soils.
   Our results thus indicate that microbial (fungal) carbon that is not
   derived from above- or below-ground litter can make a significant
   contribution to soil carbon and nitrogen pools and can far exceed the
   contributions of soil microbial biomass (ranging from 0.08 to 0.2\% of
   total C for the oldest soils).}},

   important tree species in the Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern

   deposition in that area. Mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal tulip-poplar
   seedlings were exposed to Al levels of 0, 50, 100, and 200 muM in sand

   significant reductions in biomass at and above 100 muM Al. Aluminum
   toxicity in non-mycorrhizal plants appears to be the result of the
   disruption of P translocation to leaves and Ca, Mg, P, Cu, and Zn uptake
   in roots. Mycorrhizal plants accumulated 2 and 1.5 times the

   isotopes were applied to pairs of wood blocks connected by mycelial
   cords, and isotope translocations were monitored during a 29-d period.
   Significant amounts of phosphorus were transported in both directions

   nutrient availability to those of high nutrient demand.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the natural abundance of N-15 in sun leaves and other
   components of tropical rain forests on altitudinal sequences of eight
   sites that form a gradient of soil N availability with varying
   ectomycorrhizal abundances on Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo. We investigated how
   soil N availability and ectomycorrhizal abundance related to the N-15
   abundance of ecosystem components. delta N-15 values (N-15 abundance
   relative to N-14) increased consistently in the following order at each
   site: sun leaves, leaf litter, fine roots and from shallower organic to
   deeper mineral soil horizons. Enrichment (3-6 parts per thousand delta
   N-15) of N-15 occurred at the litter-topsoil interface at all sites, and
   the magnitude of the enrichment correlated negatively with N-15
   depletion in the foliage, irrespective of ectomycorrhizal abundance.
   Foliar delta N-15 values significantly positively correlated with their
   N concentrations. Foliar (and litter and root) delta N-15 values
   correlated positively with NO3 availability, and negatively with NH4
   availability. The two positive correlations of foliar delta N-15 with
   foliar N and NO3 availability were inconsistent with the assumption that
   stronger nitrification (hence a greater nitrate availability) produced a
   more N-15-depleted active inorganic N pool. The isotopic fractionation
   during the passage of N through ectomycorrhizas to plants might explain
   the positive correlation of foliar delta N-15 and N concentration;
   however, this mechanism could not fully explain the correlation in our
   case because strong foliar N-15 depletions occurred at the sites that
   lacked ectomycorrhizas. Alternatively, the positive correlation across
   sites reflected the tightness of N cycling. Strong nitrification and
   associated isotopic fractionation might have occurred at N-richer sites
   and the subsequent removal of NO3 from the system could decrease
   isotopically `lighter' N at these sites.}},

Abstract = {{We used a novel digital autoradiographic technique that enabled, for the
   first time, simultaneous visualization and quantification of spatial and
   temporal changes in carbon allocation patterns in ectomycorrhizal
   mycelia. Mycorrhizal plants of Pinus sylvestris L. were grown in
   microcosms containing non-sterile peat. The time course and spatial
   distribution of carbon allocation by Fl sylvestris to mycelia of its
   mycorrhizal partners, Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr. and Suillus
   bovinus (L.): Kuntze, were quantified following C-14 pulse labeling of
   the plants. Litter patches were used to investigate the effects of
   nutrient resource quality on carbon allocation. The wood-decomposer
   fungus Phanerochaete velutina (D.C.: Pers.) Parmasto was introduced to
   evaluate competitive and territorial interactions between its mycelial
   cords and the mycelial system of S. bovinus.
   Growth of ectomycorrhizal mycelium was stimulated in the litter patches.
   Nearly 60\% of the C transferred from host plant to external mycorrhizal
   mycelium (> 2 mm from root surfaces) was allocated to mycelium in the
   patches, which comprised only 12\% of the soil area available for
   mycelial colonization. Mycelia in the litter patch most recently
   colonized by mycorrhizal mycelium received the largest investment of
   carbon, amounting to 27 to 50\% of the total C-14 in external
   mycorrhizal mycelium.
   The amount of C transfer to external mycelium of S. bovinus following
   pulse labeling was reduced from a maximum of 167 nmol in systems with no
   saprotroph to a maximum of 61 nmol in systems interacting with P.
   velutina. The C-14 content of S. bovinus mycelium reached a maximum
   24-36 h after labeling in control microcosms, but allocation did not
   reach a peak until 56 h after labeling, when S, bovinus interacted with
   mycelium of fl velutina. The mycelium of S. bovinus contained 9\% of the
   total C-14 in the plants (including mycorrhizae) at the end of the
   experiment, but this was reduced to 4\% in the presence of P. velutina.
   The results demonstrate the dynamic manner in which mycorrhizal mycelia
   deploy C when foraging for nutrients. The inhibitory effect of the
   wood-decomposer fungus P. velutina on C allocation to external
   mycorrhizal mycelium has important implications for nutrient cycling in
   forest ecosystems.}},

   Approximately 10 000 isolates were obtained, representing 292 species of
   filamentous microfungi, including 41 ascomycetes, 29 zygomycetes, and
   222 mitosporic fungi. The most commonly isolated species were

   was also correlated with the stage of decomposition. Species richness
   was highest in logs from undisturbed sites and lowest in logs from the

   Altogether, 419 species were recorded (12 parasites, 76 wood

   were no differences in fungal species-richness between plantations and

   Significant positive correlations were recorded between fungal
   species-richness and ground vegetation diversity, and between wood
   saprotroph-richness and fallen deadwood volume. Each crop species type
   had a distinctive mycota related to differences in climate, tree and
   vegetation diversity. Over-mature stands had a higher proportion of
   ``late-successional{''} mycorrhizal species than the other growth
   stages. Nineteen Red Data list fungi species were recorded; plots nearer

   These results highlight the importance of planted forests as a habitat

   increasing the area of ``old-growth{''} non-intervention reserves, and
   locating these reserves near existing semi-natural woodland fragments.

Abstract = {{In the strongly seasonal, but annually very wet, parts of the tropics,
   low-water at availability in the short dry season leads to a
   semi-deciduous forest, one which is also highly susceptible tu nutrient
   loss from leaching in the long wet season. Patterns in litterfall were
   compared between forest with low (LEM) and high (HEM) abundances of
   ectomycorrhizal trees in Korup National Park, Cameroon, over 26 months
   in 1990 92. Leaf litter was sorted into 26 abundant species which
   included six ectomycorrhizal species, and of these three were the large
   grove-forming trees Microberlinia bisulcata, Tetraberlinia bifoliolata
   and Tetraberlinia moreliana . Larger-tree species shed their leaves with
   pronounced peaks in the dry season, whereas other species had either
   weaker dependence, showed several peaks per year, or were wet-season
   shedders. Although total annual litterfall differed little between
   forest types, in the HEM forest (dominated by M. bisulcata) the
   dry-season peak was more pronounced and earlier than that in the LEM
   forest. Species differed greatly in their mean leaf litterfall nutrient
   concentrations, with an approx. twofold range for nitrogen and
   phosphorus, and 2.5-3.5-fold for potassium, magnesium and calcium. In
   the dry season, LEM and HEM litter showed similar declines in P and N
   concentration, and increases in K and Mg; some species, especially M.
   bisculcata, showed strong dry-wet season differences. The concentration
   of P (but not N) was higher in the leaf litter of ectomycorrhizal than
   nonectomycorrhizal species. Retranslocation of N and P was lower among
   the ectomycorrhizal than nonectomycorrhizal species by approx. twofold.
   It is suggested that, within ectomycorrhizal groves on this soil low in
   P, a fast decomposition rate with minimal loss of mineralized P is
   possible due to the relatively high litter P not limiting the cycle at
   this stage, combined with an efficient recapture of released P by the
   surface organic layer of ectomycorrhizas and fine roots. This points to
   a feedback between two essential controlling steps (retranslocation and
   mineralization) in a tropical rain forest ecosystem dominated bq
   ectomycorrhizal trees.}},

Abstract = {{An annotated list is provided of 906 taxa of fungi (including oomycetes

   association with the five endemic taxa of Nothofagus (southern beech),
   as ectomycorrhizal mycobionts, pathogens, or saprobes causing decay of

   specimens held in Herbarium PDD and in Herbarium NZFRI(M), and from the
   literature. Nothofagus forests are an important conservation resource,
   and a vast storehouse for New Zealand fungi; approximately 35\% of the
   known New Zealand agaric mycota are associated with Nothofagus, and 50\%
   of the known polypore species. Of the 226 named species of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi found in New Zealand beech forests (205 agarics,
   19 Aphyllophorales - clavarioid, hydnoid, etc., 1 ascomycete, 1
   mitosporic fungus), about 90\% are native, with most of these being

   Amanita(ll species), Cortinarius (57 species), Dermocybe (11 species),
   Inocybe (13 species), Russula (23 species), and Thaxterogaster (13
   species). Few pathogens have been recorded. The most conspicuous of

   growth can be caused by representatives of 10 genera of ascomycetes and
   mitosporic fungi, many of which also grow on other host plants. Large

Abstract = {{There is evidence that forest management practices influence
   soil-decomposer communities. It is also established that changes in the
   trophic structure and composition of these communities can induce
   changes in soil-nutrient dynamics, thereby affecting plant growth.
   Whether forest productivity is affected by management-induced changes
   in, e.g. soil faunal structure, is, however, yet to be shown. The aim of
   this study was (1) to determine the resolution of the ecological
   hierarchy (e.g. species, functional groups, trophic levels) at which a
   change in soil fauna would alter biotically-controlled processes in
   soils, and (2) to examine the sensitivity of soil fauna of the boreal
   forest floor to various kinds of forest management practices.
   A review of laboratory miniecosystem experiments carried out at the
   University of Jyvaskyla: is presented to examine the diversity-ecosystem
   function relationship. The response of tree growth to manipulation of
   soil-faunal composition was measured. A field experiment was conducted
   in central Finland in spruce stands, including several stand management
   treatments in addition to the untreated controls. The fellings took
   place in winter 1996, and various groups of soil animals have been
   sampled since 1995. Laboratory experiments revealed that soil processes
   and plant growth are largely insensitive to changes taking place at the
   species level of soil fauna. Some important keystone species may exist,
   but a change in the functional group architecture seems to be a
   prerequisite for altered rates in soil processes. Predators high up in
   the detrital food web had no detectable influence on any of the
   ecosystem-level processes.
   In the field, all of the faunal groups studied proved to be highly
   insensitive to the stand management practices. As compared to the
   untreated controls, numbers of enchytraeid worms, collembolans and most
   of the macroarthropods in the managed stands were not significantly
   different. It is concluded that management practices with minor impacts
   on the soil organic layer, which buffers soil biota against drastic
   changes in their environment, have little influence on
   biotically-controlled soil processes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Soil is the habitat of plant roots and the home of numerous microflora,
   including viruses, bacteria, fungi and blue-green algae, and a host of
   animals from unicellular protozoans to small vertebrates. Simple
   communities of soil organisms, present from the earliest stages of
   forest soil genesis, become more complex and grow to astronomical
   numbers in mature forest soils. Here, they are essential for the
   maintenance and productivity of these soils, which unlike agricultural
   systems, generally receive less mechanical treatments and chemical
   inputs. The soil microflora and fauna complement each other in the
   comminution of litter, mineralization of essential plant nutrients, and
   conservation of these nutrients within the soil system. Harvesting
   directly affects these processes through the reduction and
   redistribution of organic matter, compaction, changes in plant cover,
   and modification of microclimate, all of which affect the distribution,
   composition and activity of the soil biological communities. Although
   most information is available for clearcut forests, the limited data
   from other systems indicate that severity of impacts of forest
   harvesting practices generally follow the sequence: clearcuts >
   shelterwood systems > extended rotation systems. However, all practices
   generally affect soil organisms over the short term. Changes over the
   longer-term are less obvious because of gradual recovery of most
   biological components with canopy closure. Long-term impacts are more
   difficult to interpret because these are often influenced by natural
   changes in population dynamics of soil organisms with forest succession,
   drought, and the invasion of exotic species. Responses are complex, with
   various groups being affected differently. Even within a taxon,
   individual species may behave differently. Although the relationships
   among floral composition, faunal diversity and sustained soil fertility
   are not always clear, there are indications that a simplified soil
   biological system will adversely affect nutrient cycling, tree growth,
   and forest health. Decomposition rate is generally positively correlated
   with faunal biomass, and a diverse fauna is required for interacting
   with microorganisms to enhance microbial diversity. Also, feeding on
   microflora by the fauna concurrently controls certain plant pathogens.
   Destruction of mycorrhizae, essential for the establishment of
   coniferous seedlings, can lead to serious reforestation problems. It is
   therefore prudent to discourage any qualitative or quantitative changes
   in the soil biota. Concepts in `new forestry' attempt to mitigate
   against adverse affects of conventional forest harvesting practices on
   soil organisms by maintaining plant biodiversity, minimizing soil
   compaction, avoiding extreme microclimatic conditions, providing refugia
   for re-colonization by the biota, and directly introducing desirable
   microflora and fauna. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) associated with trees and shrubs
   plays a major role in the functioning of many ecosystems, from natural
   woodlands to plantations and agroforestry systems, but it is
   surprisingly difficult to quantify the amounts of N-2 fixed. Some of the
   problems involved in measuring N-2 fixation by woody perennials include:
   (a) diversity in occurrence, and large plant-to-plant variation in
   growth and nodulation status of N-2-fixing species, especially in
   natural ecosystems; (b) long-term, perennial nature of growth and the
   seasonal or year-to-year changes in patterns of N assimilation; and (c)
   logistical limitations of working with mature trees which are generally
   impossible to harvest in their entirety. The methodology which holds
   most promise to quantify the contributions of N-2 fixation to trees is
   the so-called `N-15 natural abundance' technique which exploits
   naturally occurring differences in N-15 composition between
   plant-available N sources in the soil and that of atmospheric N-2. In
   this review we discuss probable explanations for the origin of the small
   differences in N-15 abundance found in different N pools in both natural
   and man-made ecosystems and utilise previously published information and
   unpublished data to examine the potential advantages and limitations
   inherent in the application of the technique to study N-2 fixation by
   woody perennials. Calculation of the proportion of the plant N derived
   from atmospheric N-2 (\%Ndfa) using the natural abundance procedure
   requires that both the N-15 natural abundance of the N derived from BNF
   and that derived from the soil by the target N-2-fixing species be
   determined. It is then assumed that the N-15 abundance of the N-2-fixing
   species reflects the relative contributions of the N derived from these
   two sources. The N-15 abundance of the N derived from BNF (B) can vary
   with micro-symbiont, plant species/provenance and growth stage, all of
   which create considerable difficulties for its precise evaluation. If
   the \%Ndfa is large and the N-15 abundance of the N acquired from other
   sources is not several delta(15)N units higher or lower than B, then
   this can be a major source of error. Further difficulties can arise in
   determining the N-15 abundance of the N derived from soil (and plant
   litter, etc.) by the target plant as it is usually impossible to predict
   which, if any, non-N-2-fixing reference species will obtain N from the
   same N sources in the same proportions with the same temporal and
   spatial patterns as the N-2-fixing perennial. The compromise solution is
   to evaluate the N-15 abundance of a diverse range of neighbouring
   non-N-2-fixing plants and to compare these values with that of the
   N-2-fixing species and the estimate of B. Only then can it be determined
   whether the contribution of BNF to the target species can be quantified
   with any degree of confidence. This review of the literature suggests
   that while the natural abundance technique appears to provide
   quantitative measures of BNF in tree plantation and agroforestry
   systems, particular difficulties may arise which can often limit its
   application in natural ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings were grown for 3 years in the
   ground in open top chambers and exposed to two concentrations of
   atmospheric CO2 (ambient or ambient + 400 mu mol mol(-1)) without
   addition of nutrients and water. Biomass production (above-ground and
   below-ground) and allocation, as well as canopy structure and tissue
   nitrogen concentrations and contents, were examined by destructive
   harvest after 3 years. Elevated CO2 increased total biomass production
   by 55\%, reduced needle area and needle mass as indicated, respectively,
   by lower leaf area ratio and leaf mass ratio. A relatively smaller total
   needle area was produced in relation to fine roots under elevated CO2
   The proportion of dry matter in roots was increased by elevated CO2, as
   indicated by increased root-to-shoot ratio and root mass ratio. Within
   the root system, there was a significant shift in the allocation towards
   fine roots. Root litter constituted a much higher fi action of fine
   roots in trees grown in the elevated CO2 than in those grown in ambient
   CO2. Growth at elevated CO2 caused a significant decline in nitrogen
   concentration only in the needles, while nitrogen content significantly
   increased in branches and fine roots (with diameter less than 1 mm).
   There were no changes in crown structure (branch number and needle area
   distribution). Based upon measurements of growth made throughout the 3
   years, the greatest increase in biomass under elevated CO, took place
   mainly at the beginning of the experiment, when trees grown in elevated
   CO2 had higher relative growth rates than those grown under ambient CO2;
   these differences disappeared with time. Symptoms of acclimation of
   trees to growth in the elevated CO2 treatment were observed and are

Abstract = {{The species composition of macrofungal communities in 12 stands of
   planted Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies
   (L.) Karsten.) across lowland England was assessed over three
   consecutive years, and related to stand structure and site
   characteristics. Results indicate that these plantations provide a
   habitat for diverse communities of macrofungi: a total of 343 species
   were recorded, of which 171 were found to be unique to pine, and 90
   unique to spruce. The composition of these communities was found to
   differ markedly between forest areas and between plots within individual
   forests, with only three species common to all assessment plots.
   Calculation of Jaccard similarity coefficients indicated a 22-24\%
   association between chronosequence stages in the two pine sites, and
   20\% in the two spruce sites. Fungi were classified into four functional
   groups based on their mode of nutrition: wood saprotrophs, litter
   saprotrophs, mycorrhizal and parasitic species. This enabled patterns of
   diversity to be related to stand structure and a range of site factors
   (based on soil chemical analyses). Positive relationships were recorded
   between increased volume of deadwood and the number of species of wood
   saprotrophs, and also between the species richness of ectomycorrhizal
   fungi and the number of tree species present in each plot. Significant
   correlations were also recorded between the number of parasitic fungal
   species and soil pH (a positive response to increasing alkalinity), and
   between the number of litter colonizing saprotrophs and tree species
   richness. These results suggest that indicators of macrofungal
   diversity, based on relatively simple habitat assessments, could be
   developed for incorporation into forest management plans. These data
   also highlight the importance of maintaining adequate volumes of
   deadwood, and variety of tree species, permitting the development of
   diverse communities of macrofungi in forest stands; (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{1. About 10 years after establishment, plantations of Western Redcedar
   (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don) on northern Vancouver Island, British
   Columbia become nutrient deficient and chlorotic, grow slowly, and are
   susceptible to invasion by the ericaceous shrub Salal (Gaultherin
   shallon Pursh.).
   2. To test the hypothesis that delta(15)N can be related to site
   histories (site disturbance, soil N dynamics and plant development), we
   measured soil and foliar delta(15)N in the summer of 1992 in 3-year-old
   (nutrient-sufficient) and 10-year-old (nutrient-deficient) plantations
   and in old-growth stands. The foliar and soil delta(15)N values of the
   plantations and old-growth forests were different and closely reflected
   site histories. Salal invasion and nutrient deficiency interacted to
   depress the growth of Redcedar in 10-year-old plantations.
   3. Site preparation destroyed the top soil organic layers (fresh and
   decaying litter) and forced Salal (ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal) into
   the humus layer, where it was in direct competition with Redcedar,
   thereby disadvantaging arbuscular mycorrhizal/ non-mycorrhizal Redcedar
   in its nutrient acquisition during a period when N and P are severely
   limited.
   4. There was a large seasonal range of foliar delta(15)N (5.5 and 4.3
   parts per thousand for 10-year-old Redcedar and Salal, respectively),
   and there was no relationship between foliar delta(15)N and measured
   rooting depth, demonstrating that rooting depths cannot be used to
   explain foliar delta(15)N variation among coexisting woody taxa.
   5. Foliar and soil delta(15)N declined with site age and with a presumed
   change from `open' to `closed' N cycling; the N-15-depleting effects of
   mycorrhizal N transformations contributed to the observed delta(15)N
   decline.}},

   of AM fungi. Decomposition of the organic patch in the presence and
   absence of roots peaked in all treatments at day 3, as shown by the
   amounts of (CO2)-C-13 detected in the soil atmosphere. Plant N

   Plant phosphorus concentrations at the end of the experiment were
   depressed by the addition of the organic residue in the absence of

   of the vegetative mycelium of the fungus throughout the chambers as well

   seedlings grown in the plus litter (+ L) relative to those in minus
   litter (- L) systems. The yield increases were associated with gains in

Abstract = {{On the basis of the evidence that insect fungivory has the potential to
   affect fungal reproductive fitness, we investigated the effects of two
   specialist ciid beetles (Octotemnus glabriculus and Cis boleti) on the
   reproductive potential of their host fungus, Coriolus versicolor. We
   found, from field data, a negative correlation between the number of
   individuals of O. glabriculus inhabiting C. versicolor fruit bodies and
   the percentage of the fungal spore-producing surface (hymenium) that was
   functional. By contrast, the number of C. boleti inhabiting C.
   versicolor fruit bodies did not correlate with the percentage of
   functional hymenium. Experimentally, O. glabriculus and C. boleti
   reduced the reproductive potential of C. versicolor by 58\% and 30\%,
   respectively, whereas the combined trophic activity of both beetles
   caused a reduction of 64\%. This latter effect was not significantly
   different from that caused by O. glabriculus alone. These findings
   disagree with previous assertions that insect fungivory on fruit bodies
   has only neutral effects on fungal fitness. We conclude that in the
   short-term, fungivory by ciids significantly decreases the area of
   functional hymenium of C. versicolor and is likely to reduce fungal
   reproductive fitness. Within this perspective the evolution of certain
   fungal characteristics (i.e. chemical composition, consistency and
   phenology) can be interpreted as being driven by fungivory.}},

Pages = {{550-559}},
Abstract = {{The decomposition and the fate of N-15-labelled beech litter was
   monitored in a beech forest (Vosges mountains, France) over 3 years.
   Circular plots around beech trees were isolated from neighbouring tree
   roots by soil trenching. After removal of the litter layer,
   N-15-labelled litter was distributed on the soil. Samples {[}labelled
   litter, soil (0-15 cm depths], fine roots, mycorrhizal root tips,
   leaves) were collected during the subsequent vegetation periods and
   analysed for total N and N-15 concentration. Mass loss of the
   N-15-labelled litter was estimated using mass loss data from a litterbag
   experiment set up at the field site. An initial and rapid release of
   soluble N from the decomposing litter was balanced by the incorporation
   of exogenous N into the litter. Fungal N accounted fur approximately
   35\% of the N incorporation. Over 2 years, litter N was continuously
   released and rates of N and mass loss were equivalent, while litter N
   was preferentially lost during the 3rd year. Released N-15 accumulated
   essentially at the soil surface. N-15 from the decomposing litter was
   rapidly (i.e. in 6 months) detected in roots and beech leaves and its
   level increased regularly and linearly over the course of the labelling
   experiment. After 3 years, about 2\% of the original litter N had
   accumulated in the trees. 15N budgets indicated that soluble N was the
   main source for soil microbial biomass. Nitrogen accumulated in storage
   compounds was the main source of leaf N, while soil organic N was the
   main source of mycorrhizal N. Use of N-15-labelled beech litter as
   decomposing substrate allowed assessment of the fate of litter N in the
   soil and tree N pools in a beech forest on different time scales.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the sensitivity of soil microbial communities and ecosystem
   processes to variation in the vertical and horizontal structure of

   Microcosms with humus and litter layer of boreal forest floor, birch
   seedlings infected with mycorrhizal fungi, and decomposer food webs with
   differing trophic group and species composition of soil fauna were
   constructed. During the second growing period for the birch, we
   irrigated half of the microcosms with urea solution, and the other half
   with de-ionised water to create two levels of N concentration in the
   substrate. During the experiment night time respirations of the
   microcosms were measured, and the water leached through the microcosms
   was analysed for concentration of mineral N, and nematode numbers. The
   microcosms were destructively sampled after 37 weeks for plant biomass
   and N uptake, structure of soil animal and microbial community
   (indicated by PLFA profiles), and physical and chemical properties of
   the humus and litter materials. Predatory mites and nematodes had a
   negative influence on the biomass of their microbivorous and
   microbi-detritivorous prey, and microbi-detritivores affected the
   biomass and community structure of microbes (indicated by
   PLFA-analysis). Moreover, predatory mites and nematodes increased
   microbial biomass and changed the microbial community structure. The
   decomposer food web structure affected also N uptake and growth of
   plants. Microbi-detritivorous fauna had a positive effect, whereas
   predators of microbial and detritus feeding fauna exerted a negative
   influence on plant N uptake and biomass production. The impact of a
   trophic group on the microbes and plant was also strongly dependent on
   species composition within the group. Nitrogen addition magnified the
   influence of food web structure on microbial biomass and plant N uptake.
   We suggest that addition of urea-N to the soil modified the
   animal-microbe interaction by increasing microbial growth and altering
   community structure of microbes. The presence of microbi-detritivores
   and predators reduced loss of carbon from the microcosms, and the food
   web structure influenced also water holding capacity of the materials.
   The changes in plant growth, nutrient cycling, size of N and C pools,
   and in the physical properties of the soil emphasize the importance and
   diversity of indirect consequences of decomposer food web structure.}},

Abstract = {{We studied variation in forest floor thickness in four plantations of

   associated vegetation. The plantations were located (west to east) in
   the Clear Creek, Moshannon, Sproul and Tiadaghton State Forests of

   forest floor thickness is related to variation in the rate of
   decomposition. Decomposition rates were related to saprotroph abundance.
   Variation in forest floor N and phenolic concentrations, in overall
   mycorrhiza density and in the relative proportions of three common
   mycorrhiza morphotypes could not explain the variation in decomposition
   rate. The P concentrations and pH of the forest floor were significantly

Abstract = {{The main aim of this study was to test various hypotheses regarding the
   changes in delta(13)C of emitted CO2 that follow the addition of
   C-4-sucrose to the soil of a C-3-ecosystem. It forms part of an
   experimental series designed to assess whether or not the contributions
   from C-3-respiration (root and microbial) and C-4-respiration
   (microbial) to total soil respiration can be calculated from such
   changes. A series of five experiments, three on sieved (root-free)
   mor-layer material, and two in the field with intact mor-layer (and
   consequently with active roots), were performed. Both in the experiments
   on sieved mor-layer and the field experiments, we found a
   C-4-sucrose-induced increase in C-3-respiration that accounted for
   between 30\% and 40\% of the respiration increase 1 h after sucrose
   addition. When the course of C-3-, C-4- and total respiration was
   followed in sieved material over four days following addition of
   C-4-sucrose, the initially increased respiration of C-3-C was transient,
   passing within less than 24 h. In a separate pot experiment, neither
   ectomycorrhizal Pinus sylvestris L. roots nor non-mycorrhizal roots of
   this species showed respiratory changes in response to exogenous
   sucrose. No shift in the delta(13)C of the evolved CO2 after adding
   C-3-sucrose to sieved mor-layer material was found, confirming that the
   sucrose-induced increase in respiration of endogenous C was not an
   artefact of discrimination against C-13 during respiration. Furthermore,
   we conclude that the C-4-sucrose induced transient increase in
   C-3-respiration is most likely the result of accelerated turnover of C
   in the microbial biomass. Thus, neither respiration of mycorrhizal
   roots, nor processes discriminating against delta(13)C were likely
   sources of error in the field. The estimated delta(13)C of evolved soil
   CO2 in three field experiments lay between -25.2 parts per thousand and
   -23.6 parts per thousand. The study shows that we can distinguish
   between CO2 evolved from microbial mineralisation of added C-4-sucrose,
   and CO2 evolved from endogenous carbon sources (roots and microbial
   respiration).}},

Abstract = {{In the southern Appalachian mountains a subcanopy species, Rhododendron
   maximum, inhibits the establishment and survival of canopy tree
   seedlings. One of the mechanisms by which seedlings could be inhibited
   is an allelopathic effect of decomposing litter or leachate from the
   canopy of R. maximum (R.m.) on seed germination, root elongation, or
   mycorrhizal colonization. The potential for allelopathy by R.m. was
   tested with two bioassay species (lettuce and cress), with seeds from
   four native tree species, and with three ectomycorrhizal fungi.
   Inhibitory influences of throughfall, fresh litter, and decomposed
   litter (organic layer) from forest with R.m. (+R.m. sites) were compared
   to similar extractions made from forest without R.m. (-R.m. sites).
   Throughfall and leachates of the organic layer from both +R.m. and -R.m.
   sites stimulated germination of the bioassay species above that of the
   distilled water control, to a similar extent. There was an inhibitory
   effect of leachates of litter from +R.m. sites on seed germination and
   root elongation rate of both bioassay species compared with that of
   litter from -R.m. sites. Native tree seed stratified in forest floor
   material from both forest types had a slightly higher seed germination
   rate compared with the control. A 2-yr study of seed germination and
   seedling mortality of two tree species, Quercus rubra and Prunus
   serotina, in field plots showed no significant influence of litter or
   organic layer from either forest type. Incorporating R.m. leaf material
   into the growth medium in vitro depressed growth of one ectomycorrhizal
   species but did not affect two other species. Leaf material from other
   deciduous tree species depressed ectomycorrhizal growth to a similar or
   greater extent as leaf material from R.m. In conclusion, R.m. litter can
   have an allelopathic effect on seed germination and root elongation of
   bioassay species as well as some ectomycorrhizal species. However, this
   allelopathic affect is not manifest in field sites and is not likely to
   be an important cause for the inhibition of seedling survival within
   thickets of R.m.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their prominent role in global bioproductivity and because of
   their complex structure and function, forests and tree species deserve
   particular attention in studies on the likely impact of elevated
   atmospheric CO2 on terrestrial vegetation. Besides a synoptic review of
   some of the most prominent above-ground response processes, particular
   attention is given to below-ground responses of trees to elevated
   atmospheric CO2, while some feedback processes and interactions with
   Various biotic and abiotic factors are also briefly summarized. At the
   leaf level there is little evidence of the long-term loss of sensitivity
   to CO2 that was suggested by earlier experiments with tree seedlings in
   pots. Future studies on photosynthesis measurements will probably not
   alter our conclusions about acclimation, but should focus more on
   respiration under elevated CO2, which is still poorly understood. At the
   tree level, the increase in growth observed in elevated CO2 results from
   an increase in both leaf area and leaf photosynthetic rate (per unit
   leaf area). Tree growth enhancement is generally larger at high rates of
   nutrient supply; when nutrient supply rates do not meet growth rates,
   tree nutrient status declines and nutrients become limiting. In many
   studies at the canopy level, a shift in whole-tree carbon allocation
   pattern towards below-ground parts has been associated with increased
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations. At the ecosystem level, a larger amount
   of carbon being allocated below-ground could show up by either (1) more
   root growth and turnover, (2) enhanced activity of root-associated
   microorganisms, (3) larger microbial biomass pools and enhanced
   microbial activity, or (4) increased losses of soil carbon through soil
   respiration. Fine root production is generally enhanced, but it is not
   clear whether this response would persist in a forest. As elevated CO2
   stimulates biomass production, litterfall and rhizodeposition also
   increase. This increased delivery of labile organic matter to the soil
   could influence soil microbial communities and subsequent decomposition
   rates, nutrient availability and carbon storage in soil. There are,
   however, contradictory hypothesis about the direction in which nutrient
   availability will be affected. Knowledge of the response of these and
   other ecophysiological processes to elevated CO2 is the key to
   understanding the functioning of the whole forest ecosystem. Our current
   knowledge is sufficiently large with regard to how the carbon uptake
   process and individual tree growth respond under atmospheric changes,
   but more emphasis should be put in future experiments on the
   interactions between various processes, such as the carbon and nitrogen
   cycles, and on below-ground responses. (C) 1999 Annals of Botany

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{151-158}},

Abstract = {{A central tenet of biological science is that living organisms modify
   their environments. Metabiosis is a form of ecological dependence in
   which one organism or a functional group of organisms must modify the
   environment before another organism or functional group of organisms can
   live or thrive in it. Soil ecosystems are modified by metabionts to
   create habitats or supply resources for which dependent organisms may
   adapt, evolve and hence diversify. Thus, the diversity of the soil biota
   and its functional capabilities may to a large extent be the result of
   and dependent upon metabiotic activity and influences. Examples of
   metabiotic activity in soil ecosystems are: plants are the main source
   of O-2 for the soil biota; decomposers deplete soil O-2 thus enabling
   the growth of microaerophiles or anaerobes; ammonium released by
   bacterial deamination supports the growth of autotrophic
   ammonium-oxidisers; burrowing earthworms improve soil drainage and
   create aeration channels for aerobic biota; detoxification of plant
   residues by biodegraders permits proliferation of toxin-sensitive
   organisms; wood decay by microbes creates habitats for arthropods
   associated with rotting wood; arthropod comminution of litter liberates
   nutrients that facilitate microbial activity. Some metabionts, the
   panmetabionts, had a global influence by modifying the biosphere, its
   evolving biota and by maintaining its biogeochemistry. For example,
   during the development of the biosphere the cyanobacteria began the
   transformation of the atmosphere through the production of O-2 The
   accumulation of atmospheric O-2 had an overwhelming influence on the
   formation of soils, their physico-chemistry and biology, in particular
   the evolution of diverse major groups of aerobic terrestrial organisms
   (plants, fungi and animals). Many practices to improve soil fertility,
   e.g. agro-forestry, mulching, legume inoculation, minimum tillage are
   applications of metabiotic techniques, which maintain or improve soil
   biodiversity and its functional potentiality. Conversely, where
   ecosystems are degraded through human activity, e.g. forest destruction,
   irrigation with saline water, strip-mining, deep tillage, there is an
   inevitable reduction of species of animals and plants. It can also
   result in the loss of some components of the soil community, e.g.
   mycorrhizal fungi, macrobiota such as invertebrates, with a consequent
   reduction in or a loss of I:he metabiotic activities of functional
   groups of the soil biota. Types of metabiotic action include
   facilitation, ecological engineering, commensalism and keystone
   predation. Metabiosis must rank with biotic interrelationships and
   interactions, such as competition, predation or mutualism, in its
   effects upon soil communities and ecosystems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The effects of a prescribed fire on the presence of ectomycorrhizal
   fungi on the root tips of ponderosa pine were investigated one year
   after a prescribed ground fire. Ectomycorrhizas were sampled within 1
   m(2) plots before and one year after the fire, and in nearby control
   plots that were not burned. The cores were divided into litter/organic,
   upper mineral, and lower mineral layers. The total ectomycorrhizal
   biomass in the control plots did not differ between year one and rear
   two samples for any core layer, while in the fire plots the destruction
   of the litter/organic layer resulted in an eight-fold reduction in total
   ectomycorrhizal biomass. Mycorrhizal biomass in the two mineral layers
   was not significantly reduced by the fire. We used molecular tools to
   identify fungi directly from the ectomycorrhizas. In unburned plots
   members of the Russulaceae and Thelephoraceae were among the most
   frequent and abundant ectomycorrhizal types; species of most other taxa
   were rare. In the control plots these two families were among the
   dominant species in both years, but patchiness on a fine spatio-temporal
   scale caused some major changes in ranking of individual species between
   sample years. Rhizopogon subcaerulescens was the most pronounced
   example: its biomass in the control plot samples was seven times greater
   in year two than in year one because of an exceptionally large cluster
   of mycorrhizas encountered in a single core. The effect of fire on
   individual species was difficult to assess because of this patchiness
   and because all species were low in abundance after the fire. The most
   abundant pre-fire species were reduced to undetectable post-fire levels,

Abstract = {{The proposed mechanisms for the species diversity-function relationship
   in plant communities stress the recognition of functional properties of
   species, and interactions between plants and soil processes. As resource
   availability to plants is influenced by the architecture of decomposer
   food webs, it has been hypothesised that the diversity of decomposers
   can also control ecosystem processes, including primary production.
   We manipulated the complexity of soil animal communities in a
   miniecosystem experiment in which a boreal forest floor with birch
   seedlings infected with mycorrhizal fungi was created. The soil animal
   diversity ranged from zero to typical species richness of soil fauna
   (approximately 50 taxa) in coniferous forests. Between these extremes
   was a nested factorial design with manually assembled communities
   consisting of two sets of one-species, and two sets of five-species
   animal communities within Fungivorous and microbi-detritivorous trophic
   groups. To investigate the role of predators in system functioning, the
   miniecosystems with fungivorous and microbidetritivorous fauna were
   established either with or without mesostigmatid mites as top predators.
   The miniecosystems were incubated in a climate chamber with varying
   illumination and temperature regimes for 40 weeks.
   Our experiment provides evidence that primary productivity is generally
   insensitive to variation at the species level or even at the level of
   trophic groups. Although top predators generally reduced prey population
   size, no effect was found on system functioning. However; the removal of
   microbe- or detritus-feeding fauna, especially the microbi-detritivore
   Cognettia sphagnetorum reduced plant N uptake and accumulation of plant
   biomass. The functional importance of soil fauna was inversely related
   to the trophic position of the group. Our results suggest that ecosystem
   functioning is robust against species extinctions in belowground food
   webs, and that primary production is predominantly controlled by
   organisms at low trophic positions in the decomposer food web.}},

Abstract = {{The overall effects of fire on ecosystems are complex, ranging from the
   reduction or elimination of aboveground biomass to impacts on
   belowground physical, chemical and microbial mediated processes. Since a
   key component of overall ecosystem sustainability occurs belowground,
   recovery is tied to the soil's physical, chemical, and biological
   functions and processes. Depending on several fire severity measures,
   changes in belowground components can be either beneficial or
   deleterious to the entire ecosystem. Low-impact burning can promote a
   herbaoeous flora, increase plant available nutrients, and thin
   overcrowded forests, all of which can foster healthy systems. Severe
   fires can often cause changes in successional rates, alter above- and
   belowground species composition, generate volatilization of nutrients
   and ash entrainment in smoke columns, produce rapid or decreased
   mineralization rates, alter C : N ratios, and result in subsequent
   nutrient losses through accelerated erosion, leaching or
   denitrification. In addition, changes in soil hydrologic functioning,
   degradation of soil physical properties, decreases in micro- and
   macrofauna, and alterations in microbial populations and associated
   processes can occur. The direct effect of fire on belowground systems is
   a result of the burning severity, which integrates aboveground fuel
   loading (live and dead), soil moisture and subsequent soil temperatures,
   and duration of the burn. The time for recovery of belowground systems
   will not only depend on the burning intensity and its effect on key
   ecosystem processes and components, but also on the previous land-use
   practices. Thus, the impacts of fire on belowground systems can be
   highly variable and may not be predictable. Our paper is a general
   review of the effects of fire on belowground systems with emphasis
   placed on the changes in physical. biogeochemical and biological
   properties of soils and the resulting consequences these changes have
   for ecosystem sustainability. Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Soil respiration constitutes a major component of the global carbon
   cycle and is likely to be altered by climatic change. However, there is
   an incomplete understanding of the extent to which various processes
   contribute to total soil respiration, especially the contributions of
   root and rhizosphere respiration. Here, using a stable carbon isotope
   tracer, we separate thf relative contributions of root and soil
   heterotrophic respiration to total soil respiration in situ. The
   Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) facility in the Duke
   University Forest (NC) fumigates plots of an undisturbed loblolly pine
   (Pinus taeda L.) forest with CO2 that is strongly depleted in C-13. This
   labeled CO2 is found in the soil pore space through live root and
   mycorrhizal respiration and soil heterotroph respiration of labile root
   exudates. By measuring the depletion of (CO2)-C-13 in the soil system,
   we found that the rhizosphere contribution to soil CO2 reflected the
   distribution of fine roots in the soil and that late in the growing
   season roots contributed 55\% of total soil respiration at the surface,
   This estimate may represent an upper limit on the contribution of roots
   to soil respiration because high atmospheric CO2 often increases in root
   density and/or root activity in the soil.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the role of nematode predation in the functioning of detrital
   food webs assembled in microcosms. The microcosms contained defaunated
   humus and litter materials, a diverse microbial community with bacteria,
   fungi and protozoa, and a birch (Betula pendula) seedling infected with
   mycorrhizal fungi. Different levels of top-down control upon
   microbivorous nematodes were set up by assembling food webs either
   without predators, or in combinations with a specialist and a
   non-specialist predatory mite (Mesostigmata). The nematode community was
   composed of either (1) three species of bacterivorous, or (2) three
   species of fungivorous nematodes or (3) both groups together. After two
   growing periods for the birch (38 weeks), the microcosms were
   destructively sampled for animal and microbial biomasses, concentration
   of mineral N in the soil, plant biomass and plant N concentration. The
   specialist predator reduced biomasses of both bacterial- and
   fungal-feeding nematodes by more than 50\%, whereas the non-specialist
   predator weakly increased the biomass of fungivorous nematodes. Thus,
   under high predation pressure, the biomass of microbivores changed as
   predicted by trophic dynamic models assuming strong top-down control and
   uniformly behaving trophic levels. Despite this, microbial biomass was
   unaffected by the predators. However, microbial respiration increased
   slightly in the presence of predators. Assuming that microbial
   respiration correlates with microbial productivity, the increase in
   microbial respiration indicates a cascading productivity regulation. The
   composition of the microbivore community had only a minor effect on the
   outcome of the top-down control on microbes. The > 50\% reduction in
   nematode biomass and respiration coincided with < 16\% increase in
   microbial respiration and did not affect microbial biomass. Presence of
   the specialist predator slightly reduced soil NH4+ concentration in
   communities with fungivore nematodes but plant growth and N uptake
   remained unchanged. Thus, the structure of the community only weakly
   controlled nutrient mineralisation.}},

Abstract = {{Although most plant products eventually enter the below-ground subsystem
   as plant litter, relatively little is known about the effects of plant
   litter diversity or composition on ecosystem processes and no study has
   considered the responses of plant growth to these factors. We conducted
   an experiment in which humus substrate was collected from three field
   sites in the boreal forest of northern Sweden. Litter was then placed on
   the humus surface and the litter used consisted of monocultures of
   Empetrum hermaphroditum (dwarf shrub), Betula pendula (tree), and
   Pleurozium schreberi (feather moss), as well as mixtures containing all
   the possible (two-way and three-way) combinations of these species; the
   experiment was maintained in out-door conditions. Although decomposition
   rates of this surface-placed litter differed between species few effects
   of litter mixing on litter mass loss were apparent. Added litter of
   Pinus sylvestris litter broke down most slowly when placed in E.
   hermaphroditum litter but sometimes showed elevated decomposition rates
   when placed in some of the multiple species litter mixes. Soil microbial
   biomass and activity was lowest when plant litter was absent, but as
   long as plant litter was present on the humus surface the species
   composition and diversify of the litter was irrelevant. There were Few
   effects of litter treatments on growth of seedlings of either B. pendula
   or P. sylvestris,is planted into the humus. However, for one site there
   were significant effects of mixing litter of P. schreberi and E.
   hermaphroditum in reducing growth of both seedling species. Litter
   treatments generally did not alter the competitive balance between B.
   pendula and P. sylvestris is seedlings when grown together but for all
   sites litter treatments had significant effects on the overall intensity
   of competition, and mixing of litter of B. pendula and P. schreberi had
   significant non-additive effects on competition intensity for two of the
   three sites. The abundance of mycorrhizae on seedlings was only weakly
   related to litter treatment but there were some positive effects of
   litter mixing on one of the most abundant mycorrhizal morphotypes on
   both species of seedlings for one of the sites. Our results suggest that
   litter presence was important in influencing a range of above ground and
   below ground properties and processes. In some instances individual
   species effects and litter mixing effects were also important but few
   general patterns emerged, and the nature of significant effects tended
   to be idiosyncratic. Ultimately our results show that plant litter has
   important ``afterlife effects{''} which need to be considered in order

Abstract = {{Interactions between effects of insect defoliators on tree physiology
   and growth and soil nutrient and water availability are poorly
   understood, We addressed whether the western spruce budworm influences
   nutrient and water relations, ectomycorrhizae, leaf gas exchange, and
   growth of Douglas-fir seedlings under different environmental
   conditions. Four-year-old, potted seedlings were grown in two soil types
   (basalt-derived, limestone-derived) with two levels of soil moisture
   thigh, low) and were subjected to three levels of budworm defoliation
   (none, moderate, heavy) and two levels of frass and litter produced by
   budworm feeding (with, without) over 2 yr in a greenhouse environment.
   Defoliation, soil moisture, and soil type influenced allocation of
   seedling biomass to leaves, stems, and roots. The addition of frass and
   litter had no effect on any measured soil or tree characteristic.
   Interactions between defoliation and other experimental factors were not
   important except for the defoliation x soil moisture interaction where
   heavy defoliation reduced the negative effects of low soil moisture on
   seedling predawn water potential, net photosynthetic rate, and stomatal
   conductance. Heavily defoliated seedlings had less biomass, higher
   foliar concentrations of N, Ca, and Mg, less ectomycorrhizae, and higher
   net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance compared with
   nondefoliated seedlings.}},

Abstract = {{We examined whether the exposure of Quercus robur L. to elevated UV-B

   months at an outdoor facility in the UK to a 30\% elevation above the
   ambient level of erythemally weighted UV-B radiation under UV-B
   treatment arrays of fluorescent lamps filtered with cellulose diacetate,
   which transmitted both UV-B and UV-A (315-400 nm) radiation. Saplings
   were exposed to elevated UV-A alone under control arrays of lamps
   filtered with polyester and to ambient radiation under unenergised
   arrays of lamps. Abscised leaves from saplings were enclosed in 1 mm(2)
   mesh nylon bags, placed in a Quercus-Fraxinus woodland and were sampled
   at 0.11, 0.53,1.10 and 1.33 years for dry weight loss, chemical
   composition and saprotrophic fungal colonization.
   At abscission, litters from UV-A control arrays had approximate to 7.5\%
   higher lignin/nitrogen ratios than those from UV-B treatment and ambient
   arrays (P < 0.06). Dry weight loss of leaves treated with elevated UV-B

   samples from UV-B treatment arrays lost more nitrogen and phosphorus

   treatment arrays was 8\% and 6\% greater than that of litter from UV-A
   control and ambient arrays, respectively. Regression analyses indicated
   that the increased decomposition rate of UV-B treated litters was
   associated with enhanced colonization of leaves by basidiomycete fungi,
   the most active members of the soil fungal community, and that the
   frequency of these fungi was negatively associated with the initial

Abstract = {{Understanding rhizosphere processes in relation to increasing
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations is important for predicting the response
   of forest ecosystems to environmental changes, because rhizosphere
   processes are intimately linked with nutrient cycling and soil organic
   matter decomposition, both of which feedback to tree growth and soil
   carbon storage. Plants grown in elevated CO2 substantially increase C
   input to the rhizosphere. Although it is known that elevated CO2
   enhances rhizosphere respiration more than it enhances root biomass, the
   fate and function of this extra carbon input to the rhizosphere in
   response to elevated CO2 are not clear. Depending on specific plant and
   soil conditions, the increased carbon input to the rhizosphere can
   result in an increase, a decrease, or no effect on soil organic matter
   decomposition and nutrient mineralization. Three mechanisms may account
   for these inconsistent results: (1) the ``preferential substrate
   utilization{''} hypothesis; (2) the ``priming effect{''} hypothesis; and
   (3) the ``competition{''} hypothesis, i.e., competition for mineral
   nutrients between plants and soil microorganisms. A microbial growth
   model is developed that quantitatively links the increased rhizosphere
   input in response to elevated CO2 with soil organic matter
   decomposition. The model incorporates the three proposed mechanisms, and
   simulates the complexity of the rhizosphere processes. The model also
   illustrates mechanistically the interactions among nitrogen
   availability, substrate quality, and microbial dynamics when the system
   is exposed to elevated CO2.}},

Abstract = {{Many saprotrophic fungi, especially basidiomycetes, which are able to
   grow out of the substratum that they are colonizing in search of new
   resources (i.e., nonresource-unit-restricted fungi) form mycelial cords,
   which are aggregations of predominantly parallel, longitudinally aligned
   hyphae. These cords often form extensive, long-lived systems which
   interconnect discrete nutrient resources, e.g. woody litter components,
   on the floor of boreal, temperate and tropical forests, and some can
   form networks in tropical canopies. They exhibit foraging strategies
   which vary among species, and which alter depending on resource quantity
   and quality, the presence of other organisms, and microclimatic
   environment. The morphological patterns they form are well described by
   fractal geometry. Their mycelia show remarkable patterns of reallocation
   of biomass and mineral nutrients when new resources are encountered
   during mycelial foraging or when new resources are added to mature
   systems. Mycelial-cord systems encountering heterogeneously distributed
   organic substrata coordinate use of available resources so that demands
   are met by `spreading the load' through the system. The persistent
   networks, ability to forage for new resources, and ability to reallocate
   mycelial biomass and nutrients exhibited by saprotrophic cord-forming
   fungi provide a solution to the problems of life in a spatially and
   temporally heterogenous environment. Response to the heterogenous
   environ ment in which these fungi exist generates heterogeneity in

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to compare the effects on the growth of
   Eucalyptus regnans seedlings of unheated soil and soil heated to
   different extents (as indicated by soil colour-bright red or black) in
   burnt logging coupes, and to separate the effects of heating of the soil
   on direct nutrient availability and on morphotypes and effectiveness of
   ectomycorrhizae. Burnt soils were collected from three logging coupes
   burnt 2, 14 and 25 months previously and unbumt soil from adjacent
   regrowth forests.
   Compared to unburnt soil, the early seedling growth was stimulated in
   black burnt soil from all coupes (burnt 2, 14 and 25 months previously).
   Seedling growth was generally poor in red burnt soil, especially in soil
   collected 2 months after burning. However, the concentration of
   extractable P was extremely high in red burnt soil, especially in soil
   collected 2 months after burning. In black burnt soil, extractable P was
   increased in soil 2 months after burning, but not in the soils collected
   14 or 25 months after burning. However, both total P content and
   concentration in seedlings were increased in all collections of black
   burnt soil. Frequency of ectomycorrhizae was high in seedlings grown in
   all black burnt soils, but the mycorrhizal mantles were poorly developed
   in seedlings in black burnt soil collected 2 months after burning.
   Seedlings were also ectomycorrhizal in red burnt soil, except in soil
   collected 2 months after burning. Fine root inocula from seedlings grown
   in black burnt soils collected 14 and 25 months after burning
   significantly stimulated both seedling growth and P uptake compared with
   the uninoculated control, whereas the fine root inocula from the
   seedlings grown in all the other soils did not. These results suggest
   that, in black burnt soil, both direct nutritional changes and changes
   in the ectomycorrhizae may contribute to seedling growth promotion after
   regeneration burns. The generally poor seedling growth in red burnt
   soils is likely to have been due to N deficiency as the seedlings in
   these soils were yellow-green and the tissue concentrations of N were
   significantly lower than in other treatments.}},

   soil nor cause visible symptoms of decline in trees. The pH of the soil
   solution and soil leachate was increased by addition of acidified
   lakewater. An increase in the concentration of sulphate (SO42-), calcium
   (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) in soil leachate was only recorded in plots

Abstract = {{Larix kaempferi seedlings, in the process of becoming established during

   far the types, occurrence patterns and diversity of their
   ectomycorrhizas along an elevation gradient. On the basis of macro- and
   microscopic characteristics, 12 types of ectomycorrhizas were
   classified. In general, ectomycorrhizal types differed more by site than
   by seedling age. The majority of root systems of seedlings with an age
   ranging from 1 to 5 years were colonized by I or 2 types of mycorrhizal
   fungi at low and intermediate elevations, 2 or 3 types at a higher
   elevation. Under the more stressed environments of high and intermediate
   elevations, the mean D.W, of I yr old seedlings, 40\% of which were
   colonized by 3 or 4 mycorrhizal fungi, was double the weight of the same
   aged seedlings at lower elevation sites, only 10\% of which were
   colonized by 3 or 4 mycorrhizal fungi. The correspondence between the
   type and frequency of mycorrhizas, the elevation gradient and litter
   accumulation suggests that change in litter accumulation along gradient
   may influence not only mycorrhizal types and their occurrence, but also
   the diversity of mycorrhizas on one seedling. Diversity of mycorrhizas
   on the same seedling is assumed to be critical for the establishment of
   seedlings from the very beginning on stressed sites, and may also be
   influenced by the availability of nutrients. The more intensive
   competition between mycorrhizas that occurs due to a reduction in the
   food source (tip roots) shared by the mycorrhizal fungi with similar
   resource requirements, results in frequent co-occurrence of mycorrhizas
   in the same root system or even the same root tip. As a result, the
   diversity of mycorrhizal types seems to become simplified as the

Abstract = {{This paper is a review of recent experiments dealing with the role of

   uncontrolled mixture of species versus microbiota only, several known
   animal species of the same trophic group versus one species only
   (species diversity), two or more functional groups versus one only, and
   food chains with predators versus microbes and microbivores only. The
   evidence available at present suggests that taxonomic diversity and
   predation have no consistent effects on the process rates in soil, while
   adding to the `functional' or `trophic group diversity' results in a
   more predictable enhancement in mineralisation. Especially the

   example, water extracts of pine needles stimulated the growth of Suillus
   intermedius (Smith \& Thiers) Smith \& Thiers and inhibited the growth
   of Amanita rubescens Pers. Catechin and epicatechin gallate, components
   of the water extract, acted similarly to the extract. The volatile
   compounds alpha- and beta-pinene also had differential effects on the
   growth of the various species of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Our results
   suggest that forest litter chemistry has the potential differentially to
   affect the growth of ectomycorrhizal fungal species and so could affect
   the structure of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities.}},

Abstract = {{Arthropod density and species richness were determined using
   high-gradient extraction for soil on clearcut and late successional
   forests on the Olympic Peninsula, WA. Study objectives were to compare
   the effects of harvesting at different soil depths and distances from
   coarse woody debris. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to
   determine the effects of soil moisture, CO, evolution, and O and A
   horizon depth on species composition. Soil depth had a greater effect on
   changes in density than did distance to woody debris. Densities of
   Acari, as well as total species richness, were significantly higher at
   0-5 cm depths than at 5-10 cm despite significantly lower moisture
   content at the soil surface. Density of Acari and Coleoptera and species
   richness were significantly higher on forested sites than on clearcuts.
   There was a trend toward higher Collembolan density on clearcuts, but
   the difference was not significant because of the very different
   responses on dry and wet clearcuts sites. The results of CCA suggests
   moisture and O and A horizon depths were the most important quantitative
   environmental factors we measured in determining differences in species
   composition. Clearcutting appeared to have site specific-effects on wet
   and dry site locations. Low moisture and temperature extremes did not
   appear to limit microarthropod density. High rainfall accentuated by
   clearcutting was associated with lower O and A horizon depths and
   appeared to decrease Collembola and Coleoptera density on the wet
   clearcut.}},

Abstract = {{Rates of asymbiotic nitrogen fixation in woody debris, forest floor and
   mineral soils were investigated in stem-only harvested and
   wildfire-killed lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta sap. latifolia Engelm. ex
   S. Wats.) stands in the central interior of British Columbia using an
   acetylene reduction assay. The long-term contribution of those nitrogen
   fixation processes to site nitrogen economy was estimated by mass
   loadings, associated nitrogen fixation rates and decomposition models.
   Asymbiotic nitrogen fixation activity was detected in all the woody and
   litter substrates examined. There were significant differences in
   nitrogenase activities between substrates. The highest activity
   (16.10+/-4.75 nm C2H4 g(-1) day(-1)) occurred in the below-ground woody
   debris (dead roots), followed in order by stumps, advanced or medium
   decay stems, litter, humus, early decay stems and, the lowest
   (0.07+/-0.03 nm C2H4 g(-1) day(-1)), mineral soil. Because of its
   relatively high rate of nitrogen fixation, below-ground woody debris is
   thought to have an important, but largely unrecognized, ecological role
   in the long-term site productivity of lodgepole pine forests. Moisture
   was the most important factor affecting the asymbiotic nitrogen fixation
   activity in woody debris in the study area. Asymbiotic nitrogen fixation
   in the above-ground woody debris was greater on the wildfire-killed
   sites than on the harvested sites due to much higher woody debris
   loadings and longer persistence on the former sites. The dynamics and
   role of asymbiotic nitrogen fixation over pine stand development were
   presented and discussed. Replacement of nitrogen removals from
   disturbance by asymbiotic nitrogen fixation would take 180 years for
   both stem-only and wildfire-killed sites. However, this could be
   shortened while considering other sources of nitrogen fixation in the
   study area such as nitrogen-fixing shrub, Sheperdia canadensis (L) Nutt
   and mycorrhizae. Management implications of asymbiotic nitrogen fixation
   were also discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The term `biodiversity' is claimed to lack connections to a serious
   scientific background. In this work, we approached the concept of
   biodiversity from a functional point of view by asking: ``At what level
   of the ecological organization (species, trophic species/feeding guilds,
   trophic levels etc.) should reduction in biodiversity matter to bring
   about visible changes in ecosystem performance?{''} We investigate the
   concepts of `functional diversity' and `ecosystem performance' in
   relation to feeding habits (such as fungivory, detritivory etc.) of soil
   fauna and plant growth. After analysing the results of a number of
   microcosm studies, we came into the following conclusions: (i) trophic
   level diversity has clear impacts on primary production - more so when
   the number of trophic levels is low; (ii) manipulation of large
   predators at the top of the food chain had no influence on plant growth,
   whereas smaller mesostigmatid predators generally showed a negative
   impact on plant growth and nutrient uptake; (iii) declining species
   diversity alters carbon mineralization in heterotrophic systems due to
   changing interactions between trophic levels; (iv) species composition
   within a functional group can affect biomass production of plants; (v)
   inclusion of ectomycorrhizal fungi in model ecosystems may be of
   fundamental importance to understanding the most significant
   interactions between primary producers and organisms in detrital food

Abstract = {{Species richness and sporocarp density of ectomycorrhizal fungi in
   stands of Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) in The Netherlands have
   decreased during the last decades. The lowest species diversity was
   found in P. sylvestris stands situated in areas with high atmospheric
   deposition of nitrogen originating from intensive livestock industry. In
   these stands, litter and humus have accumulated into thick layers, and
   the herbaceous understory vegetation is dominated by the grass
   Deschampsia flexuosa (wavy hair grass). Earlier investigations showed
   negative correlations between the number of species of ectomycorrhizal
   fungi above ground and the depth of humus layers. Our aim was to
   investigate whether removal of lifter, humus layers, and herbaceous
   vegetation (sods)-so-called ``sod cutting{''}-increased species
   diversity above ground and sporocarp density of ectomycorrhizal fungi in
   P. sylvestris stands of different age. Therefore, three P. sylvestris
   stands of different ages (planted in 1987, 1963, and 1924) on Haplic
   Arenosol were selected. In 1990, litter, humus layers, and herbaceous
   vegetation were removed to create nutrient-poor sandy soils without
   overlying lifter and humus layers. Untreated plots served as controls.
   Surveys conducted in 1991, 1992, and 1993 indicated that sod cutting
   enhanced the species diversity and sporocarp density of ectomycorrhizal

   ectomycorrhizal nora in medium-aged and old stands of P. sylvestris

Abstract = {{In boreal forest, ground vegetation of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.)
   and feather mosses strongly suppress seed regeneration of Scots pine
   (Pinus sylvestris L.). We investigated a site preparation technique by
   steam treatment to control bilberry and moss vegetation after clear
   cutting. Sowing experiments were performed between 1993 and 1995 with
   Scots pine in four treatments: (1) untreated vegetation, (2) activated
   carbon added to the soil surface of otherwise intact ground vegetation,
   (3) steam treated vegetation, and (4) activated carbon added to the soil
   surface of steam treated vegetation. Activated carbon was added to
   adsorb possible phenolic compounds released from bilberry leaves and
   litter. Steam killed ground vegetation effectively and recolonisation of
   vascular plants and mosses was slow. Scots pine seedling establishment
   was improved by steam treatment especially when activated carbon was
   added to the soil surface. We interpret that activated carbon adsorbed
   and reduced the levels of phenolics from bilberry litter and humus,
   which otherwise may inhibit seed germination. Dry weight of four year
   old seedlings was three times higher in steam treated plots than in
   untreated plots. Seedling nutrient content was also strongly improved by
   steam treatment. We interpret the increased growth of seedlings in steam
   treated plots mainly as an effect of reduced resource competition from
   ground vegetation. Irrespective of treatment, almost all fine roots were
   colonised by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Using PCR-based molecular methods we
   were able to identify 28 taxa forming mycorrhiza on the seedlings. Steam
   treatment did not affect species richness and abundance of
   ectomycorrhizal inocculum. We conclude that steam treatment has the
   potential to be an efficient and environmentally acceptable method to
   reduce negative influence of bilberry vegetation on Scots pine seedling
   establishment and early growth. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The convergent evolution of polyphenol-rich plant communities has
   occurred on highly acidic and infertile soils throughout the world. The
   pygmy forest in coastal northern California is an example of an
   ecosystem on an extremely infertile soil that has exceptionally high
   concentrations of polyphenols. Many `negative feedbacks' have been
   identified whereby plants degrade fertile soils through production of
   polyphenol-rich litter, sequestering soil nutrients into unavailable
   form and creating unfavorable conditions for seed germination, root
   growth, and nutrient uptake. But in the context of plant-litter-soil
   interactions in ecosystems adapted to soils that are inherently acidic
   and infertile (such as the pygmy forest), there are also many `positive
   feedbacks' that result from polyphenol production. By inhibiting
   decomposition, polyphenols regulate the formation of a mor-humus litter
   layer, conserving nutrients and creating a more favorable medium for
   root growth. Polyphenols shift the dominant pathway of nitrogen cycling
   from mineral to organic forms to minimize potential N losses from the
   ecosystem and maximize litter-N recovery by mycorrhizal symbionts.
   Polyphenol complexation of Al, Mn and Fe reduce potential Al toxicity
   and P fixation in soil. Polyphenols regulate organic matter dynamics,
   leading to the accumulation of organic matter with cation exchange
   capacity to minimize leaching of nutrient cations. Humic substances
   derived from polyphenolic precursors coat rhizosphere soil surfaces,
   improving physical and chemical conditions for root growth and nutrient
   cycling. Although their long-accepted adaptive value for antiherbivore
   defense is now in doubt, polyphenol alteration of soil conditions and
   regulation of nutrient cycling illustrate how fitness can be influenced
   by the `extended' phenotype in plant-litter-soil interactions.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we show that the natural abundance of the nitrogen isotope
   15, delta(15)N, Of plants in heath tundra and at the tundra-forest
   ecocline is closely correlated with the presence and type of mycorrhizal
   association in the plant roots. A total of 56 vascular plant species, 7
   moss species, 2 lichens and 6 species of fungi from four heath and
   forest tundra sites in Greenland, Siberia and Sweden were analysed for
   delta(15)N and N concentration. Roots of vascular plants were examined
   for mycorrhizal colonization, and the soil organic matter was analysed
   for delta(15)N,N concentration and soil inorganic, dissolved organic and
   microbial N. No arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonizations were found
   although potential host plants were present in all sites. The dominant
   species were either ectomycorrhizal (ECM) or ericoid mycorrhizal (ERI).
   The delta(15)N of ECM or ERI plants was 3.5-7.7\%, lower than that of
   non-mycorrhizal (NON) species in three of the four sites. This
   corresponds to the results in our earlier study of mycorrhiza and plant
   delta(15)N which was limited to one heath and one fellfieId in N Sweden.
   Hence, our data suggest that the delta(15)N pattern: NON/AM plants > ECM
   plants greater than or equal to ERI plants is a general phenomenon in
   ecosystems with nutrient-deficient organogenic soils. In the fourth
   site, a birch forest with a lush herb/shrub understorey, the differences
   between functional groups were considerably smaller, and only the ERI
   species differed (by 1.1\%) from the NON species. Plants of all
   functional groups from this site had nearly twice the leaf N
   concentration as that found in the same species at the other three
   sites. It is likely that low inorganic N availability is a prerequisite
   for strong delta(15)N separation among functional groups. Both ECM roots
   and fruitbodies were N-15 enriched compared to leaves which suggests
   that the difference in delta(15)N between plants with different kinds of
   mycorrhiza could be due to isotopic fractionation at the fungal-plant
   interface. However, differences in delta(15)N between soil N forms
   absorbed by the plants could also contribute to the wide differences in
   plant delta(15)N found in most heath and forest tundra ecosystems. We
   hypothesize that during microbial immobilization of soil ammonium the
   microbial N pool could become N-15- depleted and the remaining,
   plant-available soil ammonium N-15-enriched. The latter could be a main
   source of N for NON/AM plants which usually have high delta(15)N. In
   contrast, amino acids and other soil organic N compounds presumably are
   N-15-depleted, similar to plant litter, and ECM and ERI plants with high
   uptake of these N forms hence have low leaf delta(15)N. Further
   indications come from the delta(15)N of mosses and lichens which was
   similar to that of ECM plants. Tundra cryptogams (and ECM and ERI
   plants) have previously been shown to have higher uptake of amino acid
   than ammonium N-, their low delta(15)N might therefore reflect the
   delta(15)N of free amino acids in the soil. The concentration of
   dissolved organic N was 3-16 times higher than that of inorganic N in
   the sites. Organic nitrogen could be an important N source for ECM and,
   in particular, ERI plants in heath and forest tundra ecosystems with low
   release rate of inorganic N from the soil organic matter.}},

   types of low and high abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) host species)
   and vertical (across profiles of litter and 0-5 cm, 10-15 cm, 25-35 cm

   in relation to edaphic parameters (pH, moisture, total carbon, total
   nitrogen and extractable-phosphorus concentration) was compared in Korup
   National Park rain forest, to test the hypothesis that the two types of
   mycorrhiza exploit different niches. No pattern was observed in either
   ECM or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fractional colonization with depth in
   the profile even though most of the variation in soil parameters was
   vertical. Only local (between monoliths within plots) horizontal
   differences were found in soil parameters. By contrast, horizontal
   differences in fractional colonization were found between forest types,
   and between monoliths, for ectomycorrhizas but only between monoliths
   for arbuscular mycorrhizas. The lack of a clear relationship between
   both horizontal and vertical distribution of ECM and AM fractional
   colonization and soil parameters suggests that both fungal groups are
   equally able to colonize the same niche, at the scale of our experiment.
   By contrast, a negative relationship was found between AM and ECM
   fractional colonization in the litter and 0-5 cm and 10-15 cm soil
   layers. This, in addition to the more heterogeneous horizontal
   distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizas in forest areas dominated by
   ectomycorrhizas and a patchy vertical distribution of the former as
   opposed to a more coherent distribution of the latter, suggests that
   both types of mycorrhizal fungi compete for the same niche. The

   explained by differences between ECM and AM hosts and fungi in their

   transformed into NO3-N, which is leached into the groundwater.
   Decomposition of deeper organic layers, such as the fragmented litter
   and humus layers, is thought to provide additional NH4-N, which explains
   the high NO3-N output. Together with a reduction in the number and
   vitality of the pine trees, there is an increase in the number of
   nitrophilous plants, such as Deschampsia flexuosa and Rumex acetosella.
   The ectomycorrhizal and litter-decaying fungi are specific, N-resistant
   species. Soil fauna are classified as common inhabitants of dry, acid,
   nutrient poor forests.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and micro-stratification of bacteria and fungi inhabiting
   the organic layers of a Scots pine forest (Pinus sylvestris L.) were
   investigated. An experiment using stratified litterbags, containing
   organic material of four degradation stages (fresh litter, litter,
   fragmented litter and humus) was performed over a period of 2.5 years.
   Dynamics and stratification of fluorescent stained bacteria and fungi,
   ratios between bacterial and fungal biomass, and relationships with
   moisture and temperature are described. Average bacterial counts in
   litter and fragmented litter were similar, i.e., approximately 5 x 10(9)
   bacteria g(-1) (dry weight) organic matter, and significantly exceeded
   those in humus. The mean bacterial biomass ranged from 0.338 to 0.252 mg
   carbon (C) g(-1) (dry weight) organic matter. Lengths of mycelia were
   significantly below the usually recorded amounts for comparable
   temperate coniferous forests. The highest average hyphal length, 53 m
   g(-1) (dry weight) organic matter, was recorded in litter and decreased
   significantly with depth. The corresponding mean fungal biomass ranged
   from 0.050 to 0.009 mg C g(-1) (dry weight). The abundance of bacteria
   and fungi was influenced by water content, that of fungi also by
   temperature. A litterbag series with freshly fallen Litter of standard
   quality, renewed bimonthly, revealed a clear seasonal pattern with
   microbial biomass peaks in winter. The mean hyphal length was 104 m
   g(-1) (dry weight) and mean number of bacteria, 2.40 x 10(9) bacteria
   g(-1) (dry weight). Comparable bacterial and fungal biomass C were found
   in the freshly fallen litter {[}0.154 and 0.132 mg C g(-1) (dry weight)
   organic material, respectively]. The ratio of bacterial-to-fungal
   biomass C increased from 1.2 in fresh litter to 28.0 in humus. The
   results indicate the existence of an environmental stress factor
   affecting the abundance of fungi in the second phase of decomposition.
   High atmospheric nitrogen deposition is discussed as a prime factor to
   explain low fungal biomass and the relatively short lengths of fungal
   hyphae in some of the forest soil layers under study.}},

Abstract = {{The present-day Rhine alluvial hardwood forest (Querco-Ulmetum minoris,
   Issler 24) in the upper Rhine valley (France/Germany) is comprised of
   three vegetation units, one still flooded by calm waters (F) and the two
   others unflooded, one for 30 years (UF30) (after the river canalisation)
   and the other for about 130 years (UF130) (after river straightening and
   embankment work in the middle nineteenth century). In the three stands,
   species composition, structure and diversity of vegetation and nutrient
   content of mature leaf, leaf litter and soil have been studied. Fungi
   (Macromycetae) were only studied in two stands (F and UF130). The
   intensity of nutrient recycling was exemplified by comparing the
   chemical composition of rainwater, flood, throughfall, mature leaf, leaf
   litter, soil and groundwater in two of these stands (F and UF30).
   The elimination of floods has caused a change in floristic composition,
   tree density and plant diversity. Tree density was higher in the two
   unflooded stands and was related to a large increase in sapling (< 6 cm
   dbh) density more than to a change of stem (> 6 cm dbh) density. Sapling
   density increased 2 times and three limes in the UF30 and the UF130
   respectively, whereas the stem density increased only 12\% in the first
   stand and decreased 29\% in the second one. The saprophytic macromycete
   communities have been supplemented with mycorrhizal species. Leaf litter
   production was slightly greater in the flooded (4.44 T ha(-1) yr(-1))
   than in the two unflooded stands (less than or equal to 3.72 T ha(-1)
   yr(-1)). Foliar N level is twice as high in the flooded stands in spite
   of an opposite soil status. P level decreased in soil and leaves with
   the duration of isolation and was at the same level in the groundwater
   in two stands (F and UF30). K, Mg and Ca contents of green leaf and leaf
   litter were high due to the geochemistry of the Rhine substrate
   (calcareous gravels and pebbles) and similar in all the stands studied,
   even though there are large inputs of these three elements by floods.
   Moreover we showed that the groundwater chemistry reflected the
   variations of nutrient inputs and thus could be a good indicator of the
   functioning of an alluvial ecosystem and of its change as a result of
   human activities. The restoration of floods in hardwood forest
   contributes to the preservation of alluvial vegetational structure and
   composition, the stimulation of biological processes and a better plant
   mineral nutrition and water supply.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancement of the atmospheric N deposition is a serious threat for the
   structure and function of ecosystems. Here we evaluate the ecological
   effects of excess N with respect to changes in vegetation and soil biota
   in a series of experiments along a N gradient across Europe. The aim of
   this project (NITREX: N saturation EXperiments) is to assess the risk of
   N saturation and the reversibility of N saturation. At the experimental
   sites with a low-to-moderate input, N was added (n = 3), while at sites
   with a high input, N was removed by means of a transparent roof (n = 4).
   The experiments started between 1989 and 1991. Across the N gradient a
   positive correlation was found between the N concentration in deposition
   or soil solution with the N concentration in the needles and in general
   a negative correlation with the base cations K and Mg. In the N-addition
   plots there was a tendency towards a decreasing nutrient status of the
   needles, whereas at one site N-removal led to an improvement. Addition
   of N hardly affected fine-root biomass production, whereas signs of
   growth increase were recorded when the input was reduced. Tree growth
   was accelerated upon input reduction at two of three sites. Manipulation
   of N input did not alter the decomposition rate, although significant

Abstract = {{The fate and effects of increased N deposition were investigated by
   experimental manipulation in a mature Norway spruce plantation at
   Klosterhede, western Denmark. The ambient N deposition was 15-20 kg
   Nha(-1)yr(-1). Addition of 35 kg Nha(-1)yr(-1) as ammonium nitrate to a
   500-m(2) plot was carried out by handspraying monthly for 4 years.
   During the first year the spray was labeled with N-15.
   Tree growth was depressed by 4 successive spring or summer droughts
   throughout the treatment years. The nitrogen concentration in needles
   increased in the third year of treatment and critical low P
   concentrations (0.6-1 mg Pg(-1)) developed possibly as a combined effect
   of drought and N stress on roots and mycorrhizae. Reduced
   retranslocation of N was indicated by increased concentration and flux
   of N in needle litterfall. Increased uptake of N was observed in all
   parts of the trees and the fraction of the input N taken up was
   increased from 32 to 43\%, whereas the fraction immobilized in the soil
   was decreased from 40 to 33\% of the input N.
   The decomposition remained unchanged, whereas the net N mineralization
   was increased 85\% over the control. The effect on net mineralization
   may have resulted from saturation of the immobilization process rather
   than from an increase in gross mineralization. Soil respiration was not
   affected, indicating that microbial activity did not respond.
   Nitrification and denitrification were not important in either control
   or treated soils.
   Soil solution chemistry responded promptly to nitrogen applications.
   Nitrate concentrations increased at all depths, and nitrate leaching
   increased from < 0.3 to 4.2 kg Nha(-1)yr(-1) by the third year. Reduced
   biological control on nitrate leaching was indicated by increased
   nitrate concentration in soil water at the end of the growing season.
   Ammonium concentrations increased down to 15 cm depth, but all ammonium
   was retained in the system. Despite the increased nitrate leaching, 92\%
   of the total inputs were retained. No changes in concentrations of other
   major ions due to the N additions were detectable. The effects of the
   successive droughts on growth and nutrient cycling caused significant
   interaction on the response to N addition. Continuation of the N
   addition treatment will be necessary to observe the full response of the
   simulated deposition increase in this forest. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

   under cloudy conditions is less than or equal to 2\%, and one
   taxonomically related light-demander (seed mass 33 mu g). Comparative
   observations were made on changing light requirement with age. The
   species varied from shrubs and treelets (Urophyllum) via small to
   medium-height trees (Ficus, Pternandra) to tall trees (Gynotroches and
   Pellacalyx). In general, the shorter species fruited in deep shade while
   the taller needed direct irradiance. All produced ripe fruit at least
   once a year.
   In 1-3\% isf seedling mortality over II months was 24\% for Urophyllum
   hirsutum and 57\% for Pternandra echinata (two strongly shade-tolerant
   species); survivors produced appreciable new stem and leaf tissue. For
   two more light-demanding species (Ficus grossularioides and F.
   fistulosa) mean lamina area was much larger in small gaps (10\% isf)
   than in the understorey (< 3\% isf), while for Urophyllum hirsutum it
   was much smaller. These three species showed the greatest difference in
   SLA. Then were few significant intraspecific differences between gaps
   and understorey in concentrations of N, P or K. In a valley where there
   was no significant difference in isf between a path and adjacent
   understorey, seedlings of species with seeds < 1 mg mean dry mass were
   five times as dense on transects along steep pathside banks as in the
   understorey 5 m upslope. The mean mid-bank slope was 66 degrees (cf. 20

   95\% upslope), and was thinner (0.8 vs 3.2 cm). The soil at 0-7 cm depth
   into the mid-bank had much lower concentrations of organic matter, total
   N and P (but not total K) and fine roots than that of upslope transects.
   All species were found to have vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza when 1-2

Abstract = {{The response of temperate forest ecosystems to elevated atmospheric CO2
   concentrations is important because these ecosystems represent a
   significant component of the global carbon cycle. Two important but not
   well understood processes which elevated CO2 may substantially alter in
   these systems are regeneration and nitrogen cycling. If elevated CO2
   leads to changes in species composition in regenerating forest
   communities then the structure and function of these ecosystems may be
   affected. In most temperate forests, nitrogen appears to be a limiting
   nutrient. If elevated CO2 leads to reductions in nitrogen cycling
   through increased sequestration of nitrogen in plant biomass or
   reductions in mineralization rates, long-term forest productivity may be
   constrained. To study these processes, we established mesocosms of
   regenerating forest communities in controlled environments maintained at
   either ambient (375 ppm) or elevated (700 ppm) CO2 concentrations.
   Mesocosms were constructed from intact monoliths of organic forest soil.
   We maintained these mesocosms for 2 years without any external inputs of
   nitrogen and allowed the plants naturally present as seeds and rhizomes
   to regenerate. We used N-15 pool dilution techniques to quantify
   nitrogen fluxes within the mesocosms at the end of the 2 years. Elevated
   atmospheric CO2 concentration significantly affected a number of plant
   and soil processes in the experimental regenerating forest mesocosms.
   These changes included increases in total plant biomass production,
   plant C/N ratios, ectomycorrhizal colonization of tree fine roots,
   changes in tree fine root architecture, and decreases in plant NH4+
   uptake rates, gross NH4+ mineralization rates, and gross NH4+
   consumption rates. In addition, there was a shift in the relative
   biomass contribution of the two dominant regenerating tree species; the
   proportion of total biomass contributed by white birch (Betula
   papyrifera) decreased and the proportion of total biomass contributed by
   yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis) increased. However, elevated CO2 had no
   significant effect on the total amount of nitrogen in plant and soil
   microbial biomass. In this study we observed a suite of effects due to
   elevated CO2, some of which could lead to increases in potential long
   term growth responses to elevated CO2, other to decreases. The reduced
   plant NH4+ uptake rates we observed are consistent with reduced NH4+
   availability due to reduced gross mineralization rates. Reduced NH4+
   mineralization rates are consistent with the increases in C/N ratios we
   observed for leaf and fine root material. Together, these data suggest
   the positive increases in plant root architectural parameters and
   mycorrhizal colonization may not be as important as the potential
   negative effects of reduced nitrogen availability through decreased
   decomposition rates in a future atmosphere with elevated CO2.}},

Abstract = {{The organic soil horizons of heathland and temperate forest ecosystems
   are characteristically rich in phenolics, which present barriers to
   organic N availability to the microflora. The abilities of
   ectomycorrhizal (ECM), ericoid mycorrhizal and wood decomposing
   saprotrophic fungi to degrade model compounds representing the insoluble
   phenolic lignin, and soluble phenolics, which provide physical and
   chemical barriers respectively to organic N availability, were compared.
   No clear relationship was found between ability to degrade lignin and
   soluble phenolics. The presumptive assays indicated that most
   mycorrhizal fungi have only low abilities to degrade these compounds
   relative to the wood decomposing fungi. In general, ericoid mycorrhizal
   fungi were capable of greater phenolic degradation than most ECM
   species, and degradative ability was associated with production of
   phenol-oxidizing enzymes. In no case was presumptive degradation of
   lignin or soluble phenolic, or production of phenol-oxidizing enzymes by
   mycorrhizal fungi as great as that of the wood decomposing fungi. in the
   case of the ericoid endophyte Hymenoscyphus ericae, phenol-oxidation was
   associated with production of an extracellular o-polyphenol oxidase
   (tyrosinase) which showed optimal activity at a pH of 5-5.5 and
   temperature of 30 degrees C. The ecological significance of the results

Abstract = {{Phenolic compounds have been identified previously as potentially
   responsible for allelopathic interferences in spruce forest at high

   soil solutions collected from the three layers of the podsolic soil: OA,
   E, and B. Leachates were characterized by high tanning capacity and by
   p-hydroxyacetophenone (found at 10(-6) M) also detected as the major
   (10(-7) M) monomeric compound in snow. At least 10 phenolic monomers,
   including vanillic, p-hydroxybenzoic, and protocatechuic acids were
   identified in capillary waters extracted from the OA layer with their

Abstract = {{Equilibrium and kinetic isotope fractionations during incomplete
   reactions result in minute differences in the ratio between the two
   stable N isotopes, N-15 and N-14, in various N pools. In ecosystems such
   variations (usually expressed in per mil {[}delta(15)N]deviations from
   the standard atmospheric N-2) depend on isotopic signatures of inputs
   and outputs, the input-output balance, N transformations and their
   specific isotope effects, and compartmentation of N within the system.
   Products along a sequence of reactions, e.g. the N mineralization-N
   uptake pathway, should, if fractionation factors were equal for the
   different reactions, become progressively depleted. However,
   fractionation factors vary. For example, because nitrification
   discriminates against N-15 in the substrate more than does N
   mineralization, NH4+ can become isotopically heavier than the organic N
   from which it is derived.
   Levels of isotopic enrichment depend dynamically on the stoichiometry of
   reactions, as well as on specific abiotic and biotic conditions. Thus,
   the delta(15)N of a specific N pool is not a constant, and delta(15)N of
   a N compound added to the system is not a conservative, unchanging
   tracer. This fact, together with analytical problems of measuring 615N
   in small and dynamic pools of N in the soil-plant system, and the
   complexity of the N cycle itself (for instance the abundance of
   reversible reactions), limit the possibilities of making inferences
   based on observations of N-15 abundance in one or a few pools of N in a
   system. Nevertheless, measurements of delta(15)N might offer the
   advantage of giving insights into the N cycle without disturbing the
   system by adding N-15 tracer.
   Such attempts require, however, that the complex factors affecting
   delta(15)N in plants be taken into account, viz. (i) the source(s) of N
   (soil, precipitation, NOx, NH3, N-2-fixation), (ii) the depth(s) in soil
   from which N is taken up, (iii) the form(s) of soil-N used (organic N,
   NH4+, NO3-), (iv) influences of mycorrhizal symbioses and fractionations
   during and after N uptake by plants, and (v) interactions between these
   factors and plant phenology. Because of this complexity, data on
   delta(15)N can only be used alone when certain requirements are met,
   e.g. when a clearly discrete N source in terms of amount and isotopic
   signature is studied. For example, it is recommended that N in
   non-N-2-fixing species should differ more than 5 parts per thousand,
   from N derived by N-2-fixation, and that several non N-2-fixing
   references are used, when data on delta(15)N are used to estimate
   N-2-fixation in poorly described ecosystems.
   As well as giving information on N source effects, delta(15)N can give
   insights into N cycle rates. For example, high levels of N deposition
   onto previously N-limited systems leads to increased nitrification,
   which produces N-15- enriched NH4+ and N-15-depleted NO3-. As many
   forest plants prefer NH4+ they become enriched in N-15 in such
   circumstances. This change in plant delta(15)N Will subsequently also
   occur in the soil surface horizon after litter-fall, and might be a
   useful indicator of N saturation, especially since there is usually an
   increase in delta(15)N With depth in soils of N-limited forests.
   Generally, interpretation of N-15 measurements requires additional
   independent data and modelling, and benefits from a controlled
   experimental setting. Modelling will be greatly assisted by the
   development of methods to measure the delta(15)N of small dynamic pools
   of N in soils. Direct comparisons with parallel low tracer level N-15
   studies will be necessary to further develop the interpretation of
   variations in delta(15)N in soil-plant systems. Another promising
   approach is to study ratios of N-15:N-14 together with other pairs of
   stable isotopes, e.g. C-13:C-12 or O-18:O-16, in the same ion or
   molecules. This approach can help to tackle the challenge of
   distinguishing isotopic source effects from fractionations within the
   system studied.}},

Abstract = {{In the southern part of Korup National Park, Cameroon, nine replicate
   plots (40 x 80 m) in forest with low abundances (5-15\% of the basal
   area of all trees greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh {[}girth at breast
   height]; LEM) and nine with high abundances (45-68\%; HEM) of
   ectomycorrhizal caesalpiniaceous legumes were selected from an earlier
   enumeration along an east-west 5-km transect. The codominant caesalps in
   HEM plots were Microberlinia bisulcata, Tetraberlinia bifoliolata, and
   T. moreliana, and ordination showed the LEM and HEM plots to be
   floristically distinct. The HEM plots lay in a large well-defined patch
   of these caesalps, set within surrounding LEM forest. A further contrast
   to HEM forest was achieved by selecting six LEM and six VLEM plots (very
   low, approximate to 0\% ectomycorrhizal trees) on a second transect 12
   km to the north. Korup has an annual rainfall of 5180 mm with one very
   distinct 3-mo dry season (December-February). The soils are sandy,
   acidic, and very phosphorus poor. The aim was to determine whether LEM
   and HEM plots differed in their litter and soil phosphorus status and
   the characteristics of their phosphorus cycles.
   On 13 occasions between August 1988 and September 1990, litter and soils
   in the surface root layer and the mineral layer 5 cm below were sampled
   on the main transect and analyzed for phosphorus fractions. This
   analysis distinguished between inorganic and organic forms and provided
   various measures of lability. Nitrogen and carbon contents, pH, and
   moisture contents of each layer, depth of the root layer, and amounts of
   litter (i.e., litter mass) and soil were the other main variables. In a
   subset of plots, leaf litterfall was collected over the period and
   analyzed for phosphorus and nitrogen, and two litter-bag experiments in
   early wet seasons estimated rates of litter disappearance. Root biomass
   and change with depth were estimated from pit samples within the plots.
   HEM plots had slightly higher mean basal area of trees than LEM plots
   (32.3 and 27.1 m(2)/ha, respectively) and higher fine root (less than or
   equal to 5 mm diameter) biomasses (519 and 364 g/m(2), 0-5 cm), but the
   same mean litter mass (155 g/m(2)) and annual leaf litterfall (720
   g/m(2)) and very similar disappearance rates (1.82 g.m(-2).d(-1) on
   litterfall/mass basis; t(1/2) of 53 d from litter bags). Litter mass
   (and litterfall) reached a clear peak in the mid-dry season in both HEM
   and LEM plots (slightly earlier in HEM), almost completely disappearing
   by mid-wet season. The phosphorus concentrations in HEM falling leaf
   litter was much greater than in LEM (801 and 676 mu g/g) leading to
   greater inputs (1.79 and 1.35 mg.m(-2).d(-1)), while for nitrogen the
   concentrations and inputs were very similar (means 17.8 mg/g, 35.3
   mg.m(-2).d(-1)). An important feature was the marked peak in phosphorus
   (but not nitrogen) concentration in litter in the HEM plots only in
   those years that did not follow a mast fruiting.
   Depth of the root layer was greater in the HEM than LEM plots (8.1 and
   4.2 mm), as was carbon content (5.5 and 4.0\%), but bulk density was
   less (0.85 and 1.30 g/cm(3)). Moisture contents, which tracked the
   seasons in all three layers, were slightly higher in HEM than LEM, as
   were clay and silt contents, but pH values were lower (4.19 and 4.59,
   root layer). The relative differences in the eight soil phosphorus
   fractions (resin-, bicarbonate- and NaOH-extractable, and
   chloroform-labile, inorganic, and organic) plus residual and total
   phosphorus were remarkably consistent between HEM and LEM plots. In the
   root layer total phosphorus was much higher in HEM than LEM plots (309
   and 186 mu g/g, respectively) and likewise in the mineral layer (192 and
   119 mu g/g, respectively): HEM/LEM ratios of approximate to 1.6 were
   maintained across nearly all fractions. Covariance analysis indicated
   that the basal areas of LEM and HEM plots could not account for the
   differences in phosphorus concentrations.
   Different fractions followed different trends with time, but these did
   not match seasons and showed, for the more labile inorganic phosphorus
   fractions especially, a linear decline over the study period.
   Interactions between forest type and date (split-plot repeated-measures
   analysis of variance) were rarely significant even though date itself
   invariably was. In marked contrast, nitrogen fractions did not decline,
   and labile organic nitrogen showed clear seasonal peaks. Differences
   between the LEM forest on the two transects (two occasions in common)
   were small and inconsistent, supporting the wider contrast. with HEM
   plots. Principal components analysis of the phosphorus and nitrogen
   fractions showed a strong discrimination between LEM and HEM plots.
   Calculation with amounts of phosphorus in the top 6 cm of the soil
   showed very similar patterns to the concentrations.
   Large ectomycorrhizal trees appeared to have increased the depth of the
   surface root layer, its phosphorus content, the labile phosphorus
   fraction (notably its organic component), and to have enhanced
   phosphorus cycling. The role of ectomycorrhizas in this process is
   discussed. The decline in labile phosphorus is explained by a
   phenological and climatic ectomycorrhizal response (PACER) hypothesis
   that highlights the relationship between phosphorus demand in mast
   fruiting years and soil phosphorus concentrations. The importance of
   this in adaptations by ectomycorrhizal caesalps to this strongly
   seasonal and phosphorus-poor site is considered.}},

   all three soils. Compared to birch and spruce seedlings, the growth of
   Kalmia resulted in significantly higher gross N mineralization rates,

Abstract = {{This study investigated simultaneous plant and soil feedbacks on growth
   enhancement with elevated {[}CO2] within microcosms of yellow birch
   (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) in the second year of growth.
   Understanding the integrated responses of model ecosystems may provide
   key insight into the potential net nutrient feedbacks on {[}CO2] growth
   enhancements in temperate forests. We measured the net biomass
   production, C:N ratios, root architecture, and mycorrhizal responses of
   yellow birch, in situ rates gross nitrogen mineralization and the
   partitioning of available NH4+ between yellow birch and soil microbes.
   Elevated atmospheric {[}CO2] resulted in significant alterations in the
   cycling of N within the microcosms. Plant C/N ratios were significantly
   increased, gross mineralization and NH4+ consumption rates were
   decreased, and relative microbial uptake of NH4+ was increased,
   representing a suite of N cycling negative feedbacks on N availability.
   However, increased C/N ratios may also be a mechanism which allows
   plants to maintain higher growth with a constant or reduced N supply.
   Total plant N content was increased with elevated {[}CO2], suggesting
   that yellow birch had successfully increased their ability to acquire
   nutrients during the first year of growth. However, plant uptake rates
   of NH4+ had decreased in the second year. This discrepancy implies that,
   in this study, nitrogen uptake skewed a trend through ontogeny of
   decreasing enhancement under elevated {[}CO2]. The reduced N
   mineralization and relatively increased N immobilization are a potential
   feedback which may drive this ontogenetic trend. This study has
   demonstrated the importance of using an integrated approach to exploring

Abstract = {{Naturally thermotolerant vegetation in New Zealand is concentrated in
   approximately 39 geothermally heated areas totalling only 580 ha
   scattered along the 300 km length of the Taupo Volcanic Zone.
   Relationships between composition and structure of vegetation and
   environment were analysed at the comparatively large (95 ha) and
   unmodified Te Kopia geothermal steamfield. Vascular vegetation was
   mostly influenced by a strong gradient in soil temperature, ranging at
   15 cm depth from 15 degrees C to 90 degrees C across the steamfield.
   Dominant species changed from evergreen, broadleaved forest at the cool
   end of this gradient to dominance on increasingly hot soils by
   myrtaceous and epacrid (southern heath) shrubs with small needle-like
   leaves and shallow roots. While differences in cryptogam composition
   were mostly associated with spatial variation in soil temperature, they
   were also significantly influenced by soil acidity and Al concentration.
   All soils sampled along the gradient had low fertility, high acidity,
   and high levels of Al, SO4, and Fe. This suggests that vegetation
   considered to be geothermally influenced should include relatively tall
   forest and scrub further from fumarole centres than has previously been
   recognised.
   Plants of geothermal areas tolerate acid soils with levels of Al that
   normally would be toxic. Mycorrhizal relationships may play important
   roles in plant survivorship in this environment by assisting nutrient
   acquisition. In common with the changes in community characteristics
   typical of other steep gradients of increasing stress, as soil
   temperatures increase so canopy height, plant stature, species richness,
   leaf size, and rooting depth decrease. These distinctive ecosystems
   provide excellent opportunities for research on plant community response

Abstract = {{This study examined select, naturally-occurring tree mycorrhizae for

   root respiration in field-collected ectomycorrhizae of American beech
   and gray birch and VAM of red maple. Root materials were collected in
   the early and late growing season from a common soil type. American
   beech occurred in a late-successional stand, whereas gray birch and red
   maple grew in a mid-successional stand. All of the root types examined
   had phosphatase activities with p-nitrophenyl phosphate,
   bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate and phytic acid and thus the potential to
   mineralize monoester and diester forms of organic phosphorus. Rates of
   hydrolysis at pH 5.0 were greatest with p-nitrophenyl phosphate.
   Although enzyme activity varied with season and ectomycorrhizal
   morphotype, VAM roots of red maple consistently had the lowest enzyme
   activities on a length and dry weight basis. Comparison of P-32 uptake
   from inositol phosphate by gray birch and red maple roots suggested that

Abstract = {{In northern boreal forests ground level species occur which may have the
   capacity to suppress tree seedling regeneration substantially,
   particularly in late successional stages. We investigated, through an
   experiment involving sequential manipulations, the effects of three
   biotic components operating at the ground layer, i.e. above-ground
   effects of the ericaceous shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum and of the
   feather-moss species Pleurozium schreberi and the below-ground effects
   of extramatrical mycorrhizal hyphae, on the seedling establishment,
   growth and nutrient acquisition of Pinus sylvestris during two growing
   seasons. Germination and seedling establishment of P. sylvestris were
   enhanced by reduction of the above ground components of E.
   hermaphroditum and P. schreberi but were not influenced by temporary
   disruption of mycorrhizal hyphae. Seedling growth and nitrogen content
   were, however, signifi cantly increased when hyphal connections were
   disrupted and above ground influence of P. schreberi and E.
   hermaphroditum were reduced. Higher shoot:root ratios were also found in
   seedlings when hyphal connections were disrupted. Seedlings in
   treatments where P. schreberi was left intact and above ground
   interference by E. hermaphroditum was reduced had unusually low
   shoot:root ratios (1.6) after two growing seasons and significantly
   lower total amounts of nutrients after one growing season than were
   initially present in the seeds, indicative of a net nutrient drain
   during the early establishment phase. The experiment could not explain
   the mechanisms behind this unexpected nutrient drain. Possible
   rhizosphere interactions immobilizing nutrients and causing seedling
   nutrient losses are discussed. From the results of this study and other
   indirect evidence we hypothesize that the three biotic components we
   investigated could act together to immobilize nutrients and to inhibit
   tree seedling regeneration and growth in late successional stages of
   boreal forests.}},

Abstract = {{A sound understanding of nutrient dynamics in ecosystems is required in
   order to manage these systems on a sustainable basis. A valuable
   approach to studying phosphorus (P) dynamics in soil-plant systems has

   brief discussion of the properties of P isotopes and their measurements
   is included together with techniques for measuring exchangeable P in the
   soil, dissolution and decomposition rates of inorganic and organic P
   sources applied to the soil, rates of organic P immobilization and
   mineralization, rates of P release and retention in the soil, root
   activity and litter decomposition rates in forest soils, and gene
   probing and hybridization. Basic principles, assumptions, procedures,

Abstract = {{In the vegetation periods of 1994 and 1995, fungus-colonized soil
   samples from around the base of fruit bodies of basidiomycete fungi were
   excised. They were collected from fairy rings on grass-and woodlands and
   from stands of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Control samples devoid of
   conspicuous mycelia originated from adjacent plots with a comparable
   vegetation and soil structure. Water extraction and spectrophotometric
   analysis of fungus-colonized samples indicated the presence of several
   cell-free polyphenol oxidases, peroxidases, manganese peroxidases,
   hydroxylases, aromatic-ring cleavage dioxygenases, and esterases as well
   as active oxygen species. Tests for ligninolytic activity were in part
   positive. The activities of enzymes involved in the catalysis of H2O2,
   the essential co-substrate of ligninolytic peroxidases, were also
   detected. Unvegetated control soils contained occasional traces of free
   polyphenol oxidases and peroxidases. Vegetated control samples were
   dominated by the activity of guaiacol peroxidase, which is known to be
   linked with plant tissue. It is concluded that basidiomycetous mycelia
   grown in the field are associated with the activities of enzymes which
   directly catalyze the degradation of lignin, some humic material in
   soil, and aromatic xenobiotics by hydroxylation, oxidation, and cleavage
   of aromatic ring structures. Further enzymes detected by their
   activities may be indirectly involved in these degradation processes by
   forming highly reactive substrate radicals, active oxygen species, and
   higher-valency metal ions with considerable oxidative capacity.}},

Abstract = {{N-15 natural abundances of soil total N, roots and mycorrhizas were
   studied in surface soil profiles in coniferous and broadleaved forests
   along a transect from central to northern Europe. Under conditions of N
   limitation in Sweden, there was an increase in delta(15)N of soil total
   N of up to 9 parts per thousand from the uppermost horizon of the
   organic mor layer down to the upper 0-5 cm of the mineral soil. The
   delta(15)N of roots was only slightly lower than that of soil total N in
   the upper organic horizon, but further down roots were up to 5 parts per
   thousand depleted under such conditions. In experimentally N-enriched
   forest in Sweden, i.e. in plots which have received an average of c. 100
   kg N ha(-1) year(-1) for 20 years and which retain less than 50\% of
   this added N in the stand and the soil down to 20 cm depth, and in some
   forests in central Europe, the increase in delta(15)N with depth in soil
   total N was smaller. An increase in delta(15)N of the surface soil was
   even observed on experimentally N-enriched plots, although other data
   suggest that the N fertilizer added was depleted in N-15. In such cases
   roots could be enriched in N-15 relative to soil total N, suggesting
   that labelling of the surf ace soil is via the pathway: - available
   pools of N plant N - litter N. Under N-limiting conditions roots of
   different species sampled from the same soil horizon showed similar
   delta(15)N. By contrast, in experimentally N-enriched forest delta(15)N
   of roots increased in the sequence: ericaceous dwarf shrubs<Scots
   pine<grass, suggesting increasing use of inorganic N along the sequence.
   Complementary studies at the major transect sites had shown that 90-99\%
   of fine tree roots had ectomycorrhizas (ECMs). ECMs were 2 parts per
   thousand more enriched than corresponding non-mycorrhizal fine roots.
   Fungal stripped off ECMs were 2.4-6.4 parts per thousand enriched
   relative to the remaining root core. It is suggested that a flux of N
   through ECMs to aboveground pasts in N-limited forests would leave N-15
   enriched compounds in fungal material, which could contribute to explain
   the observed delta(15)N profiles if fungal material is enriched, because
   it is a precursor of stable organic matter and recalcitrant N. This
   could act in addition to the previous explanation of the isotopically
   lighter soil surface in forests: plant uptake of N-15-depleted N and its
   redeposition onto the soil surface by litter-fall.}},

   activities of cellulase, beta-xylosidase, beta-glucosidase and
   polyphenol oxidase were investigated as indicators of the decomposition
   capacity of the fungi in the litter. Low activities of all enzymes
   tested were found in the uncolonized beech leaves. Phosphomonoesterase

Abstract = {{Fine root production and turnover were studied in hardwood and
   coniferous taiga forests using three methods. (1) Using soil cores, fine
   root production ranged from 1574 +/- 76 kg . ha(-1). year(-1) in the
   upland white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) stand to 4386 +/- 322
   kg . ha(-1). year(-1) in the floodplain balsam poplar (Populus
   balsamifera L.) stand, accounting for 49\% of total production for
   coniferous stands and 32\% of total production for deciduous stands.
   Fine root turnover rates were higher in floodplain (0.90 +/- 0.06
   year(-1)) stands than in upland (0.42 +/- 0.10 year(-1)) stands. Across
   all sites, the ratio of fine root turnover to litter fall averaged 2.2
   for biomass and 2.8 for N. Both values were higher in floodplain stands
   than in upland stands, and in coniferous stands than in deciduous
   stands. (2) The C budget method showed that C allocation to fine roots
   varied from 150 to 425 g C . m(-2). year(-1) and suggested that soil
   respiration was more dependent on C derived from roots than from
   aboveground inputs. The C allocation ratio (C to roots : C to litter
   fall) was inversely correlated with litter-fall C and varied from 0.3 to
   69.5; there was a tendency for higher proportional belowground
   allocation in coniferous stands than in deciduous stands and the highest
   levels were at the earliest successional sites. (3) Estimates of
   apparent N uptake (N-u), N allocation to fine roots, and fine root
   production based on N budget calculations showed that annual aboveground
   N increments exceeded N-u estimates at half the sites, indicating that
   the method failed to account for large amounts of N acquired by plants.
   This suggests that plant and (or) mycorrhizal uptake of soil organic N
   may be more significant to ecosystem N cycling than mineral N turnover
   by the soil microbial biomass.}},

   and soil temperature and moisture contents. Western hemlock logs
   respired at a significantly higher rate (4.05 g CO(2)m(-2). day(-1))
   than Douglas-fir logs (2.94 g CO(2)m(-2). day(-1)). There were no
   significant differences between respiration rates for decay classes 1-2,
   3, and 5 logs (4.47, 3.69, and 4.28 g CO(2)m(-2). day(-1),
   respectively), and there was no strong relationship between CWD
   respiration rate and log diameter. The highest average respiration rate
   was from the soil in the clearcut (5.22 g CO2 . m(-2). day(-1)).
   Averaged for the year, log and soil respiration rates in the clearcut
   site were similar to those in an adjacent old-growth forested site.
   However, seasonal fluctuations were greater on the clearcut site. Higher
   summer respiration rates and lower winter rates observed on the clearcut
   relative to the old-growth site appeared to be driven more by
   temperature than by moisture. Clear-cutting also resulted in higher
   summer CWD and soil temperatures and lower winter temperatures compared
   with the old-growth site.}},

Abstract = {{The growth rate of Eucalyptus regnans seedlings in their first year can
   be much increased if the soil is first dried and then rewetted. The
   ratio of growth on predried soil to growth on undried soil (the Growth
   Ratio or GR) reaches a maximum at air-dryness (pF 6.0 - 6.4). In E.
   regnans forest soil, GR is greatest in humus-rich topsoil and declines
   with depth. The effect of air-drying persists for several months after
   rewetting when soil is stored under glasshouse conditions. It is largely
   unaffected by repeated drying and wetting, by the rate of drying or by
   the season of collection. The mixing of dried and undried soil or the
   placement of a layer of dried soil above undried soil produces an
   enhancement of growth proportional to the amount of dried soil added.
   Firing of a litter layer above soil at wilting point increases
   subsequent seedling growth to that in air-dried soil. The addition of
   ash from a litter fire to undried soil produces an increase in growth
   approximately equal to that caused by air-drying
   The drying effect is most pronounced in soils from mature E. regnans
   forest and nearby brackenland and is less in dense younger forest,
   frost-hollow grasslands and old grassy gaps in the mature forest. The
   effect is restored by the inoculation of E. regnans mycorrhizal roots
   from both dried and undried soil. The effect varies along an gradient
   from 500 to 1500 m a.s.l. and is a maximum in the wet E. regnans
   climatic zone and a minimum in zones or local aspects where forests are
   normally subject to frequent drying. The stimulatory effect on seedling
   growth in soils of the E. regnans zone may have an effect on the outcome
   of competition during regeneration in large gaps. Part of the growth
   responses previously ascribed to the `ash-bed' effect may be due to the
   desiccation effect in these soils.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that roots enhance soil-N turnover in humified soil
   organic matter (SOM) (mull) but not in lignified SOM (mor) was tested in
   a study involving the growth of eight species of tree seedlings on the
   two contrasting humus forms. After 12 and 22 weeks of seedling growth,
   soil-CO2 efflux was measured with (1) growing seedlings, and after 22
   weeks, with (2) roots only, shoots excised, and (3) with roots removed
   and soils amended with different rates of glucose. Indices of C-flux and
   of soil available-C were derived and compared to plant-N uptake,
   extractable soil mineral-N, anaerobically mineralized soil-N, N
   bioavailability to Agrostis grass following harvest of seedlings, and to
   seedling fine root C-chemistry. Significant soil x species interactions
   were found for total soil-CO2 efflux, root-dependent CO2, soil
   available-e and microbial biomass. In all cases, roots were important
   contributors to C-cycling in the mull soil but not in the mor soil. C
   was more limiting in the mor than in the mull microbial community.
   Plant-N uptake and the mineral-N pool was greater in the mor soil,
   reflecting that soil's higher specific N-supplying capacity
   (N-mineralized:CO2). Seedlings decreased the mineral-N pool in both
   soils, but the presence of roots increased N-mineralization in the mull
   soil and decreased N-mineralization in the mor soil. Significant
   positive relationships were observed in the mull soil only between soil
   respiration and plant N uptake at mid-season, and between soil
   respiration and N-mineralization at late-season. Birch root activity in
   the mull soil was greater than that of all other seedlings and this
   observation is discussed with respect to the autecology of birch. Soil
   respiration correlated with the non-polar extract content but not the
   lignin:N ratio of fine roots. Results suggest that root-released C in
   mull SOM is sufficient to relieve energy limitation to soil microbes and
   allow them to access appreciable amounts of soil-N, whereas ligninolytic
   activity, which may ultimately control soil-N turnover in mor SOM, is
   not increased by rhizodeposition.}},

Abstract = {{Scots pine (Pious sylvestris L.) were selectively seeded in 1990, 1991,
   1992, and 1994 in bottom layer vegetation of Pleurozium schreberi
   (Bird.) Mitt. in a clearcut created in 1989 and in an adjacent
   undisturbed Scots pine forest of Vaccinium type, in northern Sweden.
   Seedlings from the 1990 seeding established considerably better on the
   clearcut than in the forest. In contrast, seeding done in 1991, 1992,
   and 1994 gave no significant difference in seedling establishment
   between the two sites. Seedlings that established in the clearcut in
   1990 grew significantly larger and had a higher content of macro- and
   micro-nutrients than those in the forest. For seedlings that established
   in 1992, biomass and nutrient content of seedlings in the clearcut did
   not differ from those in the forest. Seedlings established in the
   clearcut in 1990 increased their nutrient content in relation to seed
   supply, while seedlings established in the clearcut in 1992 and those in
   the forest had in general gained less or even lost nutrients (especially
   P) in relation to seed reserve. These results indicate that Pleurozium
   schreberi-dominated microsites can constitute a favourable microhabitat
   for pine regeneration following stand disturbance, although the positive
   effect quickly diminishes with time after disturbance. The higher
   establishment and growth of emerging seedlings the Ist year after
   cutting compared with later established cohorts in the clearcut may be
   caused by changes in nutrient availability. We propose that
   environmental stress after cutting temporarily diminishes the effect of
   the nutrient barrier formed by Pleurozium schreberi, ericoid mycorrhiza,
   and ericaceous dwarfshrubs. We conclude that successful natural pine
   regeneration in Pleurozium schreberi-dominated vegetation induced by
   clear-cutting can be severely time restricted. This is an important
   consideration when dealing with forestry methods that depend on natural

Abstract = {{Poor growth of conifer regeneration occurred on sites formerly occupied
   by old-growth cedar-hemlock (CH) forests in coastal British Columbia,
   5-8 years after clearcutting and slashburning. Symptoms included
   chlorotic foliage and growth check of Sitka spruce, western hemlock,
   western red cedar and amabilis fir, coincident with the expansion of the
   ericaceous shrub, salal, on the cutovers. Fertilization trials
   identified N and P deficiencies as the cause of the growth check of
   conifers, and additions of 300 kg N ha(-1) and 100 kg P ha(-1)
   significantly improved tree growth rates. Equivalent growth responses
   were achieved with additions of sewage sludge and fish silage. Burning,
   cultivating, liming, higher planting densities or herbicide application,
   were less effective in promoting conifer growth. The nutrient
   deficiencies in conifers on CH cutovers were the result of two factors:
   low nutrient availability in soil and humus, and competition and
   interference from salal. Salal immobilized substantial amounts of N in
   biomass and an in vitro study suggested it was able to use organic forms
   of N through its mycorrhizal fungi. The mycorrhizae of salal also
   interfered with those of hemlock, which further reduced their ability to
   take up nutrients. High concentrations of phenolic acids were associated
   with salal which interfere with mineralization and uptake of N. The low
   availability of N and P in CH cutovers originated in forest floors of
   the old-growth forests prior to clearcutting. Nutrient availability was
   low in all layers of the forest floor in CH forests, and this appeared
   to result from three main factors. First, cedar litter contains less N
   and more decay-resistant material than other species, and produces
   forest floors with low rates of N mineralization. Second, the forest
   floors in CH forests are wetter and have less soil fauna than in HA
   forests, leading to incomplete decomposition and mineralization of N.
   Third, the salal understorey in CH forests interferes with
   mineralization of N through the production of tannins.}},

   mesocosm plots were constructed to have a layer of either C- and N-rich

   mineral soil with a very low organic content. The plots were also
   supplied with live pitch pine and blueberry roots or dead pitch pine
   roots in varying quantities based on naturally occurring densities
   (half, same, and double the ambient quantities). All plots were sampled
   1 year after construction (June 1991), and three more times in two
   subsequent years (November 1991, June 1992, June 1993). In the presence
   of live roots, fluorescein diacetate-determined (FDA-active) fungal
   hyphae, total fungal hyphae, and soil moisture decreased significantly
   in the organic material, while no change was associated with the dead
   roots. The FDA-active fungal length in the live-root plots ranged from
   40 to 165 mg(-1) soil, and from 55 to 335 mg(-1) soil in the dead-root
   plots. While the total fungal length in live-root plots remained
   constant over time (similar to 3000 m g(-1) soil), the total fungal
   length in the dead-root plots increased from an initial value of 3000 to
   > 4000 m g(-1) soil at the conclusion of the study. Fungal lengths in

   vermiculite substitute. Soil moisture was higher in the presence of live
   roots in mineral soils, but this did not increase the fungal abundance.
   Inputs of dead roots did not alter the fungal abundance. Overall, we
   demonstrated that live and dead roots had different effects on fungal

   biomass, measured as the ergosterol content of the soil, increased.
   After the end of the acid treatment pH differences decreased between

   fungal hyphae was higher at the acid treated plots. Additionally,
   precipitation of acid mist led to an acceleration of fine root and
   mycorrhizal development and their senescence.
   A total of 79 nematode species were found in the plots. Acidification
   caused a distinct decrease in species number, especially among
   K-strategists like omnivores and predators. The population density was
   not altered, but the dominance and abundance structure of the community
   changed. Acrobeloides nanus, Metateratocephalus crassidens and

   by acidification. The proportion of fungal feeding nematodes increased
   under acid precipitation, but the effect did not last after the end of

   Special attention was taken also to the occurrence of Aphyllophorales

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a conceptual model of integrated plant-soil

   belowground feedbacks, both positive and negative, which can

   primary negative feedbacks share the common feature of reducing the
   amount of nutrients available to plants. These negative feedbacks
   include increased litter C/N ratios, and therefore reduced
   mineralization rates, increased immobilization of available nutrients by
   a larger soil microbial pool, and increased storage of nutrients in
   plant biomass and detritus due to increases in net primary productivity
   (NPP). Most of the primary positive feedbacks share the common feature
   of being plant mediated feedbacks, the only exception being Zak et al.'s
   hypothesis that increased microbial biomass will be accompanied by
   increased mineralization rates. Plant nutrient uptake may be increased
   through alterations in root architecture, physiology, or mycorrhizal
   symbioses. Further, the increased C/N ratios of plant tissue mean that a
   given level of NPP can be achieved with a smaller supply of nitrogen.
   Identification of the net plant-soil feedbacks to enhanced productivity
   with elevated CO2 are a critical first step for any ecosystem. It is
   necessary, however, that we first identify how universally applicable
   the results are from one study or one ecosystem before ecosystem models
   incorporate this information. The effect of elevated CO2 on plant growth
   (including NPP, tissue quality, root architecture, mycorrhizal
   symbioses) can vary greatly for different species and environmental
   conditions. Therefore it is reasonable to expect that different
   ecosystems will show different patterns of interacting positive and
   negative feedbacks within the plant-soil system. This inter-ecosystem
   variability in the potential for long-term growth responses to rising
   CO2 levels implies that we need to parameterize mechanistic models of
   the impact of elevated CO2 on ecosystem productivity using a detailed
   understanding of each ecosystem of interest.}},

   Here we report that the polyphenol concentration of decomposing Pinus

   previously shown that concentrations of polyphenols in P. muricata

   Apparently this feedback to soil conditions controls the dominant form
   in which litter nitrogen is mobilized, facilitating nitrogen recovery
   through pine-mycorrhizal associations, minimizing nitrogen availability
   to competing organisms, and attenuating nitrogen losses from leaching

Abstract = {{Area-based sampling was carried out to investigate the effect of
   thinning and soil properties on accumulation of forest floor carbon (C),
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)
   Karst.) stands in Denmark. Four thinning intensities (unthinned, and
   about 83\%, 67\% and 50\% of unthinned basal area) were investigated at
   three sites in Denmark: a calcareous, relatively nutrient rich soil with
   a sandy loam/loam texture and two soils with low to intermediate
   nutritional status and sandy loam and loamy sand textures, respectively.
   The effect of thinning on accumulated carbon and nitrogen was
   significant at two of the investigated sites. Accumulated phosphorus was
   significantly affected by thinning at one of these two sites and at the
   third site. Accumulated carbon and phosphorus were negatively linearly
   correlated with thinning intensity. pH tended to be highest and C/N and
   C/P ratios tended to be lowest in the heaviest thinned plots. It is
   hypothesized that the differences in accumulation may be due to a more
   favourable microclimate and substrate for saprophytic organisms in the
   most heavily thinned plots. However, the differences between sites were
   greater than differences between thinning intensities. The accumulation
   of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the forest floors was much higher
   at the two less fertile sites with loamy sand and sandy loam than at the
   relatively fertile site with sandy loam/loam. Significant differences in
   pH and in C/N and C/P ratios at the three sites indicate that the
   amounts of available nutrients influence the mineralization pattern. In
   addition, at the site with the greatest forest floor root density,
   competition for nutrients and moisture between mycorrhiza-infected roots
   and free-living saprophytic decomposers may be co-responsible for the
   large amounts of accumulated carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.}},

   N-15- ammonium or N-15-nitrate and uptake of these two tracers was
   followed during two successive growing seasons (1991 and 1992).
   N-15-labeling (62 mg N-15 m(-2) under conditions of 1.5 g N m(-2)
   atmospheric nitrogen deposition) did not increase N concentrations in
   plant tissues. The N-15 recovery within the entire stand (including
   soils) was 94\% +/- 6\% of the applied N-15- ammonium tracer and 100\%
   +/- 6\% of the applied N-15- nitrate tracer during the Ist year of
   investigation. This decreased to 80\% +/- 24\% and 83\% +/- 20\%,
   respectively, during the 2nd year. After 11 days, the N-15 tracer was
   detectable in 1-year-old spruce needles and leaves of understory
   species. After 1 month, tracer was detectable in needle litter fall. At
   the end of the first growing season, more than 50\% of the N-15 taken up
   by spruce was assimilated in needles, and more than 20\% in twigs. The
   relative distribution of recovered tracer of both N-15-ammonium and
   N-15-nitrate was similar within the different foliage age classes
   (recent to ii-year-old) and other compartments of the trees. N-15
   enrichment generally decreased with increasing tissue age. Roots
   accounted for up to 20\% of the recovered N-15 in spruce; no enrichment
   could be detected in stem wood. Although N-15-ammonium and N-15-nitrate
   were applied in the same molar quantities ((NH4+)-N-15:(NO3-)-N-15
   =1:1), the tracers were diluted differently in the inorganic soil N
   pools ((NH4+)-N-15/NH4+: (NO3-)-N-15/NO3- = 1:9). Therefore the measured
   N-15 amounts retained by the vegetation do not represent the actual
   fluxes of ammonium and nitrate in the soil solution. Use of the molar
   ammonium-to-nitrate ratio of 9:1 in the soil water extract to estimate
   N-15 uptake from inorganic N pools resulted in a 2-4 times higher

Abstract = {{This study examines the impacts of woody, N-2-fixing invasive Acacia
   spp. on the patterns of nutrient cycling in two invaded ecosystems of
   differing nutrient status in the Cape floristic region. Patterns of soil
   nutrient mineralization were measured by a field incubation method while
   the significance of the fixation process in altering nutrient cycling
   was assessed by the delta(15)N natural abundance technique. The results
   confirm earlier reports that invasion by woody shrubs results in organic
   matter and nutrient enrichment of surface soils of both ecosystems.
   However, patterns of nutrient availability (phosphorus and nitrogen)
   were not necessarily enhanced. In the more fertile strandveld both
   phosphorus and nitrogen (significant at P<0.10) showed trends towards
   enhanced annual mineralization rates upon invasion, while in the low
   nutrient fynbos system only phosphorus followed this trend. It is
   unclear whether this differential response is a consequence of plant- or
   soil-derived feedbacks on the decomposition processes in each system.
   The delta(15)N values of the soils from the invaded sites of both
   ecosystems indicated a strong influence of the alien species on the soil
   nitrogen component. However, as with other studies of natural
   ecosystems, the contribution of nitrogen from fixation could not be
   readily quantified with the delta(15)N natural abundance method because
   of problems in selecting suitable non-N-2-fixing reference plants. A
   technique of disrupting nodule structure and function, by fumigation
   with O-2, to Obtain the delta(15)N value of a non-N-2-fixing specimen of

   mineralization rates. In the strandveld ecosystem with much higher soil
   nitrogen release rates A. cyclops was only partly dependent on fixation
   (about half) for its nitrogen. The nutrient enrichment of both
   ecosystems and trends towards enhanced rates of nutrient mineralization
   could have profound implications on the long-term success of alien

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal fungi exhibit high diversity even in small monoculture
   forests. Roughly 20 to 35 species typically occupy such sites.
   Explanations for this diversity can be based on resource partitioning,
   disturbance, competition, or interaction with other organisms.
   Mycorrhizal fungi compete for two general classes of resources:
   host-derived carbon and soil or detritus derived mineral nutrients. Both
   types of resources are arrayed in space (e.g., soil depth, distance from
   tree) and time (e.g., season, host successional series). Some species
   seem to be partitioned in space and time at these scales, but the
   question of how widespread these patterns are remains largely
   unanswered. Mineral resources are distributed in discrete substrates in
   soil, litter, and within other soil microorganisms; the biochemical
   diversity exhibited by fungi may translate into differences in access to
   these resources among species. Small-scale natural disturbances that
   sever roots, mix soil horizons and litter layers, or change local pH and
   nutrient availability, are likely to create additional habitats for
   ectomycorrhizal fungi. Evidence from fruiting patterns and differences
   in colonization strategies suggest that such disturbances may be
   important for establishment of some species. Competitive replacement
   networks among species have the theoretical potential to increase
   diversity. The frequency of species replacements, observed co-infections
   of ectomycorrhizal fungi on single host roots, and high rates of rootlet
   turn-over all suggest that competition is important, but whether it
   plays a creative role in maintaining diversity remains to be
   demonstrated. Other organisms could be important in the maintenance of
   diversity, if they effect competition among mycorrhizal fungi. Bacteria
   and soil invertebrates are the most likely groups for such interactions.
   Technological advances in root observation and PCR methods for
   identification of mycorrhizae make many of these theories testable.}},

   formation of ectomycorrhiza and on removal of animal wastes, is
   described. In forest habitats where animal wastes such as urine or
   faeces or dead bodies, mainly of mammals, have been deposited, a
   particular group of fungi form reproductive structures successionally
   after the apparent decomposition of the wastes. This natural event can
   be simulated by application to the soil of urea, aqueous ammonia, or
   nitrogen compounds that release ammonia on decomposition. Both field
   observations and simulation experiments show that, when these events
   take place in forests of ectomycorrhizal trees, ectomycorrhizal fungi
   fruit during the late phase in the succession. Ectomycorrhizas are in
   fact observed in the soils colonized by these fungi. Among these fungi,
   Hebeloma spp., Laccaria spp., and a few others colonize commonly in
   various waste sites, while Hebeloma radicosum colonizes specifically in
   moles' deserted middens (latrines) near their nests. The animals
   involved here as waste depositors or cadavers seem not to feed on the
   fungi and the plants but may depend on them for cleaning their own
   habitats, since mycorrhizas should readily remove products derived from
   wastes. The tripartite relationship described may be viewed as a
   cleaning symbiosis.}},

   the forest floor was carried out in a 28 years old species trial
   including Norway spruce, Douglas fir, beech, and common oak at two
   sites, a poor and sandy soil, and a fertile loamy soil.
   The accumulation of C, N and P in the forest floor was significantly
   higher at the sandy site than at the loamy site under all species. At
   the loamy site, oak was characterized by lesser accumulation of C, N and
   P than the other species. Remarkably, the C/N-ratios showed no
   substantial differences, whereas the C/P-ratios were significantly
   higher at the sandy site for all species. pH was significantly lower at
   the sandy site for all species, and among the species, pH was lower in
   the conifer forest floors than in the broadleave forest floors. The
   concentration of ammonium, nitrate and phosphate in the soil solution
   was much higher at the loamy site under all species showing a stronger
   microbial activity. It is therefore hypothesized that the differences in
   accumulation rates were, at least partly, caused by differences in the
   mineralization regimes. Strong root infiltration in the forest floors at
   the sandy site compared to almost none at the loamy site, is probably
   responsible for the differences in mineralization rate due to
   competition between the organic matter decomposers and the

Abstract = {{Natural abundances of nitrogen isotopes, delta(15)N, indicate that, in
   the same habitat, Alaskan Picea glauca and P. mariana use a different
   soil nitrogen compartment from the evergreen shrub Vaccinium vitis-idaea
   or the deciduous grass Calamagrostis canadensis. The very low delta(15)N
   values (-7.7 \%) suggest that (1) Picea mainly uses inorganic nitrogen
   (probably mainly ammonium) or organic N in fresh litter, (2) Vaccinium
   (-4.3 \%) with its ericoid mycorrhizae uses more stable organic matter,
   and (3) Calamagrostis (+0.9 \%) exploits deeper soil horizons with
   higher delta(15)N values of soil N. We conclude that species limited by
   the same nutrient may coexist by drawing on different pools of soil N in
   a nutrient-deficient environment. The differences among life-forms
   decrease with increasing N availability. The different levels of
   delta(15)N are associated with different nitrogen concentrations in
   leaves, Picea having a lower N concentration (0.62 mmol g(-1)) than
   Vaccinium (0.98 mmol g(-1)) or Calamagrostis (1.33 mmol g(-1)). An
   extended vector analysis by Timmer and Armstrong (1987) suggests that N
   is the most limiting element for Picea in this habitat, causing needle
   yellowing at N concentrations below 0.5 mmol g(-1) or N contents below 2
   mmol needle(-1). Increasing N supply had an exponential effect on twig
   and needle growth. Phosphorus, potassium and magnesium are at marginal
   supply, but not interaction between ammonium supply and needle Mg
   concentration could be detected. Calcium is in adequate supply on both
   calcareous and acidic soils. The results are compared with European
   conditions of excessive N supply from anthropogenic N depositions.}},

Abstract = {{1 Patterns of fine root biomass, morphology, growth and longevity were
   examined in the northern hardwood zone of Hubbard Brook Experimental
   Forest to aid understanding of the role of roots in ecosystem function.
   2 Fine root biomass in the mature hardwood forest was 471 g m(-2) for <
   2 mm roots in June 1987 and was concentrated in the surface soil, with
   43\% in the forest floor horizons. After clearcutting, fine root biomass
   accumulated rapidly in the regrowing forest, reaching 71\% of that in
   the mature forest after only four years of recovery.
   3 Fine root diameter distributions and specific root length (SRL;
   length/mass) differed among species. SRL was higher in the forest floor
   than mineral soil horizons, and decreased with increasing root diameter.
   4 Fine root production in the mature forest, measured with in-growth
   cores, averaged 254 gm(-2) year(-1), but this method probably
   underestimated production. Rapid disappearance of fine roots was
   observed for roots growing through in situ screens, and these ephemeral
   roots are difficult to quantify.
   5 The initiation of fine root growth in the forest floor was coincident
   with leaf expansion in the forest canopy; root growth in the mineral
   soil began 1-2 weeks later. Root growth was most rapid in early summer
   (mid-June to early July), and the lifespan of these early season roots
   averaged about 8-10 months across three years of study. This estimate of
   longevity was consistent with that obtained from the ratio of fine root
   biomass to production, after correcting the production value for the
   observed root disappearance from in situ screens (about 50\% of fine
   roots disappeared from screens within an annual cycle). These longevity
   estimates also appeared to be consistent with an analysis of the soil C
   budget based upon soil and fine root respiration and total root
   allocation. Fine root production was apparently nearly twice as high as
   leaf production in this ecosystem.
   6 These fine root production and turnover estimates are not consistent
   with results from previous studies of fine root decomposition, and we
   suggest that fine root decay has been underestimated because existing
   methods inhibit the saprotrophic activity of rhizosphere organisms.}},

Abstract = {{More than 400 species of vascular plants, in 87 genera, are
   achlorophyllous and heterotrophic, but not directly parasitic upon
   autotrophs. They are usually, but incorrectly, described as
   `saprophytes' since they are in fact nourished by means of specialized
   mycorrhizal associations. Although distributed world-wide, they are most
   abundant and show the greatest species-richness in the Neotropics and
   Palaeotropical regions. Their aerial parts range in size from a few
   centimetres to extensive liane types up to 40 m long. With few
   exceptions, their habitats are dense moist forests in which there is a
   surface accumulation of leaf litter, often in situations which are too
   shaded for autotrophic growth.
   Although the achlorophyllous mycorrhizal mode of life has evolved
   independently many times and in widely disparate taxonomic groups, such
   plants show strong convergent evolution in particular adaptations to
   their peculiar mode of life. Most prominant amongst these are reductions
   in the size of seed and embryo, and the lack of differentiation of the
   embryo at maturity. The number of seeds produced by each flower is
   typically very large and the shape, structure and surface features of
   seeds involving adaptation for wind dispersal show remarkable parallels
   in many species. Specific adaptations for zoochory are rare but well
   developed in a small number of genera, some of which produce scents like
   fungal fruit bodies or floral parts which mimic fungal sporocarps.
   Vegetative parts are often even more conspicuously reduced. Most
   myco-heterotrophs are entirely subterranean for most of their lives and
   these stages exhibit adaptations consistent with a change in function
   from organs of absorption to organs of storage, shown by the almost
   universal loss of root hairs, decrease in surface area as exhibited in
   short cylindric `vermiform' and tuberous roots or, in extreme cases, the
   complete suppression of roots and the formation of a swollen tuber or
   rhizome. Increased width of the root cortex often accommodates
   mycorrhizal infection and stores of carbohydrates and other materials
   obtained from the fungal symbiont. Mycorrhizal infection is confined to
   the below-ground parts of the plants but may be found there in modified
   stems as well as in roots.
   In many genera, stems are exceptionally slender and thread-like and
   their vascular tissues are either reduced to a single narrow cylinder of
   bicollateral bundles or, minimally, to four or six narrow bundles in the
   cortex. Secondary thickening is poorly developed in all but a tiny
   minority of species, lignification being confined to annular or, rarely,
   a few scalariform xylem vessels. Phloem is present in very small amounts
   and then mainly as parenchyma with sieve tubes frequently recorded as

   Leaves are typically reduced to widely spaced achlorophyllous scales on
   the inflorescence axis. Occasionally, they are present only on
   underground rhizomes or tubers. The vascular supply to the leaf-scales,
   normally reduced to a single trace, may be absent. Vestigial stomata are

Title = {{MECHANISMS OF PRIMARY SUCCESSION FOLLOWING DEGLACIATION AT GLACIER BAY,

Abstract = {{In primary succession following deglaciation at Glacier Bay, Alaska, we
   tested the hypothesis that the major effect of initial nitrogen-fixing
   colonizers is to facilitate establishment of late-successional dominants
   and that other possible causes of successional change (e.g., life
   history factors governing seed rain and competitive interactions among
   species) need not be invoked. Environment changed dramatically through
   the first 200 yr of succession. Soil organic matter increased 10-fold in
   the upper mineral soil with corresponding increases in soil moisture,
   total nitrogen (N), and capacity to support plant growth and declines in
   bulk density, pH, and total phosphorus (P). Plant growth in pioneer
   soils tended to be simultaneously limited by both N and P, as well as by
   unknown factors (perhaps lack of mycorrhizae), whereas only P limited
   growth in older soils. Light availability to seedlings declined through
   succession.
   Early-successional species (Epilobium latifolium, Dryas drummondii) had
   smaller seeds, younger age at first reproduction, shorter life-span, and
   shorter height at maturity than did mid-successional (alder, Alnus
   sinuata) and late-successional species (sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis).
   Seed rain of alder and spruce was negligible in the pioneer stage,
   increased prior to the stage in which a species was dominant, and was
   greatest in the stage in which a species dominated. Vegetation in each
   successional stage inhibited germination and initial establishment of
   sown alder and spruce seeds (except a tendency of the `'black-crust''
   algal/microbial community in the pioneer stage to enhance survivorship).
   Removal of the surface litter layer generally enhanced germination and
   survivorship, particularly of alder. Comparisons of germination in the
   greenhouse and the field indicated that climatic or indirect vegetation
   effects (e.g., differential seed predation) and allelopathy also reduced
   germination and establishment in vegetated communities.
   Naturally occurring spruce seedlings grew most rapidly in the Dryas and
   alder stages and most slowly in the spruce stage. Similarly, growth of
   spruce seedlings transplanted into each successional stage was
   facilitated by the Dryas (nonsignificantly) and alder stages but
   inhibited by the spruce stage, relative to earlier successional stages.
   Facilitation of growth of natural and transplanted spruce seedlings by
   Dryas and alder stages was associated with higher N and P uptake and
   tissue nutrient concentrations, whereas nutrient uptake and
   concentration in spruce seedlings declined in the spruce stage. By
   contrast, transplanted alder seedlings grew rapidly and accumulated most
   nutrients in the pioneer stage and were strongly inhibited by subsequent
   stages.
   The facilitative effect of Dryas and alder comes primarily from inputs
   of organic matter and associated N. Addition of alder litter stimulated
   nutrient uptake and growth of transplanted spruce seedlings in the
   pioneer and Dryas stages, whereas shading had no effect on growth of
   spruce seedlings. Root trenching and planting of spruce near isolated
   alders indicated that, although the net effect of alder is facilitative,
   alder also inhibits growth of spruce seedlings through competition for
   soil resources. Strong root competition also occurs in the spruce stage.
   Alder competitively inhibits Dryas, primarily by shading but also
   through the physical and allelopathic effects of its litter.
   In general, both at Glacier Bay and elsewhere, life history traits
   determine the pattern of succession. Changes in competitive balance
   accompanying successional changes in environment provide the mechanism
   for changes in species dominance. Initial site conditions (and
   facilitation, where present) influence the rate of change and final
   state of community composition and productivity. We conclude that no
   single factor or mechanism fully accounts for primary succession at
   Glacier Bay.}},

   amount of microbial biomass, it correlated best with the heavy metal
   concentrations in the soil especially in the most polluted stands. The
   decomposition of cellulose cardboard strips exposed in the held for 1 yr

Abstract = {{A 3 year field and pot study was conducted to determine the effects of
   several biotic and abiotic factors on the early growth of western
   hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), western redcedar (Thuja
   plicata, Donn) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis, Bong. Carr.)
   seedlings established on 2- and 8-year-old clearcut sites previously
   occupied by old-growth western hemlock and western redcedar forests
   (referred to as younger and older CH, respectively), and on adjacent
   2-year-old clearcut sites previously occupied by second-growth western
   hemlock and amabilis fir (Amabilis amabilis (Dougl.) Forbes) forests
   (referred to as younger HA) in coastal British Columbia. The objective
   of the study was to determine which factors are associated with the poor
   growth characteristic of the salal (Gaultheria shallon, Pursh) dominated
   CH clearcut sites.
   No soil moisture deficits were measured on any of the three types of
   clearcut sites at any time of year. The best seeding growth was on the
   younger HA sites followed by the younger CH sites and then the older CH
   sites. The better growth on the younger HA sites was associated with a
   higher availability of N and P in the first 20 cm depth of the forest
   floor. No differences in matric soil water potential and pH, and only
   small differences in soil temperature were measured between the three
   types of clearcut sites. Complete removal of the competing vegetation on
   the younger and older CH sites resulted in an increase in conifer
   seedling growth and in the availability of N (22-40\%) and P (15-32\%);
   however, it did not affect cellulose decomposition and matric soil water
   potential, and increased soil temperature only slightly. Both western
   hemlock and Sitka spruce seedlings were very responsive to differences
   in nutrient availability measured between types of clearcut sites and
   planting treatments. In contrast, western redcedar was not responsive.
   All three conifer species had very high mycorrhizal colonization on the
   younger CH sites, and this was not altered by the removal of the
   competing vegetation (mainly salal).
   These results suggest that the nutritional stress and poor growth of
   conifers on salal-dominated CH clearcut sites in coastal British
   Columbia can be explained by: (1) inherently low forest floor nutrient
   availability; (2) competition between salal and conifer seedlings for
   scarce nutrients and nutrient immobilization in salal; (3) declining
   nutrient availability a few years after clearcutting and slashburning.}},

Abstract = {{1. The seasonally deciduous tree species Bombax ceiba L. and Sterculia
   quadrifida R. Br. formed 9.1\% and 2.3\%, respectively, of the total
   basal area in a coastal dry monsoon rainforest in the Australian
   seasonally dry tropics. Neither species occurred in a nearby Eucalyptus
   savanna.
   2. Both communities occurred on deep, iron-rich, sandy loam soils. The
   savanna had lower concentrations of nutrients in the surface soil than
   the rainforest but experienced greater maximum ground surface air
   temperatures than the monsoon rainforest when averaged over 1 year.
   Minimum air temperatures were similar. Annual mean surface soil moisture
   content was similar in savanna and rainforest, but savanna soils were
   drier in the dry season. During this time both communities had soil
   matric pressure potentials below 1-3 MPa.
   3. S. quadrifida established more successfully in the rainforest than in
   the savanna but B. ceiba establishment was <2\% in both communities.
   Nursery experiments also showed that B. ceiba had a consistently lower
   rate of establishment than S. quadrifida, and that seed establishment of
   both species was greatest on unsterilized rainforest and savanna soil.
   Adding 40\% gravel to savanna soil also resulted in improved
   establishment. Eucalyptus litter, light, and rainforest or savanna soil
   were found to have no significant effect on seed establishment of either
   species.
   4. After 12 months 70\% of B. ceiba and 40\% of S. quadrifida seedlings
   survived following transplantation to the rainforest. No transplants
   survived in the savanna, but transplants of both species survived in an
   irrigated savanna. Grass fires were not absolutely lethal to both
   species on an irrigated savanna plot. Soil sterilization inhibited the
   growth of both species on rainforest soils in pots, but adding
   fertilizer eliminated the growth inhibition caused by sterilization
   except when B. ceiba was grown on rainforest soil. Eucalyptus litter,
   light and different proportions of gravel in the soil had no effect on
   seedling growth rates of either species.
   5. It is concluded that the long-term development of a
   monsoon-rainforest-savanna ecotone is critical for creating
   microclimatic and soil conditions favourable for monsoon-rainforest
   seedling establishment and growth. Experiments point toward the
   importance of mycorrhizas, soil fertility and soil moisture in
   controlling monsoon-rainforest seedling establishment. This study helps
   explain why so few monsoon-rainforest seedlings have been observed to
   establish in fire-protected Eucalyptus savannas.}},

   structure and an understanding of how disturbance alters their
   structure,and function. Theoretical and empirical studies of food webs
   demonstrate that food webs possess a regular structure. Food chain
   length appears limited to three to four transfers, and, complexity and
   diversity are constrained. When ecosystem energetics are considered,
   species within food webs are seen to form interactive assemblages that
   process matter at different rates and respond to disturbance
   differently. Disturbance may affect the diversity of a system, or, may
   influence the relative importance of one species assemblage over
   another. Moreover, predicting the impact of disturbance on a system is
   difficult as species that comprise and process a small fraction of the
   system's biomass may control a disproportionate fraction of the system's
   biomass and diversity. Seven food webs at four sites were used in a
   modeling exercise to demonstrate this point. Field studies involving the
   role of mycorrhizal fungi yielded results consistent with the modeling
   studies as the types of plant species present, the level of production
   and the diversity of production were related to the levels of

   composition, disturbance histories, and soil parent materials; the soils
   at the different topographic positions vary principally in the thickness
   of the organic horizon. Each toposequence consisted of lowland,

   on exposed topographic rises within the region. Root biomass was
   determined for three depths (organic horizon, 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm
   mineral soil) and three size classes (<1, 1-5, and >5 mm). Total, fine,
   and intermediate root biomass was greatest at lowland sites and least at
   sites in the pygmy pine stands. Total and fine root biomass in both the
   forest floor and also the upper mineral layer was linearly related to
   thickness of the organic horizon. The percent allocation of roots among
   soil layers, and the percentage of roots in different size classes
   within each soil depth interval, were similar for lowland, transition,

   relative quantities of total and fine roots in the mineral soil than in
   the organic horizon. In the organic horizons at all topographic
   positions, 50-100\% of the roots are fine roots, whereas only 10-20\% of
   the roots in the mineral layers are fine roots. Although root biomass
   per unit area varies >2-fold from lowland to pygmy sites, biomass per
   unit volume of organic material does not vary among topographic
   positions. Volumes of organic matter are more densely filled with roots
   than are comparable volumes of mineral soil. Implications for the role
   of roots in nutrient cycling in different soil horizons are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrated that allelopathy is an
   important factor explaining seed regeneration failures of Scots pine
   (Pinus silvestris L.) in forest floor vegetation dominated by the dwarf
   shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup. Scanning electron micrograph
   views of the leaf surfaces of E. hermaphroditum reveal secretory glands
   that are shown to be involved in the release of water-soluble phytotoxic
   substances. Bioassays indicate that low doses and short exposure times
   of seeds to leachates have strong negative effects on germination and
   early root development. Activated carbon can eliminate the inhibitory
   effects of leachates and litter. This technique demonstrates the
   occurrence of allelopathic interference by E. hermaphroditum on seed
   germination of both Scots pine and aspen (Populus tremula L.). In a
   field experiment the allelopathic effects by E. hermaphroditum are
   strong during early spring when germination and growth initiate and
   ground ice still is present. Extracts passed through soils collected
   from an E. hermaphroditum site were detoxified, while those passed
   through sterilized soil were not. Therefore, microorganisms may detoxify

Abstract = {{The guild and functional group concepts are generally accepted as
   suitable units in ecosystem modelling, when interspecific relationships
   and energy or nutrient flows are studied.  It is argued, however, that
   members of a feeding guild assemblage can have specific effects on
   ecosystem processes through microstratification, particularly in
   stratified habitats such as soils.  A new concept, `league', is
   introduced which follows a guild-like classification, but assembles
   organisms by their exploitation or processing of more than one habitat
   resource in a homologous manner.  The concept is illustrated for soil
   fauna feeding habits and choice of microhabitat, and the classification
   is discussed in view of soil fauna mediated decomposition and nutrient
   cycling processes.  Using literature review data, three leagues are
   hypothesized for soil fungivores.  Epigeic fungus engulfers interact
   with fungal colonization of fresh leaf litter, with the potential for
   affecting decomposition rate.  Hemiedaphic fungus engulfers affect net
   mineralization and nutrient mobilization in fragmented litter. 
   Euedaphic fungus engulfers have the potential to affect plant growth by
   interference with mycorrhizal establishment or nutrient uptake by the
   roots.  Detritivorous soil fauna taxa are also discussed.  It is argued
   that league classification of soil fauna offers a close relationship

Abstract = {{The importance of the ground vegetation and soil microbial biomass as

   investigated.  Lysimeters containing the organic horizons were
   established with the treatments brash, Agrostis capillaris (L.) and/or
   Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) seedlings in a limited
   factorial design.  Following a period of 15 months, during which
   chemical analysis of the lysimeter leachates were carried out, the
   lysimeters were destructively sampled and the vegetation and soil
   microbial biomass nitrogen pools measured.  The effect of the different
   treatments on the decomposition rate of the organic matter and the
   growth and nutrient status of the young Sitka spruce trees was also
   determined.
   A comparison of the nitrogen pools and the cumulative leachate results
   identified the grass as the major sink for nitrogen with uptake over a
   15 month period equivalent to 2.66 g N m-2 at 50-75\% cover.  Uptake by
   the Sitka spruce was also significant with net uptake ranging from 0.6 g
   N m-2 when growing with the grass to 1.74 g N m-2 when planted within a
   pile of brash.  The microbial biomass nitrogen pool was unchanged by the
   presence of the grass species but was significantly increased in the
   lysimeters containing brash and/or Sitka spruce (possibly owing to the
   presence of mycorrhizal fungi).  The microbial N pool was greatest in
   the treatment containing the combination of the trees planted within the
   brash, with 3.49 (+/- 0.52) g N m-2 as microbial biomass N compared with
   1.99 (+/- 0.24) g N m-2 in the control lysimeters containing neither
   brash nor trees.  The growth of the Sitka spruce was highly variable
   within treatments, however, the mean biomass m-2 doubled if planted
   within the brash, and also resulted in elevated foliar concentrations of
   nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus.  When in competition with the grass,
   tree biomass was halved, tree needles appeared chlorotic and phosphorus
   concentrations were halved.  The management implications for harvesting
   intensity on upland sites are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Recent changes in the species diversity and sporocarp production of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi in different regions of, and forest communities
   within, Europe are discussed with special emphasis on events in The
   Netherlands.  In some forests in some regions fewer ectomycorrhizal
   fungi are now producing sporocarps, notably those associated with trees
   more than 40 years old and in particular conifers, for instance species
   of Phellodon, Hydnellum, Suillus, Tricholoma and Cortinarius.  It is
   argued that this decline in different parts of Europe is coincident with
   decreased numbers of mycorrhizas.  A scheme of progressive changes with
   three phases of ectomycorrhizal impoverishment and seven subphases is
   presented.  The more probable causes of decline are discussed, namely
   forest succession, the collection of sporocarps (of edible mycorrhizal
   fungi), changes in forest management, direct influences of air
   pollutants, acidification of forest soils and consequent increased
   availability of aluminium in soil solution, nitrogen deposition,
   increased litter accumulation, changes in the herb layer of forests and
   reduced tree vitality.
   It is argued that changes in the populations of ectomycorrhizal fungi
   are most likely to be attributable to indirect effects of air pollution,
   in particular to increases in amounts of available nitrogen (possibly in
   combination with acidification) and/or to decreased tree vitality with
   consequent reductions in the transport of current assimilates to roots
   and mycorrhizas.  The relative importance of these different factors,
   and their interactions, are likely to differ in different locations.  It
   is supposed that liming and applications of other corrective fertilizers
   are unlikely to restore the diversity and sporocarp production of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi; they may even have adverse effects.  In the
   circumstances therefore it seems that the abatement of emissions is
   likely to be the only effective way of improving and sustaining stable
   forest ecosystems in areas at risk, notably in densely populated Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Specialized ectomycorrhizal fungi form dense mats in forest soils that
   have different enzyme levels, higher respiration rates, more biomass,
   different soil fauna, and different soil chemistry compared with
   adjacent soils not obviously colonized by these mats.  In this study,
   mats formed by two genera of fungi collected in three locations were
   compared with a wide range of measurements.  Per cent moisture, pH,
   chloroform fumigation-flush C, anaerobic N mineralization, exchangeable
   ammonium, and respiration, N2 fixation, and denitrification rates were
   compared between soils or litter colonized by ectomycorrhizal
   mat-forming fungi and adjacent non-mat material.  Significant
   differences were observed between the two genera of mat-forming fungi
   and also between mats formed primarily in mineral soil and those formed
   in litter.  These differences suggest that different mat-forming fungi
   perform different functions in forest soils and that these fungi
   function differently in mineral soil compared with litter.}},

Abstract = {{The ectomycorrhizal fungus Hysterangium setchellii (Fisher) forms
   extensive hyphal mats at the soil-litter interface with the roots of its
   host tree Douglas fir \{Pseudotsuga menziesii {[}(Mirb.) Franco]\}. 
   Microbial biomass, needle decomposition rates, nutrient release from
   needles and exchangeable soil nutrients were measured in ectomycorrhizal
   mat soils and adjacent non-mat soils in a second-growth Douglas fir
   forest periodically throughout 1 yr.  Microbial biomass and needle
   decomposition were 4.0 and 1.1 times higher, respectively, in mat soils
   than in adjacent non-mat soils during the year of sampling.  After 1 yr
   of decomposition, needle litter concentrations of K and Mg decreased in
   both soil types, and release of both nutrients was greater in mats than
   in non-mat soils.  Needle litter concentrations of Ca, Mn, Cu, Zn and Al
   increased during the year in both soil types, but nutrient absorption by
   needles tended to be highest in non-mat soils.  Concentrations of N, P,
   Fe and B in needle litter did not change during the year, yet nearly
   twice as much N and P were released in mat soils compared to non-mat
   soils, suggesting either faster decomposition or nutrient import to mat
   soils.  Soil solution concentrations of NH4, P, K, Mg and Zn measured by
   absorption onto ion-exchange resins, did not differ between mat and
   non-mat soils.  Mat soils had higher concentrations of NO3, Fe, Cu and B
   but lower concentrations of Ca and Mn compared to non-mat soils. 
   Nutrients released from the decomposing needles but not absorbed by
   ion-exchange resins must be rapidly removed from the soil solution
   either by plant roots, microbial tissue, saprophytic fungi or via
   ectomycorrhizal translocation to host trees.  Our data suggest that the
   ectomycorrhizal fungus H. setchelli provides an improved
   microenvironment for organic matter decomposition resulting in faster
   release of N, P, K and Mg and more efficient removal of the nutrients
   from the soil solution.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesized that the grazing of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal
   (VAM) hyphae by soil animals could be responsible for the lack of a
   direct relationship between mycorrhizal infection intensity and nutrient
   uptake under field conditions. To test this hypothesis, we determined
   the effect of a range of densities of the collembola, Folsomia candida,
   on growth, VAM infection, and P uptake in Geranium robertianum, a common
   forest herb, under greenhouse conditions. Total and aboveground growth
   were greater at low collembola density than either at higher collembola
   density or without collembola. These differences were greater when the
   plants were grown in a high organic content soil mix than when grown in
   sand. Root mass was not affected by collembola density. In the soil mix,
   root length decreased with increasing collembola density, but not in the
   sand. The percent of root length infected with VAM was lower at any
   collembola density than when collembola were absent. Total infected root
   length decreased linearly with increasing collembola density. Few
   significant differences in P uptake or tissue concentration were found.
   Thus, plant growth (but not P uptake) may be stimulated at low
   collembola density and inhibited at high. We discuss mechanisms which
   may be responsible for this non-linear response, and the implications of
   the pattern of response to studies of plant competition, nutrient
   turnover, and revegetation.}},
