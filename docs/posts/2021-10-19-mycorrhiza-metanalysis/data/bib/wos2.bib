Abstract = {{Background: Connections between mature trees and seedlings via
   ectomycorrhizal (EcM) hyphal networks existing in dipterocarp-dominated
   tropical rain forests of South- east Asia could have strong implications
   for seedling growth and survival and the maintenance of high diversity
   in such forests.
   Aim: To test whether EcM hyphal network connections are important for
   the growth and survival of dipterocarp seedlings.
   Methods: We conducted four independent experiments that prevented
   contact of experimental seedlings with an EcM network by using a series
   of fine meshes and/ or plastic barriers. We measured the growth and
   survival (and foliar delta C-13 in one experiment) of seedlings of six
   dipterocarp species over intervals ranging from 11 to 29 months.
   Results: Seedling growth (diameter, height or leaf number) was
   unaffected by exclusion from the EcM network in three experiments and
   there were no differences in foliar d13C values in the fourth. Seedling
   survival was reduced following exclusion from the EcM network in one
   experiment. Our results give little support to the hypothesis that
   dipterocarp seedlings growing in the shaded forest understorey benefit
   from being connected, through a common EcM network, to surrounding
   trees.
   Conclusions: We suggest that our negative results, in contrast to
   studies conducted in low diversity boreo- temperate or tropical forests,
   are due to these high diversity forests lacking host species-specific
   EcM fungi and therefore providing little opportunity for adaptive
   support of seedlings via hyphal networks.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated nitrogen (N) deposition due to increased fossil fuel combustion
   and agricultural practices has altered global carbon (C) cycling.
   Additions of reactive N to N-limited environments are typically
   accompanied by increases in plant biomass. Soil C dynamics, however,
   have shown a range of different responses to the addition of reactive N
   that seem to be ecosystem dependent. We evaluated the effect of N
   amendments on biogeochemical characteristics and microbial responses of
   subalpine forest organic soils in order to develop a mechanistic
   understanding of how soils are affected by N amendments in subalpine
   ecosystems. We measured a suite of responses across three years
   (2011-2013) during two seasons (spring and fall). Following 17 years of
   N amehdments, fertilized soils were more acidic (control mean 5.09,
   fertilized mean 4.68), and had lower \%C (control mean 33.7\% C,
   fertilized mean 29.8\%.C) and microbial biomass C by 22\% relative to
   control plots. Shifts in biogeochemical properties in fertilized plots
   were associated with an altered microbial community driven by reduced
   arbuscular mycorrhizal (control mean 3.2 mol\%, fertilized mean 2.5
   mol\%) and saprotrophic fungal groups (control mean 17.0 mol\%,
   fertilized mean 15.2 mol\%), as well as a decrease in N degrading
   microbial enzyme activity. Our results suggest that decreases in soil C
   in subalpine forests were in part driven by increased microbial
   degradation of soil organic matter and reduced inputs to soil organic
   matter in the form of microbial biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal fungi play a key role in mobilizing nutrients embedded
   in recalcitrant organic matter complexes, thereby increasing nutrient
   accessibility to the host plant. Recent studies have shown that during
   the assimilation of nutrients, the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus
   involutus decomposes organic matter using an oxidative mechanism
   involving Fenton chemistry (Fe2+ + H2O2 + H+ -> Fe3+ + (OH)-O-center dot
   + H2O), similar to that of brown rot wood-decaying fungi. In such fungi,
   secreted metabolites are one of the components that drive one-electron
   reductions of Fe3+ and O-2, generating Fenton chemistry reagents. Here
   we investigated whether such a mechanism is also implemented by P.
   involutus during organic matter decomposition. Activity-guided
   purification was performed to isolate the Fe3+-reducing principle
   secreted by P. involutus during growth on a maize compost extract. The
   Fe3+-reducing activity correlated with the presence of one compound.
   Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) identified this
   compound as the diarylcyclopentenone involutin. A major part of the
   involutin produced by P. involutus during organic matter decomposition
   was secreted into the medium, and the metabolite was not detected when
   the fungus was grown on a mineral nutrient medium. We also demonstrated
   that in the presence of H2O2, involutin has the capacity to drive an in
   vitro Fenton reaction via Fe3+ reduction. Our results show that the
   mechanism for the reduction of Fe3+ and the generation of hydroxyl
   radicals via Fenton chemistry by ectomycorrhizal fungi during organic
   matter decomposition is similar to that employed by the evolutionarily
   related brown rot saprotrophs during wood decay.}},

Abstract = {{Plant invasion often increases stand biomass, but higher tissue quality
   (for example, less lignin and more nutrients) in invasive species might
   accelerate litter decomposition. This mechanism may minimize increases
   in soil carbon (C) sequestration despite higher production. Our
   knowledge about invasion and tissue quality is based on shoots, but
   roots contribute 50-90\% of biomass in vegetation types such as semiarid
   grasslands. Here we investigate root decomposition rates and tissue
   quality in the widespread invasive grass Agropyron cristatum, which
   doubles root mass but not soil C in the Great Plains of North America.
   Root length was significantly greater beneath Agropyron than native
   grassland 7 years after minirhizotron installation. However, CO2
   evolution from decomposing roots was twice as much for Agropyron roots
   as for native grass roots (P < 0.05). CO2 evolution from decomposing
   native grass roots was not significantly different from controls with no
   root tissue added, suggesting that Agropyron invasion can convert
   grassland soil to a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Rapid root
   decomposition was associated with significantly lower lignin content in
   Agropyron roots than native grass roots, although root N and lignin:N
   ratios did not differ. We present the first report of root decomposition
   rates associated with plant invasion. Increases in root length were
   accompanied by increased root decomposition rates of low-lignin tissue,
   such that invasion-driven enhanced productivity did not enhance soil C
   sequestration. Among-species differences in root tissue quality and
   decomposition rates could influence soil C dynamics during invasions of
   systems dominated by belowground production, such as tundra, boreal
   forests, and semiarid grassland.}},

   ecosystems}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{200-211}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Plant growth in boreal forests is commonly limited by a low supply of
   nitrogen, a condition that may be aggravated by high tree below-ground
   allocation of carbon to ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi and associated
   microorganisms. These in turn immobilise N and reduce its availability
   to plants as boreal ecosystems develop. Here, we studied a boreal forest
   ecosystem chronosequence created by new land rising out of the sea due
   to iso-static rebound along the coast of northern Sweden. We used height
   over the ocean to estimate ecosystem age and examined its relationship
   to soil microbial community structure and the gross turnover of N. The
   youngest soils develop with meadows by the coast, followed by a zone of
   N2-fixing alder trees, and primary boreal conifer forest on ground up to
   560 years old. The young soils in meadows contained little organic
   matter and microbial biomass per unit area. Nitrogen was turned over at
   low rates when expressed per area (m(-2)), but specific rates (per gram
   soil carbon (C)) were the highest found along the transect. In the zone
   with alder, the amounts of soil C and microbial biomass were much higher
   (bacterial biomass had doubled and fungal biomass quadrupled). Rates of
   gross N mineralisation (expressed on an area basis) were highest, but
   the retention of added labelled NH4+ was lowest in this soil as compared
   to other ages. The alder zone also had the largest extractable pools of
   inorganic N in soil and highest N \% in plant foliage. In the older
   conifer forest ecosystems the amounts of soil C and N, as well as
   biomass of both bacteria and fungi increased. Data on organic matter
   C-14 suggested that the largest input of recently fixed plant C occurred
   in the younger coniferous forest ecosystems. With increasing ecosystem
   age, the ratio of microbial C to total soil C was constant, whereas the
   ratio of microbial N to total soil N increased and gross N
   mineralization declined. Simultaneously, plant foliar N \% decreased and
   the natural abundance of N-15 in the soil increased. More specifically,
   the difference in delta N-15 between plant foliage and soil increased,
   which is related to relatively greater retention of N-15 relative to
   N-14 by ECM fungi as N is taken up from the soil and some N is
   transferred to the plant host. In the conifer forest, where these
   changes were greatest, we found increased fungal biomass in the F- and
   H-horizons of the mor-layer, in which ECM fungi are known to dominate
   (the uppermost horizon with litter and moss is dominated by saprotrophic
   fungi). Hence, we propose that the decreasing availability of N to the
   plants and the subsequent decline in plant production in ageing boreal
   forests is linked to high tree belowground C allocation to ECM fungi, a
   strong microbial sink for available soil N. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Earthworms (EWs) and mycorrhizal fungi are key components of soil biota
   participating in N recycling from leaf litter. The extent to which their

   colonized by different mycorrhizal types and the variation of these

   experiment to investigate the effects of EWs on plant acquisition of N
   from N-15 enriched ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and beech (Fagus sylvatica)
   leaf litter. We employed arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) ash and
   ectomycorrhizal (EM) beech trees. EW presence did not affect the overall
   root mycorrhizal colonization, but in the beech leaf litter treatment it
   caused a shift in the EM fungal community, favoring species with a
   ruderal life strategy at the expense of more specialized species able to
   degrade organic compounds. No differences in N-15 capture were found
   between EM and AM plants. Generally, 2-7\% of the N released from leaf
   litter was taken up by the plants. EWs uniformly increased plant
   acquisition of N from leaf litter. This effect was more pronounced in
   treatments with ash than in those with beech leaf litter, presumably
   because of higher degradability of ash than of beech litter. The results
   suggest that leaf litter quality dominates the impact of EWs on plant N
   acquisition from leaf litter while the mycorrhizal type is of minor
   importance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Fungal communities have been shown to be highly sensitive toward shifts
   in plant diversity and species composition in forest ecosystems.
   However, little is known about the impact of forest management on fungal
   diversity and community composition of geographically separated sites.
   This study examined the effects of four different forest management
   types on soil fungal communities. These forest management types include
   age class forests of young managed beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), with
   beech stands age of approximately 30 years, age class beech stands with
   an age of approximately 70 years, unmanaged beech stands, and coniferous
   stands dominated by either pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) or spruce (Picea
   abies Karst.) which are located in three study sites across Germany.
   Soil were sampled from 48 study plots and we employed fungal ITS rDNA
   pyrotag sequencing to assess the soil fungal diversity and community
   structure. We found that forest management type significantly affects
   the Shannon diversity of soil fungi and a significant interaction effect
   of study site and forest management on the fungal operational taxonomic
   units richness. Consequently distinct fungal communities were detected
   in the three study sites and within the four forest management types,
   which were mainly related to the main tree species. Further analysis of
   the contribution of soil properties revealed that C/N ratio being the
   most important factor in all the three study sites whereas soil pH was
   significantly related to the fungal community in two study sites.
   Functional assignment of the fungal communities indicated that 38\% of
   the observed communities were Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) and their
   distribution is significantly influenced by the forest management. Soil
   pH and C/N ratio were found to be the main drivers of the ECM fungal
   community composition. Additional fungal community similarity analysis
   revealed the presence of study site and management type specific ECM
   genera. This study extends our knowledge on the impact of forest
   management type on general and ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and
   community structure in temperate forests. High plasticity across
   management types but also study site specific spatial distribution
   revealed new insights in the ECM fungal distribution patterns.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Fungi are major players in the carbon cycle in forest ecosystems due to
   the wide range of interactions they have with plants either through soil
   degradation processes by litter decayers or biotrophic interactions with
   pathogenic and ectomycorrhizal symbionts. Secretion of fungal proteins
   mediates these interactions by allowing the fungus to interact with its
   environment and/or host. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis independently
   appeared several times throughout evolution and involves approximately
   80\% of trees. Despite extensive physiological studies on ECM symbionts,
   little is known about the composition and specificities of their
   secretomes. In this study, we used a bioinformatics pipeline to predict
   and analyze the secretomes of 49 fungal species, including 11 ECM fungi,
   wood and soil decayers and pathogenic fungi to tackle the following
   questions: (1) Are there differences between the secretomes of
   saprophytic and ECM fungi? (2) Are small-secreted proteins (SSPs) more
   abundant in biotrophic fungi than in saprophytic fungi? and (3) Are
   there SSPs shared between ECM, saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi? We
   showed that the number of predicted secreted proteins is similar in the
   surveyed species, independently of their lifestyle. The secretome from
   ECM fungi is characterized by a restricted number of secreted CAZymes,
   but their repertoires of secreted proteases and lipases are similar to
   those of saprotrophic fungi. Focusing on SSPs, we showed that the
   secretome of ECM fungi is enriched in SSPs compared with other species.
   Most of the SSPs are coded by orphan genes with no known PFAM domain or
   similarities to known sequences in databases. Finally, based on the
   clustering analysis, we identified shared- and lifestyle-specific SSPs
   between saprotrophic and ECM fungi. The presence of SSPs is not limited
   to fungi interacting with living plants as the genome of saprotrophic
   fungi also code for numerous SSPs. ECM fungi shared lifestyle specific
   SSPs likely involved in symbiosis that are good candidates for further
   functional analyses.}},

   grown with biocrusts were exposed to ambient or to CO2-enriched air
   (ambient + 350 mu mol mol(-1)) for six years. The CO2 x neighbourhood
   interaction significantly affected A. faxoniana saplings growth, soil
   microbial communities, and soil enzyme activities. Elevated CO2 had
   relatively little effect on plant and microbial biomass and phospholipid
   fatty acid (PLFA) profiles in saplings grown alone. However, increased
   ectomycorrhizal colonization was observed in the roots of these
   saplings. Results suggested that the growth of saplings grown with
   biocrusts under elevated CO2 conditions was obtained by the enhanced
   soil microbial characteristics, whereas the positive effects of elevated
   CO2 on ectomycorrhizal fungi colonization in saplings grown alone could
   not delay or alleviate the progressive nitrogen (N) limitation as is
   evidenced by similar plant biomass under elevated and ambient CO2
   treatments. In contrast, elevated CO2 significantly decreased the growth
   of A. faxoniana in the presence of dwarf bamboo, and this reduction was
   accompanied by decreased soil and leaf N concentrations, microbial
   biomass carbon (C) and N, labile C, and total PLFA. We propose that the
   depletion of the C pool and the reduction in the soil microbial
   metabolic activities in saplings grown with dwarf bamboo may limit the
   rates of decomposition to release nutrients from organic matter for
   plant growth. These results suggest that neighbouring plants have
   belowground feedback that potentially contributes to plant performance.
   On the other hand, the results of the present study also showed that the
   responses of soil organic C to elevated CO2 are different in the
   presence and absence of neighbours and dependent on neighbour identity.
   Only mesocosms with biocrust had a tendency to maintain more soil
   organic C by increased soil microbial community abundance. Our results
   also highlight the value of studying elevated CO2 effects on
   aboveground-belowground associations to improve the prediction of
   subalpine ecosystem functioning under climate changes. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Dendroctonus ponderosae has killed millions of Pinus contorta in western
   North America with subsequent effects on stand conditions, including
   changes in light intensity, needle deposition, and the composition of
   fungal community mutualists, namely ectomycorrhizal fungi. It is unknown
   whether these changes in stand conditions will have cascading
   consequences for the next generation of pine seedlings.
   To test for transgenerational cascades on pine seedlings, we tested the
   effects of fungal inoculum origin (beetle-killed or undisturbed stands),
   light intensity and litter (origin and presence) on seedling secondary
   chemistry and growth in a glasshouse. We also tracked survival of
   seedlings over two growing seasons in the same stands from which fungi
   and litter were collected.
   Fungal communities differed by inoculum origin. Seedlings grown with
   fungi collected from beetle-killed stands had lower monoterpene
   concentrations and fewer monoterpene compounds present compared with
   seedlings grown with fungi collected from undisturbed stands. Litter
   affected neither monoterpenes nor seedling growth. Seedling survival in
   the field was lower in beetle-killed than in undisturbed stands.
   We demonstrate that stand mortality caused by prior beetle attacks of
   mature pines have cascading effects on seedling secondary chemistry,
   growth and survival, probably mediated through effects on below-ground
   mutualisms.}},

Abstract = {{Plants have numerous impacts on biogeochemical cycling across both
   aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. These effects extend well beyond the
   critical role of carbon (C) fixation through photosynthesis that
   provides the basis for ecosystem energy flow. While foliar and root
   traits of senescent plant material (litter) have been explored in detail
   in terrestrial ecosystems, there is a resurgence of interest in how
   plants modulate biogeochemical cycling in ways other than litter quality
   effects on C and nutrient mineralization. This Special Feature
   represents a collection of fresh' perspectives on how plants alone, or
   in interaction with other organisms, have important and lasting impacts
   on biogeochemical cycles of C and nutrients in a range of terrestrial
   and aquatic environments. We begin in the open ocean and then peer from
   the forest edge before moving into forest understoreys and grasslands to
   examine the control by live terrestrial plants on ecosystem C and
   nutrient cycling. Plants directly affect biogeochemical cycling while
   living through their diversity and composition, nutrient capture and
   strategies for assimilating C, and by altering the microclimate for
   decomposition. In addition, how they construct their tissues and alter
   the abiotic environment has large impacts on the turnover of C and
   nutrients once plants have senesced or died. From the direct impact of
   plants, we move onto the influence of plant-insect interactions, which
   effectively determine changes in plant stoichiometry in grasslands of
   varying diversity. Finally, looking directly in the soil, it is clear
   that plant-mycorrhizae interactions are important in modulating the
   response of litter decomposition to nutrient addition and the nature of
   C metabolism in the soil.Synthesis. The papers here highlight careful
   matching between how plants live and their biotic and abiotic contexts.
   Taken together, it appears that the dynamic, rather than passive, nature
   of plant responses to variable environments is key in affecting
   ecosystem level processes of C and nutrient turnover. This Special
   Feature highlights a diversity of connections between plants and their
   environment and demonstrates that in both life and death, how plants
   respond to these changes differs among plant lineages and this diversity
   will play a central role in determining biogeochemical cycling in the
   future in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Plant nutrient acquisition in forests requires respiration by roots and

   thus reflect plant effort allocated to nutrient uptake, for example in
   conditions of different nutrient availabilities controlled by site

   and fine root biomass were measured in three sites differing in nutrient
   availability in the northern hardwood forests of the White Mountains of
   New Hampshire. Annual soil respiration and belowground C allocation
   measured in two stands at each site were lowest at Jeffers Brook, the
   site with highest nutrient availability, and higher at Hubbard Brook and
   Bartlett Experimental Forests. Neither soil respiration nor belowground
   C allocation differed significantly between mid-aged (31-41 year old)
   and older stands (> 80 year old) within the sites, despite higher fine
   root (< 1 mm) biomass in old stands than mid-aged stands. During the
   growing season, soil respiration was low where net nitrogen
   mineralization and net nitrification were high across an extensive
   sample of thirteen stands and annual belowground C allocation decreased
   with increasing nitrification across the six intensively studied stands.
   Available P was not related to soil respiration. The relationships among

Abstract = {{Forest fires are a common natural disturbance in forested ecosystems and
   have a large impact on the microbial communities in forest soils. The
   response of soil fungal communities to forest fire is poorly documented.
   Here, we investigated fungal community structure and function across a
   152-year boreal forest fire chronosequence using high-throughput
   sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region and a
   functional gene array (GeoChip). Our results demonstrate that the boreal
   forest soil fungal community was most diverse soon after a fire
   disturbance and declined over time. The differences in the fungal
   communities were explained by changes in the abundance of basidiomycetes
   and ascomycetes. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi contributed to the increase
   in basidiomycete abundance over time, with the operational taxonomic
   units (OTUs) representing the genera Cortinarius and Piloderma
   dominating in abundance. Hierarchical cluster analysis by using gene
   signal intensity revealed that the sites with different fire histories
   formed separate clusters, suggesting differences in the potential to
   maintain essential biogeochemical soil processes. The site with the
   greatest biological diversity had also the most diverse genes. The genes
   involved in organic matter degradation in the mature forest, in which
   ECM fungi were the most abundant, were as common in the youngest site,
   in which saprotrophic fungi had a relatively higher abundance. This
   study provides insight into the impact of fire disturbance on soil

Abstract = {{Soil nitrogen (N) availability constrains future predictions of
   ecosystem primary productivity and carbon storage. The progressive N
   limitation (PNL) hypothesis predicts that forest net primary
   productivity (NPP) will decline with age, and that the response of NPP
   to elevated CO2 will attenuate through time due to negative feedbacks of
   NPP on the soil N cycle. A central assumption of the PNL hypothesis is
   that, without changes in exogenous exchange of N in an ecosystem,
   increases in plant N uptake require increased soil N cycling rates.
   However, at ecosystem scale, microbial N uptake exceeds plant uptake.
   Hence, a change in the partitioning of N between plants and soil
   microorganisms may represent an alternative mechanism to sustain plant N
   uptake in the face of PNL. To estimate N partitioning of total N cycling
   between plants and microbes, we measured and modeled growth and N uptake
   of trees, bacteria, saprotrophic fungi, and ectomycorrhizal fungi across
   a forest succession and N limitation gradient. The combined plant and
   ectomycorrhizal N uptake increased from early to late succession, and
   nearly matched saprotrophic N uptake in late successional sites, while
   total N cycling remained stable or even declined. Changes in microbial
   community structure can thus mediate a redistribution of ecosystem
   nitrogen cycling, allowing an increase in plant N uptake without
   concomitant increases in soil N cycling. We further suggest that
   microbe-mediated changes in N partitioning can delay PNL and may thereby
   act as a mechanism to extend the duration of the land carbon sink in
   response to rising atmospheric CO2.}},

Abstract = {{Plant roots, their associated microbial community and free-living soil
   microbes interact to regulate the movement of carbon from the soil to
   the atmosphere, one of the most important and least understood fluxes of
   terrestrial carbon. Our inadequate understanding of how plant-microbial
   interactions alter soil carbon decomposition may lead to poor model
   predictions of terrestrial carbon feedbacks to the atmosphere. Roots,
   mycorrhizal fungi and free-living soil microbes can alter soil carbon
   decomposition through exudation of carbon into soil. Exudates of simple
   carbon compounds can increase microbial activity because microbes are
   typically carbon limited. When both roots and mycorrhizal fungi are
   present in the soil, they may additively increase carbon decomposition.
   However, when mycorrhizas are isolated from roots, they may limit soil
   carbon decomposition by competing with free-living decomposers for
   resources. We manipulated the access of roots and mycorrhizal fungi to
   soil insitu in a temperate mixed deciduous forest. We added
   C-13-labelled substrate to trace metabolized carbon in respiration and
   measured carbon-degrading microbial extracellular enzyme activity and
   soil carbon pools. We used our data in a mechanistic soil carbon
   decomposition model to simulate and compare the effects of root and
   mycorrhizal fungal presence on soil carbon dynamics over longer time
   periods. Contrary to what we predicted, root and mycorrhizal biomass did
   not interact to additively increase microbial activity and soil carbon
   degradation. The metabolism of C-13-labelled starch was highest when
   root biomass was high and mycorrhizal biomass was low. These results
   suggest that mycorrhizas may negatively interact with the free-living
   microbial community to influence soil carbon dynamics, a hypothesis
   supported by our enzyme results. Our steady-state model simulations
   suggested that root presence increased mineral-associated and
   particulate organic carbon pools, while mycorrhizal fungal presence had
   a greater influence on particulate than mineral-associated organic
   carbon pools.Synthesis. Our results suggest that the activity of enzymes
   involved in organic matter decomposition was contingent upon
   root-mycorrhizal-microbial interactions. Using our experimental data in
   a decomposition simulation model, we show that
   root-mycorrhizal-microbial interactions may have longer-term legacy
   effects on soil carbon sequestration. Overall, our study suggests that
   roots stimulate microbial activity in the short term, but contribute to
   soil carbon storage over longer periods of time.}},

Abstract = {{While it is well established that leaf litter decomposition is
   controlled by climate and substrate quality at broad spatial scales,
   conceptual frameworks that consider how local-scale factors affect
   litter decay in heterogeneous landscapes are generally lacking. A
   critical challenge in disentangling the relative impacts of and
   interactions among local-scale factors is that these factors frequently
   covary due to feedbacks between plant and soil communities. For example,
   forest plots dominated by trees that associate with ectomycorrhizal
   (ECM) fungi often differ from those dominated by trees that associate
   with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in terms of their litter quality,
   microbial community structure and inorganic nutrient availability. Here,
   we evaluate the extent to which such factors alter leaf litter
   decomposition rates. To characterize variations in decomposition rates,
   we compared decay rates of high-quality litter (maple; AM) and
   low-quality litter (oak; ECM) across forest plots representing a
   gradient in litter matrix quality and nitrogen (N) availability driven
   by the relative proportions of AM and ECM trees in each plot. In
   experiment two, we added litter from two AM and three ECM tree species
   to forest plots with either a high-quality litter matrix and high N
   availability (i.e. AM-dominated plots) or a low-quality litter matrix
   and low N availability (i.e. ECM-dominated plots). In both experiments,
   we found that AM litter decomposed more rapidly than ECM litter, and
   this effect was enhanced in AM-dominated plots. Then, to separate the
   contributions of litter matrix effects from N availability effects, we
   added N fertilizer to a subset of plots from experiment two. Nitrogen
   addition increased decay rates of high-quality litter across all sites,
   but had no effect on low-quality litter, suggesting that low N
   availability, not litter matrix quality, constrains decomposition of
   high-quality litters. Hence, N availability appears to alter litter
   decomposition patterns independently of litter matrix
   properties.Synthesis. Our results indicate that shifts in the relative
   abundance of ECM- and AM-associated trees in a plot or stand have the
   potential to affect litter decay rates through both changes in litter
   quality as well as through alterations of the local-scale soil
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Microbes such as fungi and bacteria play fundamental roles in
   litter-decay and nutrient-cycling; however, their communities may
   respond differently than plants to climate change. The structure
   (diversity, richness, and evenness) and composition of microbial
   communities in climate transects of mature Douglas-fir stands of coastal
   British Columbia rainshadow forests was analyzed, in order to assess in
   situ variability due to different temperature and moisture regimes. We
   compared denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fungi
   (18S-FF390/FR1), nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NifHuniversal) and
   ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AmoA) polymerase chain reaction amplicons in
   forest floor and mineral soil samples from three transects located at
   different latitudes, each transect spanning the Coastal Western Hemlock
   and Douglas-fir biogeoclimatic zones. Composition of microbial
   communities in both soil layers was related to degree days above 0
   degrees C (2725-3489), while pH (3.8-5.5) best explained shifts in
   community structure. At this spatial scale, climatic conditions were
   likely to directly or indirectly select for different microbial species
   while local site heterogeneity influenced community structure.
   Significant changes in microbial community composition and structure
   were related to differences as small as 2.47\% and 2.55 degrees C in
   mean annual moisture and temperature variables, respectively. The
   climatic variables best describing microbial composition changed from
   one functional group to the next; in general they did not alter
   community structure. Spatial distance, especially associated with
   latitude, was also important in accounting for community variability
   (4-23\%); but to a lesser extent than the combined influence of climate
   and soil characteristics (14-25\%). Results suggest that in situ climate
   can independently account for some patterns of microbial biogeography in
   coastal Douglas-fir forests. The distribution of up to 43\% of
   nutrientcycling microorganisms detected in forest soils responded to
   smaller abiotic gradients than host trees.}},

Abstract = {{Several laboratory experiments and field observations demonstrate that
   saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi effectively use pollen cytoplasm
   and suggest pollen produced by wind-pollinated trees as a crucial
   nutrient source for fungi and their plant hosts in nutrient-limited
   environments. However, the role of such interactions is still
   underestimated or neglected in ecology and paleoecology. Here, we
   consider pollen attacked by fungi in palynological records from Holocene
   raised peat bogs as a nutrient source for ecosystems in the past. The
   attacks occurred through the pollen germination areas by a variety of
   saprotrophic, ericoid mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal or dark septate
   endophyte fungi. Large amounts of attacked pollen in phases rich in
   Calluna vulgaris highlight the importance of Ericaceae shrubs, hosting
   ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and forming hotspots of decomposition in
   nutrient-deficit bogs. Applying estimations of pollen rain from
   literature, and based on own observed pollen infection rates we estimate
   the annual release of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium from pollen, and
   highlight their significance in pushing the ecosystem nutrient cycle in
   early spring time, when several species release their pollen. We
   highlight the significant role of anthropogenic changes in pollen
   deposition for pre-industrial bogs and hypothesize about the
   consequences of the pollen-based interrelation between wind-pollinated
   plants and their mycorrhizal fungi in paleoecology and evolution. (C)

   species composition is driven primarily by the species composition of
   living trees, while substratum properties and microclimate play minor
   roles. The terricolous saprotrophic community was determined principally
   by a litter pH gradient involving tree species composition and
   soil/litter properties. Microclimate had no concordant effect. No
   obvious underlying gradients were detected on ectomycorrhizal fungal
   species composition; however, tree size and litter pH had significant
   effects. For each group, no clear responses to landscape or management

   assemblage on the litter of each tree species was dominated by a given
   fungal species. The diversity of fungi present in the litter varied with
   the tree species although many species of fungi occurred in the litter
   of all 12 species. A Pestalotiopsis species dominated the litter fungal
   assemblage of five trees and was common in the litter of all tree
   species. The present study and earlier studies from our lab indicate
   that fungi have evolved traits such as thermotolerant spores, ability to
   utilize toxic furaldehydes, ability to produce cell wall destructuring
   enzymes and an endophyte-litter fungus life style to survive and
   establish themselves in fire-prone forests such as the one studied here.

Abstract = {{Priority effects are an important ecological force shaping biotic
   communities and ecosystem processes, in which the establishment of early
   colonists alters the colonization success of later-arriving organisms
   via competitive exclusion and habitat modification. However, we do not
   understand which biotic and abiotic conditions lead to strong priority
   effects and lasting historical contingencies. Using saprotrophic fungi
   in a model leaf decomposition system, we investigated whether
   compositional and functional consequences of initial colonization were
   dependent on initial colonizer traits, resource availability or a
   combination thereof. To test these ideas, we factorially manipulated
   leaf litter biochemistry and initial fungal colonist identity,
   quantifying subsequent community composition, using neutral genetic
   markers, and community functional characteristics, including enzyme
   potential and leaf decay rates. During the first 3months, initial
   colonist respiration rate and physiological capacity to degrade plant
   detritus were significant determinants of fungal community composition
   and leaf decay, indicating that rapid growth and lignolytic potential of
   early colonists contributed to altered trajectories of community
   assembly. Further, initial colonization on oak leaves generated
   increasingly divergent trajectories of fungal community composition and
   enzyme potential, indicating stronger initial colonizer effects on
   energy-poor substrates. Together, these observations provide evidence
   that initial colonization effects, and subsequent consequences on litter
   decay, are dependent upon substrate biochemistry and physiological
   traits within a regional species pool. Because microbial decay of plant
   detritus is important to global C storage, our results demonstrate that
   understanding the mechanisms by which initial conditions alter priority
   effects during community assembly may be key to understanding the
   drivers of ecosystem-level processes.}},

Abstract = {{A significant fraction of carbon stored in the Earth's soil moves
   through arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and ectomycorrhiza (EM). The impacts
   of AM and EM on the soil carbon budget are poorly understood. We propose
   a method to quantify the mycorrhizal contribution to carbon cycling,
   explicitly accounting for the abundance of plant-associated and
   extraradical mycorrhizal mycelium. We discuss the need to acquire
   additional data to use our method, and present our new global database
   holding information on plant species-by-site intensity of root
   colonization by mycorrhizas. We demonstrate that the degree of
   mycorrhizal fungal colonization has globally consistent patterns across
   plant species. This suggests that the level of plant species-specific
   root colonization can be used as a plant trait. To exemplify our method,
   we assessed the differential impacts of AM:EM ratio and EM shrub
   encroachment on carbon stocks in sub-arctic tundra. AM and EM affect
   tundra carbon stocks at different magnitudes, and via partly distinct
   dominant pathways: via extraradical mycelium (both EM and AM) and via
   mycorrhizal impacts on above- and belowground biomass carbon (mostly
   AM). Our method provides a powerful tool for the quantitative assessment

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment can alter N dynamics associated

   these alterations occur via microbial effects (e.g., changes in gene

   effects (e.g., changes in composition of N and C compounds). To isolate
   microbial effects from plant litter effects, we collected plant litter
   from long-term N fertilized and control plots, reciprocally inoculated
   it with microbes from the two treatments, and incubated it in a common
   field setting for three months. We used quantum dots (QDs) to track
   fungal uptake of glycine and chitosan. Glycine is a relatively simple
   organic N compound; chitosan is more complex. We found that microbial
   and litter origins each contributed to a shift in fungal uptake
   capacities under N fertilization. Specifically, N fungi preferred
   glycine over chitosan, but control fungi did not. In comparison, litter
   effects were more subtle, and manifested as a three-way interaction
   between litter origin, microbial origin, and type of organic N (glycine
   versus chitosan). In particular, control fungi tended to target chitosan
   only when incubated with control litter, while N fungi targeted glycine
   regardless of litter type. Overall, microbial effects may mediate how N
   dynamics respond to anthropogenic N enrichment in ecosystems.}},

   community-weighed traits (RCWTs) in lowland rain forests, in rubber
   agro-forests mixed with rain forest trees, in rubber and oil palm
   plantations in two landscapes (Bukit Duabelas and Harapan, Sumatra). We
   hypothesized that RCWTs vary with land use system indicating increasing

   factors found to be related to increasing transformation intensity were
   declining root vitality and root sulfur, nitrogen, carbon, manganese
   concentrations and increasing root aluminium and iron concentrations as
   well as increasing spore densities of arbuscular mycorrhizas.
   Mycorrhizal abundance was high for arbuscular and low for
   ectomycorrhizas and unrelated to changes in RCWTs. The decline in RCWTs
   showed significant correlations with soil nitrogen, soil pH and litter
   carbon. Thus, our study uncovered a relationship between deteriorating

   composition of the A.angustifolia plantation was more similar to that of
   the native forest, while the exotic Pinus or Eucalyptus plantations were
   less similar to the native forest. The conversion of native forest to

   availability, an analog to accelerated soil organic matter decomposition
   in a warming climate, could decrease plant dependency on EcM fungi and
   increase plant productivity as a result of greater carbon use
   efficiency. However, the impact of altered N and P availability on the
   growth and activity of EcM fungi in boreal forests remains poorly
   understood despite recognition of their importance to host plant
   nutrition and soil carbon sequestration. To address such uncertainty we
   examined above and belowground ecosystem properties in a boreal black
   spruce forest following five years of factorial N and P additions. By
   combining detailed soil, fungal, and plant delta N-15 measurements with
   in situ metrics of fungal biomass, growth, and activity, we found both
   expected and unexpected patterns. Soil nitrate isotope values became
   N-15 enriched in response to both N and P additions; fungal biomass was
   repressed by N yet both biomass and growth were stimulated by P; and,
   black spruce dependency on EcM derived N increased slightly when N and P
   were added alone yet significantly declined when added in combination.
   These findings contradict predictions that N fertilization would
   increase plant P demands and P fertilization would further exacerbate
   plant N demands. As a result, the prediction that EcM fungi predictably
   respond to plant N limitation was not supported. These findings
   highlight P as an under appreciated mediator of the activity of
   denitrifying bacteria, EcM fungi, and the dynamics of N cycles in boreal
   forests. Further, use of delta N-15 values from bulk soils, plants, and
   fungi to understand how EcM systems respond to changing nutrient
   availabilities will often require additional ecological information. (C)

Abstract = {{Linking community composition to ecosystem function is a challenge in
   complex microbial communities. We tested the hypothesis that key
   biological features of fungi - evolutionary history, functional guild,
   and abundance of functional genes can predict the biogeochemical
   activity of fungal species during decay. We measured the activity of 10
   different enzymes produced by 48 model fungal species on leaf litter in
   laboratory microcosms. Taxa included closely related species with
   different ecologies (i.e. species in different ``functional guilds{''})
   and species with publicly available genomes. Decomposition capabilities
   differed less among phylogenetic lineages of fungi than among different
   functional guilds. Activity of carbohydrases and acid phosphatase was
   significantly higher in litter colonized by saprotrophs compared to
   ectomycorrhizal species. By contrast, oxidoreductase activities per unit
   fungal biomass were statistically similar across functional guilds, with
   white rot fungi having highest polyphenol oxidase activity and
   ectomycorrhizal fungi having highest peroxidase activity. On the
   ecosystem level, polyphenol oxidase activity in soil correlated with the
   abundance of white rot fungi, while soil peroxidase activity correlated
   with the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in soil. Copy numbers of
   genes coding for different enzymes explained the activity of some
   tarbohydrases and polyphenol oxidase produced by fungi in culture, but
   were not significantly better predictors of activity than specific
   functional guild. Collectively, our data suggest that quantifying the
   specific functional guilds of fungi in soil, potentially through
   environmental sequencing approaches, allows us to predict activity of
   enzymes that drive soil biogeochemical cycles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Establishment of native grasses is a primary objective of restoration in
   Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum (P. \& C. Lawson) forests in the
   southwestern United States. Interactions among native grasses and soil
   microorganisms generate feedbacks that influence the achievement of this
   objective. We examined soil chemical properties and communities of
   plants and soil microorganisms in clear-cuts and P. ponderosa stands
   thinned and maintained at low and medium tree densities for over 40
   years along with high density (unthinned) stands. Phospholipid fatty
   acids (PLFA) in soils were analyzed to examine arbuscular mycorrhizal
   (AM) fungi and microbial communities in the three thinning treatments
   and the unthinned stands with and without a recent broadcast burn.
   Additionally, two native bunchgrasses, Festuca arizonica and
   Muhlenbergia wrightii were grown in containers filled with intact soil
   cores collected from each field plot to more thoroughly compare the
   abundance of AM fungi and microbial communities across different stand
   densities and burn treatments. Tree thinning decreased litter cover and
   increased the abundance and diversity and altered community composition
   of both herbaceous vegetation and AM fungi. In the mineral soil layer,
   the pH, total carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and PLFA profiles did not
   differ significantly among the four stand density or burn treatments.
   Mycorrhizal colonization of the container grown grasses did not
   significantly differ with tree density or burn treatments; however, F.
   arizonica roots had a strong trend for decreased colonization when grown
   in soil from high density (unthinned) tree cover. Soil from the
   containers with F. arizonica had a greater abundance of AM fungal
   spores. Furthermore, bacterial community composition varied with grass
   species. Concentration of biomarkers for bacteria were higher in soil
   that supported F. arizonica compared to soil in which M. wrightii was
   grown. Our results indicate that the creation of clear-cut openings in
   forests may increase the abundance and richness of AM fungal propagules
   and soil bacterial communities were surprisingly resilient to tree
   thinning and low-intensity fire treatments. These results suggest
   managing forests to create clear-cut openings generate conditions that

Abstract = {{RATIONALE: Data on the bulk stable isotope composition of soil bacteria
   and bacterivorous soil animals are required to estimate the nutrient and
   energy fluxes via bacterial channels within detrital food webs. We
   measured the isotopic composition of slime molds (Myxogastria,
   Amoebozoa), a group of soil protozoans forming macroscopic spore-bearing
   fruiting bodies. An analysis of largely bacterivorous slime molds can
   provide information on the bulk stable isotope composition of soil
   bacteria.
   METHODS: Fruiting bodies of slime molds were collected in a monsoon
   tropical forest of Cat Tien National Park, Vietnam, and analyzed by
   continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Prior to stable isotope
   analysis, carbonates were removed from a subset of samples by
   acidification. To estimate the trophic position of slime molds, their
   delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were compared with those of plant
   debris, soil, microbial destructors (litter-decomposing,
   humus-decomposing, and ectomycorrhizal fungi) and members of higher
   trophic levels (oribatid mites, termites, predatory macroinvertebrates).
   RESULTS: Eight species of slime molds represented by at least three
   independent samples were 3-6\% enriched in C-13 and N-15 relative to
   plant litter. A small but significant difference in the delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 values suggests that different species of myxomycetes can
   differ in feeding behavior. The slime molds were enriched in N-15
   compared with litter-decomposing fungi, and depleted in N-15 compared
   with mycorrhizal or humus-decomposing fungi. Slime mold sporocarps and
   plasmodia largely overlapped with oribatid mites in the isotopic
   bi-plot, but were depleted in N-15 compared with predatory invertebrates
   and humiphagous termites.
   CONCLUSIONS: A comparison with reference groups of soil organisms
   suggests strong trophic links of slime molds to saprotrophic
   microorganisms which decompose plant litter, but not to
   humus-decomposing microorganisms or to mycorrhizal fungi. Under the
   assumption that slime molds are primarily feeding on bacteria, the
   isotopic similarity of slime molds and mycophagous soil animals
   indicates that saprotrophic soil bacteria and fungi are similar in bulk
   isotopic composition. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term fertilization is being considered as a mechanism to increase
   growth of pine and spruce trees in British Columbia following a major
   outbreak of mountain pine beetle. It is important, however, that
   long-term fertilization not disrupt colonization by ectomycorrhizal
   fungi or impede their ability to release nutrients from soil organic
   matter. In order to determine the effect of long-term (up to 14 years)
   fertilization on the structure and function of ectomycorrhizal (ECM)
   fungal communities on roots of interior spruce, we characterized the ECM
   fungal community and, on separate samples collected at a different time
   of year, assayed for extracellular enzymes in the mycorrhizoplane. The
   study was conducted at three interior spruce (naturally occurring
   hybrids of Picea glauca {[}Moench] Voss and Picea engelmannii Parry)
   plantations in the interior of south-central British Columbia. Three
   0.164 ha plots per site received no (controls), periodic (200 kg ha-1 N,
   plus P, K, S, Mg, and B every 6 years), or annual (same nutrients
   adjusted to maintain foliar N concentration at 1.3\% and other nutrients
   in balance; 50 to 75 kg ha(-1) of N, depending on site and year)
   fertilization. There was no overall effect of fertilization on the
   composition of the ECM fungal community (OTUs) on spruce roots
   (permutational MANOVA P = 0.4) nor on alpha diversity per plot. At
   single sites, there was reduced relative abundance of Cortinarius spp.
   mycorrhizas under periodic fertilization, and increased relative
   abundance of Lactarius spp. or Tylospora spp. mycorrhizas under annual
   fertilization. None of the dominant genera increased or decreased
   significantly across sites. The ratio of carbon-acquiring to mineral
   nutrient-acquiring enzyme activities in the mycorrhizoplanes increased
   with frequency of fertilizer application. Increased litterfall may
   explain the increase in plant cell wall-degrading enzyme activity in
   fertilized plots. A decrease in activities involved in the release of
   sulphur was as expected in fertilized plots because the fertilizer
   contained inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. Although
   activities of two enzymes involved in nutrient cycling (sulfatase and
   phosphomonoesterase) tended to decrease, there did not appear to be an
   overall loss of organic matter-degrading potential from the ECM fungal
   community on spruce roots under long-term fertilization. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{It is proposed that carbon (C) sequestration in response to reactive
   nitrogen (N-r) deposition in boreal forests accounts for a large portion
   of the terrestrial sink for anthropogenic CO2 emissions. While studies
   have helped clarify the magnitude by which N-r deposition enhances C
   sequestration by forest vegetation, there remains a paucity of long-term
   experimental studies evaluating how soil C pools respond. We conducted a
   long-term experiment, maintained since 1996, consisting of three N
   addition levels (0, 12.5, and 50kgNha(-1)yr(-1)) in the boreal zone of
   northern Sweden to understand how atmospheric N-r deposition affects
   soil C accumulation, soil microbial communities, and soil respiration.
   We hypothesized that soil C sequestration will increase, and soil
   microbial biomass and soil respiration will decrease, with
   disproportionately large changes expected compared to low levels of N
   addition. Our data showed that the low N addition treatment caused a
   non-significant increase in the organic horizon C pool of similar to
   15\% and a significant increase of similar to 30\% in response to the
   high N treatment relative to the control. The relationship between C
   sequestration and N addition in the organic horizon was linear, with a
   slope of 10kgCkg(-1)N. We also found a concomitant decrease in total
   microbial and fungal biomasses and a similar to 11\% reduction in soil
   respiration in response to the high N treatment. Our data complement
   previous data from the same study system describing aboveground C
   sequestration, indicating a total ecosystem sequestration rate of
   26kgCkg(-1)N. These estimates are far lower than suggested by some
   previous modeling studies, and thus will help improve and validate
   current modeling efforts aimed at separating the effect of multiple
   global change factors on the C balance of the boreal region.}},

Abstract = {{A large proportion of the soil carbon (C) in boreal forests originates
   from roots and ectomycorrhizal fungi, and accurate quantification of
   fine-root litter production is needed. Methods for determination of root
   turnover have been under debate in recent years. Two recently used
   methods-radiocarbon (C-14) dating and use of minirhizotrons (MR)-have
   yielded different results. This has been attributed to analysis of
   different roots by use of these methods. At Flakaliden, northern Sweden,
   in a long-term soil warming and irrigation experiment, we compared MR
   lifespan with the C-14-derived age of fine roots from soil cores of the
   same root diameter class. We also determined the C-14-derived age of
   ingrowth core roots of Norway spruce. The median lifespan of fine roots
   around MR tubes installed 15 years previously was shorter than 2.5 years
   whereas the C-14-derived age of the fine roots from soil cores varied
   from recently grown to 14 years. Correspondingly, the age of C-14 in
   fine roots harvested from ingrowth cores installed in soil 3 months
   previously was between 1 and 20 years. Thus, cellulose in these roots
   contained older C-14 than is possible from photosynthesis during the
   time of cellulose formation. By investigating whether the age of Norway
   spruce and Scots pine seedlings was less than their root C-14-derived
   age, we tested the possibility of root C originating from soil uptake.
   This was found to be unlikely, because fine roots of four and
   eight-year-old seedlings had C-14 that was dated to be as old as or
   younger than the seedlings. We propose that further effort is required
   to identify the ecological conditions leading to root growth utilization
   of stored or recycled C.}},

Abstract = {{Focusing on Sumatra, a hotspot of tropical lowland rainforest
   transformation, we investigated effects of the conversion of rainforests
   into rubber agroforests ({''}jungle rubber{''}), intensive rubber, and
   oil palm plantations on the communities of litter and soil
   microorganisms and identified factors responsible for these changes.
   Litter basal respiration, microbial biomass, total bacterial
   phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and fungal PLFAs did not vary
   significantly with rainforest conversion. In litter of converted
   ecosystems, the concentration of certain PLFAs including the
   Gram-negative bacteria marker PLFA cy17:0 and the Gram-positive bacteria
   marker PLFA i17:0 was reduced as compared to rainforest, whereas the
   concentration of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) marker neutral
   lipid fatty acid (NLFA) 16:1 omega 5c increased. As indicated by
   redundancy analysis, litter pH and carbon concentration explained most
   of the variation in litter microbial community composition. In soil,
   microbial biomass did not vary significantly with rainforest conversion,
   whereas basal respiration declined. Total PLFAs and especially that of
   Gram-negative bacteria decreased, whereas PLFA i17:0 increased with
   rainforest conversion. The concentration of fungal PLFAs increased with
   rainforest conversion, whereas NLFA 16:1 omega 5c did not change
   significantly. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil pH explained most
   of the variation in soil microbial community composition. Overall, the
   data suggest that conversion of rainforests into production systems
   results in more pronounced changes in microbial community composition in
   soil as compared to litter. In particular, the response of fungi and
   bacteria was more pronounced in soil, while the response of AMF was more
   pronounced in litter. Notably, only certain bacterial markers but not
   those of saprotrophic fungi and AMF were detrimentally affected by
   rainforest conversion.}},

Abstract = {{Questions remain as to which soil nutrients limit primary production in
   tropical forests. Phosphorus (P) has long been considered the primary
   limiting element in lowland forests, but recent evidence demonstrates
   substantial heterogeneity in response to nutrient addition, highlighting
   a need to understand and diagnose nutrient limitation across diverse
   forests. Fine-root characteristics including their abundance, functional
   traits, and mycorrhizal symbionts can be highly responsive to changes in
   soil nutrients and may help to diagnose nutrient limitation. Here, we
   document the response of fine roots to long-term nitrogen (N), P, and
   potassium (K) fertilization in a lowland forest in Panama. Because this
   experiment has demonstrated that N and K together limit tree growth and
   P limits fine litter production, we hypothesized that fine roots would
   also respond to nutrient addition. Specifically we hypothesized that N,
   P, and K addition would reduce the biomass, diameter, tissue density,
   and mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots, and increase nutrient
   concentration in root tissue. Most morphological root traits responded
   to the single addition of K and the paired addition of N and P, with the
   greatest response to all three nutrients combined. The addition of N, P,
   and K together reduced fine-root biomass, length, and tissue density,
   and increased specific root length, whereas root diameter remained
   unchanged. Nitrogen addition did not alter root N concentration, but P
   and K addition increased root P and K concentration, respectively.
   Mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots declined with N, increased with
   P, and was unresponsive to K addition. Although plant species
   composition remains unchanged after 14 years of fertilization, fine-root
   characteristics responded to N, P, and K addition, providing some of the
   strongest stand-level responses in this experiment. Multiple soil
   nutrients regulate fine-root abundance, morphological and chemical
   traits, and their association with mycorrhizal fungi in a species-rich
   lowland tropical forest.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in plant cover after afforestation induce variations in litter
   inputs and soil microbial community structure and activity, which may
   promote the accrual and physical-chemical protection of soil organic
   carbon (SOC) within soil aggregates. In a long-term experiment (20
   years) we have studied the effects, on soil aggregation and SOC
   stabilization, of two afforestation techniques: a) amended terraces with
   organic refuse (AT), and b) terraces without organic amendment (T). We
   used the adjacent shrubland (S) as control. Twenty years after stand
   establishment, aggregate distribution (including microaggregates within
   larger aggregates), sensitive and slow organic carbon (OC) fractions,
   basal respiration in macroaggregates, and microbial community structure
   were measured. The main changes occurred in the top layer (0-5 cm),
   where: i) both the sensitive and slow OC fractions were increased in AT
   compared to S and T, ii) the percentage and OC content of
   microaggregates within macroaggregates (Mm) were higher in AT than in S
   and T, iii) basal respiration in macroaggregates was also higher in AT,
   and iv) significant changes in the fungal (rather than bacterial)
   community structure were observed in the afforested soils (AT and T) -
   compared to the shrubland soil. These results suggest that the increase
   in OC pools linked to the changes in microbial activity and fungal
   community structure, after afforestation, promoted the formation of
   macroaggregates - which acted as the nucleus for the formation and
   stabilization of OC-enriched microaggregates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report the influence of pine, oak and spruce forest
   litter on the growth and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) formation of Scots pine
   seedlings after the first growing season in a bare-root forest nursery.
   The mixture of collected forest litters and humus were used to obtain a
   20-cm mulching layer on the prepared seedbeds. The concentrations of all
   nutrients and the C/N ratio of growth media were significantly higher in
   forest litter treatments than in negative control represented by mineral
   soil without litter. Addition of each forest litter type significantly
   enhanced pine seedling height and root-collar diameter compared to
   negative control. A significant positive influence on dry mass of stem,
   needles, roots and total dry mass of the seedling has been found only
   for pine litter. Based on molecular identification, seven ECM fungal
   taxa (Wilcoxina mikolae, Suillus luteus, Cenococcum geophilum,
   Meliniomyces bicolor, Laccaria laccata, unidentified Atheliaceae,
   unidentified Ascomycetes) were distinguished in the observed mycorrhizal
   communities. Each forest litter type significantly increased the total
   number of mycorrhizal tips and ECM fungal diversity compared to the
   control soil. However, results showed a lack of significant differences
   in species composition and relative abundance of ECM fungi between
   different litter types. Such result suggests that forest litter has not
   been a key source of inoculum for tested fungal species, as root systems
   of all pine seedlings from different litter types were dominated by a
   few nursery-adapted ECM fungi, probably originating from natural
   air-borne inoculum. Our data rather indicate that forest litter
   considerably improves environmental conditions for development of ECM
   fungi previously present in the nursery soil. Therefore, any of the
   forest litter types used in our studies may be able to promote planting
   stock quality on a small scale in the nursery phase.}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis has been proposed to link plant
   photosynthesis and soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition through the
   production of fungal enzymes which promote SOM degradation and nitrogen
   (N) uptake. However, laboratory and field evidence for the existence of
   these processes are rare. Piloderma sp., a common ECM genus in boreal
   forest soil, was chosen as model mycorrhiza for this study. The
   abundance of Piloderma sp. was studied in root tips and soil over one
   growing season and in winter. Protease production was measured from
   ectomycorrhiza and soil solution in the field and pure fungal cultures.
   We also tested the effect of Piloderma olivaceum on host plant organic N
   nutrition in the laboratory. The results showed that Piloderma sp. was
   highly abundant in the field and produced extracellular proteases, which
   correlated positively with the gross primary production, temperature and
   soil respiration. In the laboratory, Piloderma olivaceum could improve
   the ability of Pinus sylvestris L. to utilize N from extragenous
   proteins. We suggest that ECM fungi, although potentially retaining N in
   their hyphae, are important in forest C and N cycling due to their
   ability to access proteinaeous N. As Piloderma sp. abundance appeared to
   be seasonally highly variable, recycling of fungal-bound N after hyphal
   death may therefore be of primary importance for the N cycling in boreal
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Nematodes of different trophic groups control distinct energy channels,
   though their exact trophic links remain little understood. Molecular
   data suggest that soil nematodes are readily consumed by a wide range of
   other soil animals, but the significance of these interactions remains
   unknown. We used stable isotope analysis to gain a better understanding
   of the trophic niches of soil nematodes in a boreal forest. We tested
   four taxonomic groups, Mononchida, Dorylaimida, Plectidae and
   Tylenchidae (mostly from the genus Filenchus), representing predators,
   omnivores, bacterivores and root-fungal feeders, respectively. To assess
   the trophic position of nematodes, we used a set of reference species
   including herbivorous, saprophagous and predatory macro-invertebrates,
   oribatid and mesostigmatid mites, and collembolans. The trophic
   positions of the investigated groups of soil nematodes generally agree
   with common knowledge. All nematodes were enriched in C-13 relative to
   Picea abies roots and litter, as well as to fungal mycelium analyzed.
   Root-fungal feeders Tylenchidae had delta N-15 values similar to those
   of earthworms, enchytraeids and Entomobrya collembolans. In contrast,
   bacterivorous Plectidae were enriched in N-15 compared to saprophagous
   macroinvertebrates and most mesofauna species. Omnivorous Dorylaimida
   and predatory Mononchida were further enriched in N-15 and their
   isotopic signature was very similar to that of predatory arthropods.
   These data confirm a clear separation of nematodes into microbial
   feeders (Tylenchidae and Plectidae) and predators (Mononchida and
   Dorylaimida). They also suggest that the trophic position of soil
   animals is largely independent of their body size, the smallest soil
   predators like nematodes occupying the same trophic level as predatory
   macro-invertebrates. Our data failed to confirm that bacterivorous or
   predatory soil nematodes are important prey for oribatid mites or
   collembolans. The patterns of isotopic signatures indicate that soil
   nematodes and the bulk of soil animals depend on resources derived from
   a dominating upper-canopy tree (P. abies) via the detrital rather than
   mycorrhizal pathway. Herbaceous plants and dwarf shrubs do not
   contribute significantly to the energy budget of soil communities in the
   boreal forest studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Distinctive plant communities may provide specific physical and chemical
   properties with soils by specific litters and root exudates to exert
   effects on soil microorganisms. Past logging activities in the Qinling
   Mountains induced diverse natural secondary forest types (NSFTs). How
   these recovered NSFTs regulate patterns of soil microbial communities
   remain limited. In the study, we used terminal-restriction fragment
   length polymorphism (T-RFLP) to precisely determine forest type-specific
   soil fungal diversity and composition in five NSFTs. Our results
   indicated that NSFTs had significant impacts on the soil fungal
   communities. The most diverse fungal species were found in the Armand
   pine (Pinus armandi) and Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) forest
   soils, followed by sharptooth oak (Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata) and
   Chinese pine-sharptooth oak forest soils, the wilson spruce (Picea
   wilsonii) forests had the lowest soil fungal diversity. The analyses of
   community composition suggested that the fungal communities of Armand
   pine forest soils were similar to those of Chinese pine forest soils,
   while other communities prominently differed from each other. Stepwise
   multiple regression analysis revealed that soil silt, clay, pH, and
   ammonium nitrogen had intimate linkages with soil fungal diversity.
   Furthermore, the patterns of soil fungal communites were strongly
   governed by the specific soil environments of the tested NSFTs, as
   described by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Finally, our study
   showed that soil fungal communities may be mediated by NSFTs via
   specific soil edaphic status. Hence, such a comparable study may provide
   fundamental information for fungal diversity and community structure of
   natural forests and assist with better prediction and understanding how

Abstract = {{Background and aims Growth, morphological traits, and mycorrhizal
   colonization of fine roots show high degree of plasticity in response to
   changes in nutrient availability, causing shifts in root
   nutrient-foraging strategy. However, little is known about how this
   plasticity associated with root branching orders respond to atmospheric
   nitrogen (N) deposition in subtropical coniferous forests.
   Methods We used soil block sampling method to examine the responses of
   six key root functional parameters (including three morphological traits
   (specific root length (SRL), root tissue density (RTD), and root
   diameter), two growth indices (total root length (TRL) and biomass) on
   an areal basis across five root orders, and ectomycorrhizal (EM) tip
   colonization) to different doses and species of N addition in a slash
   pine (Pinus elliottii) plantation in subtropical China.
   Results TRL, root biomass in all root orders, and EM tip colonization
   increased significantly with N addition. However, SRL, RTD, and root
   diameter did not change in any root orders. In comparison to low doses
   of N input, high doses of N input exerted greater effects on lower-order
   roots. In regard to species of N added, stronger responses in
   lower-order roots were observed under ammonium-based than nitrated-based
   N input. Foliar P content was significantly decreased and stoichiometric
   N:P ratio was markedly increased in response to high dose of
   ammonium-based N input.
   Conclusions Fine root growth and EM tip colonization displayed higher
   degree of plasticity than morphological traits in response to N
   addition. The plastic responses were not root-order dependent, but
   dependent on both N dose and species, especially for ephemeral
   lower-order roots that are mostly like to be the main nutrient
   acquisition structures. Our results imply that while N limitation was
   alleviated by exogenous N input, P limitation may persist or even be
   exacerbated, thus causing an increase of absorptive root length,
   biomass, and dependence on ectomycorrhizae for nutrient acquisition in
   subtropical slash pine plantation forests.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is increasingly being recognized that roots play a key role
   in soil carbon (C) dynamics, the magnitude and direction of these
   effects are unknown. Roots can accelerate soil C losses by provisioning
   microbes with energy to decompose organic matter or impede soil C losses

   reduced belowground C supply to soils via tree girdling, and contrasted
   responses in control and girdled plots for three consecutive growing
   seasons. We hypothesized that decreases in belowground C supply would
   have stronger effects in plots dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees
   rather than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees. In ECM-dominated plots,
   girdling decreased the activity of enzymes that break down soil organic
   matter (SOM) by c. 40\%, indicating that, in control plots, C supply
   from ECM roots primes microbial decomposition. In AM-dominated plots,
   girdling had little effect on SOM-degrading enzymes, but increased the
   decomposition of AM leaf litter by c. 43\%, suggesting that, in control
   plots, AM roots may intensify microbial competition for nutrients. Our
   findings indicate that root-induced changes in soil processes depend on
   forest composition, and that shifts in the distribution of AM and ECM

Abstract = {{Fertilization experiments in tropical forests have shown that litterfall
   increases in response to the addition of one or more soil nutrients.
   However, the relationship between soil nutrient availability and
   litterfall is poorly defined along natural soil fertility gradients,
   especially in tropical montane forests. Here, we measured litterfall for
   two years in five lower montane 1-ha plots spanning a soil fertility and
   precipitation gradient in lower montane forest at Fortuna, Panama.
   Litterfall was also measured in a concurrent nitrogen fertilization
   experiment at one site. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to test for
   site (or treatment), year, and season effects on vegetative,
   reproductive and total litterfall. We predicted that total litterfall,
   and the ratio of reproductive to leaf litterfall, would increase with
   nutrient availability along the fertility gradient, and in response to
   nitrogen addition. We found that total annual litterfall varied
   substantially among 1-ha plots (4.78Mg/ha/yr to 7.96Mg/ha/yr), and all
   but the most aseasonal plot showed significant seasonality in
   litterfall. However, litterfall accumulation did not track soil nutrient
   availability; instead forest growing on relatively infertile soil, but
   dominated by an ectomycorrhizal tree species, had the highest total
   litterfall accumulation. In the fertilization plots, significantly more
   total litter fell in nitrogen addition relative to control plots, but
   this increase in response to nitrogen (13\%) was small compared to
   variation observed among 1-ha plots. These results suggest that while
   litterfall at Fortuna is nutrient-limited, compositional and functional
   turnover along the fertility gradient obscure any direct relationship
   between soil resource availability and canopy productivity.
   Resumen Se demostro con experimentos de fertilizacion en bosques
   tropicales incrementos en la caida de hojarasca asociados con la adicion
   de nutrientes; empero, se desconoce la relacion entre la disponibilidad
   de nutrientes del suelo con la produccion de hojarasca en gradientes
   naturales de fertilidad del suelo, especialmente en bosques montanos
   tropicales. Medimos la produccion de hojarasca durante dos anos en cinco
   parcelas (1-ha) en bosques montanos bajos, sobre gradientes de
   fertilidad y precipitacion y en un experimento paralelo de fertilizacion
   de nitrogeno en la Reserva Forestal Fortuna, Panama. Predijimos
   incrementos de hojarasca total y reproductiva con la disponibilidad de
   nutrientes en el gradiente de fertilidad del suelo y en respuesta a la
   adicion de nitrogeno (13\%). Encontramos que la hojarasca total varia
   sustancialmente entre parcelas (4.78 Mg/ha/yr hasta 7.96 Mg/ha/yr) y que
   en todas las parcelas, excepto la menos estacional, hay estacionalidad
   significativa en la cantidad de hojarasca; pero, la acumulacion de
   hojarasca no coincide con la disponibilidad de nutrientes en el suelo,
   porque el bosque sobre suelo poco fertil con dominio de una especie
   ectomicorricica, presento mayor acumulacion de hojarasca. Las parcelas
   con fertilizacion tenian significativamente mas hojarasca que las
   control; pero, el incremento en hojarasca en respuesta a la adicion de
   nitrogeno fue menor respecto a la variacion entre parcelas. Los
   resultados sugieren que mientras la produccion de hojarasca en Fortuna
   es limitada por nutrientes, la variacion en la composicion de especies a
   traves de gradientes de fertilidad ocultan cualquier relacion directa
   entre la disponibilidad de nutrientes del suelo y la productividad del

Abstract = {{Climate warming at high northern latitudes has caused substantial
   increases in plant productivity of tundra vegetation and an expansion of
   the range of deciduous shrub species. However significant the increase
   in carbon (C) contained within above-ground shrub biomass, it is modest
   in comparison with the amount of C stored in the soil in tundra
   ecosystems. Here, we use a space-for-time' approach to test the
   hypothesis that a shift from lower-productivity tundra heath to
   higher-productivity deciduous shrub vegetation in the sub-Arctic may
   lead to a loss of soil C that out-weighs the increase in above-ground
   shrub biomass. We further hypothesize that a shift from ericoid to
   ectomycorrhizal systems coincident with this vegetation change provides
   a mechanism for the loss of soil C. We sampled soil C stocks, soil
   surface CO2 flux rates and fungal growth rates along replicated natural
   transitions from birch forest (Betula pubescens), through deciduous
   shrub tundra (Betula nana) to tundra heaths (Empetrum nigrum) near
   Abisko, Swedish Lapland. We demonstrate that organic horizon soil
   organic C (SOCorg) is significantly lower at shrub (2.98 +/-
   0.48kgm(-2)) and forest (2.04 +/- 0.25kgm(-2)) plots than at heath plots
   (7.03 +/- 0.79kgm(-2)). Shrub vegetation had the highest respiration
   rates, suggesting that despite higher rates of C assimilation, C
   turnover was also very high and less C is sequestered in the ecosystem.
   Growth rates of fungal hyphae increased across the transition from heath
   to shrub, suggesting that the action of ectomycorrhizal symbionts in the
   scavenging of organically bound nutrients is an important pathway by
   which soil C is made available to microbial degradation. The expansion
   of deciduous shrubs onto potentially vulnerable arctic soils with large
   stores of C could therefore represent a significant positive feedback to
   the climate system.}},

Abstract = {{Human land use alters soil microbial composition and function in a
   variety of systems, although few comparable studies have been done in
   tropical forests and tropical agricultural production areas. Logging and
   the expansion of oil palm agriculture are two of the most significant
   drivers of tropical deforestation, and the latter is most prevalent in
   Southeast Asia. The aim of this study was to compare soil fungal
   communities from three sites in Malaysia that represent three of the
   most dominant land-use types in the Southeast Asia tropics: a primary
   forest, a regenerating forest that had been selectively logged 50 years
   previously, and a 25-year-old oil palm plantation. Soil cores were
   collected from three replicate plots at each site, and fungal
   communities were sequenced using the Illumina platform. Extracellular
   enzyme assays were assessed as a proxy for soil microbial function. We
   found that fungal communities were distinct across all sites, although
   fungal composition in the regenerating forest was more similar to the
   primary forest than either forest community was to the oil palm site.
   Ectomycorrhizal fungi, which are important associates of the dominant
   Dipterocarpaceae tree family in this region, were compositionally
   distinct across forests, but were nearly absent from oil palm soils.
   Extracellular enzyme assays indicated that the soil ecosystem in oil
   palm plantations experienced altered nutrient cycling dynamics, but
   there were few differences between regenerating and primary forest
   soils. Together, these results show that logging and the replacement of
   primary forest with oil palm plantations alter fungal community and
   function, although forests regenerating from logging had more
   similarities with primary forests in terms of fungal composition and
   nutrient cycling potential. Since oil palm agriculture is currently the
   mostly rapidly expanding equatorial crop and logging is pervasive across
   tropical ecosystems, these findings may have broad applicability.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem-level consequences of biodiversity loss of macroorganisms are
   well understood, while the repercussions of species extirpation in
   microbial systems are not. We manipulated species richness and
   phylogenetic relatedness of saprotrophic fungi in situ in a boreal
   forest to address this issue. Litter decomposition rates (as total mass
   loss) after 2 months were significantly higher in the least
   phylogenetically related fungal assemblages. Likewise, cellulose loss
   was also highest in the most distantly related treatments after 1 year.
   There were marginal effects of species richness on mass loss that only
   affected decomposition after 2 months. At the end of 1 year of
   decomposition, most fungal communities had collapsed from their original
   diversity to two species, mainly in the Penicillium or Hypocrea clades.
   Two concurrent processes may explain these results: competition between
   closely related fungal taxa and phylogenetic conservation in cellulose
   decomposition. Our results suggest that phylogenetic relatedness of
   fungal communities may be a more appropriate metric than species
   richness or community composition to predict functional responses of
   fungal communities to global change.}},

Volume = {{69}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The relative amounts of hyphal inoculum in forest soils may determine
   the capacity for fungi to compete with and replace early colonizers of
   wood in ground contact. Our aim in this study was to test the
   flexibility of priority effects (colonization timing) by varying the
   timing of inoculum introduction (i.e., precolonization) and amount of
   inoculum (i.e., inoculum potential). We controlled these variables in
   soil-block microcosms using fungi with known competitive outcomes in
   similar conditions, tracking isolate-specific fungal biomass, and
   residue physiochemistry over time. In the precolonization trial
   (experiment I), a brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum was given 1, 3,
   or 5 weeks to precolonize wood blocks (oak, birch, pine, and spruce)
   prior the introduction of a white rot fungus, Irpex lacteus, a more
   aggressive colonizer in this set-up. In the inoculum potential trial
   (experiment II), the fungi were inoculated simultaneously, but with
   eightfold higher brown rot inoculum than that of experiment I. As
   expected, longer precolonization duration increased the chance for the
   less-competitive brown rot fungus to outcompete its white rot opponent.
   Higher brown rot fungal inoculum outside of the wood matrix also
   resulted in competitive success for the brown rot isolate in most cases.
   These temporal shifts in fungal dominance were detectable in a
   `community snapshot' as isolate-specific quantitative PCR, but also as
   functionally-relevant consequences of wood rot type, including
   carbohydrate depolymerization and pH. These results from a controlled
   system reinforce fungal-fungal interaction and suggest that relative
   inoculum availability beyond the wood matrix (i.e., soils) might
   regulate the duration of priority effects and shift the functional
   trajectory of wood decomposition.}},

Pages = {{53-64}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In forest ecosystems, trees represent the major primary producers and
   affect the chemical composition and microbial processes in the ecosystem
   via specific litter chemistry and rhizodeposition. Effects of trees on
   the abundance of soil microorganisms have been previously observed but
   the extent to which trees affect the composition of microbial
   communities remains unknown. Here we analyse the factors affecting the
   composition of bacterial and fungal communities in forest litter and
   soil under seven tree species studied at twenty-eight spatially
   independent sites of similar age developed on the same initial
   substrate. Microbial communities differed between litter and soil.
   Bacterial communities were more diverse than fungal communities,
   especially in litter, and exhibited higher evenness. Eighty percent of
   the bacterial sequences belonged to the 200-250 most dominant
   operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and 80\% of the fungal sequences
   were composed of only 23-28 OTUs. The effect of tree species on the
   microbial-community composition was significant in both litter and soil
   for fungi as well as bacteria. In bacteria, the tree effect was likely
   partly mediated by litter and soil pH. Fungal taxa showed a greater
   tendency to be tree-specific: 35-37\% of the dominant fungal OTUs but
   only 0-3\% of the bacterial OTUs were restricted to 1 or 2 trees, and
   15-45\% of the fungi and 80\% of the bacteria were common under 6 or 7
   trees. Microbial taxa were demonstrated to associate with less trees
   than would be expected based on the patterns of their abundance in
   samples and the tree identity thus affects their occurrence. The numbers
   of observed dominant fungal OTUs in the study area increased faster with
   an increasing numbers of trees, indicating high beta-diversity. Although
   the proportion of the arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi
   differed among trees, the tree-specific fungal taxa were both
   root-symbiotic and saprotrophic. The effect of trees on the composition
   of microbial community was demonstrated to be stronger than other soil
   properties and to explain a large proportion of variation in community
   composition, especially in fungi. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Despite its importance to energy flow and nutrient cycling the process
   of fine root decomposition has received comparatively little detailed
   research. Disruption of the fine root-soil interface during preparation
   of root litterbags for decomposition studies could affect decay rates
   and nutrient mobilization in part by altering the community of decay
   organisms. We compared rates of decomposition and nutrient release from
   fine roots of pine between litterbags and intact cores and characterized
   the fungal community in the decomposing roots. Fine root decomposition
   was about twice as fast overall for intact cores than litterbags, and
   rapid mobilization of N and P was observed for roots in cores whereas
   nutrients were immobilized in litterbags. Fungal communities
   characterized using 454 pyrosequencing were considerably different
   between decaying roots in intact cores and litterbags. Most interesting,
   taxa from ectomycorrhizal fungal orders such as Boletales, Thelephorales
   and Cantharellales appeared to be more common in decaying roots from
   cores than litterbags. Moreover, the rate of N and P mobilization from
   decaying fine roots was highly correlated with taxa from two orders of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi (Thelephorales, Cantharellales). Although we
   caution that DNA identified from the decaying roots cannot be
   conclusively ascribed to active fungi, the results provide tentative
   support for a significant role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in decomposition

Abstract = {{Hyperdiverse forests occur in the lowland tropics, whereas the most
   species-rich shrublands are found in regions such as south-western
   Australia (kwongan) and South Africa (fynbos). Despite large
   differences, these ecosystems share an important characteristic: their
   soils are strongly weathered and phosphorus (P) is a key growth-limiting
   nutrient. Soil-borne pathogens are increasingly being recognized as
   drivers of plant diversity in lowland tropical rainforests, but have
   received little attention in species-rich shrublands. We suggest a
   trade-off in which the species most proficient at acquiring P have
   ephemeral roots that are particularly susceptible to soil-borne
   pathogens. This could equalize out the differences in competitive
   ability among co-occurring species in these ecosystems, thus
   contributing to coexistence. Moreover, effective protection against
   soil-borne pathogens by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi might explain the
   occurrence of monodominant stands of ECM trees and shrubs amongst
   otherwise species-rich communities. We identify gaps in our knowledge
   which need to be filled in order to evaluate a possible link between P
   limitation, fine root traits, soil-borne pathogens and local plant
   species diversity. Such a link may help to explain how numerous plant
   species can coexist in hyperdiverse rainforests and shrublands, and,
   conversely, how monodominant stands can develop in these ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Soil horizons below 30 cm depth contain about 60\% of the organic carbon
   stored in soils. Although insight into the physical and chemical
   stabilization of soil organic matter (SUM) and into microbial community
   composition in these horizons is being gained, information on microbial
   functions of subsoil microbial communities and on associated
   microbially-mediated processes remains sparse. To identify possible
   controls on enzyme patterns, we correlated enzyme patterns with biotic
   and abiotic soil parameters, as well as with microbial community
   composition, estimated using phospholipid fatty acid profiles. Enzyme
   patterns (i.e. distance-matrixes calculated from these enzyme
   activities) were calculated from the activities of six extracellular
   enzymes (cellobiohydrolase, leucine-amino-peptidase,
   N-acetylglucosaminidase, chitotriosidase, phosphatase and
   phenoloxidase), which had been measured in soil samples from organic
   topsoil horizons, mineral topsoil horizons, and mineral subsoil horizons
   from seven ecosystems along a 1500 km latitudinal transect in Western
   Siberia. We found that hydrolytic enzyme activities decreased rapidly
   with depth, whereas oxidative enzyme activities in mineral horizons were
   as high as, or higher than in organic topsoil horizons. Enzyme patterns
   varied more strongly between ecosystems in mineral subsoil horizons than
   in organic topsoils. The enzyme patterns in topsoil horizons were
   correlated with SUM content (i.e., C and N content) and microbial
   community composition. In contrast, the enzyme patterns in mineral
   subsoil horizons were related to water content, soil pH and microbial
   community composition. The lack of correlation between enzyme patterns
   and SUM quantity in the mineral subsoils suggests that SOM chemistry,
   spatial separation or physical stabilization of SUM rather than SUM
   content might determine substrate availability for enzymatic breakdown.
   The correlation of microbial community composition and enzyme patterns
   in all horizons, suggests that microbial community composition shapes
   enzyme patterns and might act as a modifier for the usual dependency of
   decomposition rates on SUM content or C/N ratios. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{142-149}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{According to the economy theory, plants should preferentially allocate
   photosynthate to acquire below-ground resources under elevated
   atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) but decrease below-ground C
   allocation when nitrogen (N) is sufficient for plant growth. Arbuscular
   mycorrhizae (AM) represent a critical mechanism of below-ground nutrient
   acquisition for plants. The dynamics of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   (AMF) could therefore reflect the response of plant C allocation under
   eCO(2) and N addition. We examined the responses of glomalin-related
   soil protein (GRSP) to eCO(2) (approximately 700 mu mol mol(-1) CO2)
   and/or N addition (100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) as NH4NO3) in a modeled
   subtropical forest to better understand its potential influence on soil
   C storage. We hypothesized that GRSP would increase under eCO(2) and
   decrease under N addition. Furthermore, the positive effects of eCO(2)
   on GRSP would be offset by extra N addition, and GRSP would remain
   unchanged under combined eCO(2) and N addition. Our results showed that
   the mean concentrations of easily extractable GRSP (EE-GRSP) and total
   GRSP (T-GRSP) were 0.35 +/- 0.05 and 0.72 +/- 0.13 mg C cm(-3),
   respectively, which accounted for 2.76 +/- 0.53\% and 5.67 +/- 0.92\% of
   soil organic carbon (SOC) in the 0-10 cm soil layer. Elevated CO2
   significantly increased T-GRSP by 35.02\% but decreased EE-GRSP by
   5.09\% in the top 10 cm soil layer. The opposite responses of T-GRSP and
   EE-GRSP to eCO(2) might result from an unchanged photosynthate
   investment to AMF with possible changes in their decomposition rates.
   The effect of N on GRSP was contrary to our hypothesis, i.e., there was
   a 1.72\%-48.49\% increase in T-GRSP and a slightly increase in EE-GRSP.
   Both EE-GRSP and T-GRSP concentrations increased under the combination
   of eCO(2) and N addition, which was inconsistent with our hypothesis.
   The significant increase of EE-GRSP under the combination of eCO(2) and
   N addition was partly caused by more rapid plant growth and reduced
   microbial diversity, and the marginal increase of T-GRSP indicated that
   the interaction between eCO(2) and N addition offset their independent
   effects. In addition, the relatively higher accumulation ratios of GRSP
   (22.6 +/- 13.6\%) compared with SOC (15.9 +/- 9.4\%) indicated that more
   rapid GRSP deposition in the soil might accelerate SOC accumulation
   under eCO(2) and N addition. Our results will improve the understanding
   of the functioning of GRSP in soil C sequestration under global
   environmental change scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Fungal communities in Norway spruce (Picea abies) logs in two forests in
   Sweden were investigated by 454-sequence analyses and by examining the
   ecological roles of the detected taxa. We also investigated the
   relationship between fruit bodies and mycelia in wood and whether
   community assembly was affected by how the dead wood was formed. Fungal
   communities were highly variable in terms of phylogenetic composition
   and ecological roles: 1910 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
   were detected; 21\% were identified to species level. In total, 58\% of
   the OTUs were ascomycetes and 31\% basidiomycetes. Of the 231 337 reads,
   38\% were ascomycetes and 60\% basidiomycetes. Ecological roles were
   assigned to 35\% of the OTUs, accounting for 62\% of the reads.
   Wood-decaying fungi were the most common group; however, other
   saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, lichenized, parasitic and endophytic fungi
   were also common. Fungal communities in logs formed by stem breakage
   were different to those in logs originating from butt breakage or

   has not yet been fully acknowledged as an important factor in the
   regulation of soil carbon (C) storage. Here, we review recent findings,
   which support the view that some ectomycorrhizal fungi have the capacity
   to oxidize organic matter, either by brown-rot' Fenton chemistry or
   using white-rot' peroxidases. We propose that ectomycorrhizal fungi
   benefit from organic matter decomposition primarily through increased
   nitrogen mobilization rather than through release of metabolic C and
   question the view that ectomycorrhizal fungi may act as facultative
   saprotrophs. Finally, we discuss how mycorrhizal decomposition may
   influence organic matter storage in soils and mediate responses of
   ecosystem C sequestration to environmental changes.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal forest soils store a major proportion of the global terrestrial
   carbon (C) and below-ground inputs contribute as much as above-ground
   plant litter to the total C stored in the soil. A better understanding
   of the dynamics and drivers of root-associated fungal communities is
   essential to predict long-term soil C storage and climate feedbacks in
   northern ecosystems. We used 454-pyrosequencing to identify fungal
   communities across fine-scaled soil profiles in a 5000yr fire-driven
   boreal forest chronosequence, with the aim of pinpointing shifts in
   fungal community composition that may underlie variation in below-ground
   C sequestration. In early successional-stage forests, higher abundance
   of cord-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi (such as Cortinarius and Suillus
   species) was linked to rapid turnover of mycelial biomass and necromass,
   efficient nitrogen (N) mobilization and low C sequestration. In late
   successional-stage forests, cord formers declined, while ericoid
   mycorrhizal ascomycetes continued to dominate, potentially facilitating
   long-term humus build-up through production of melanized hyphae that
   resist decomposition. Our results suggest that cord-forming
   ectomycorrhizal fungi and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi play opposing roles
   in below-ground C storage. We postulate that, by affecting turnover and
   decomposition of fungal tissues, mycorrhizal fungal identity and growth
   form are critical determinants of C and N sequestration in boreal
   forests.

Abstract = {{Eucalyptus obliqua, the most widespread timber tree in Tasmania, is a
   pioneer after fire which can eliminate the organic layer of forest soil,
   exposing the underlying mineral soil. We compared seedling growth,
   mycorrhiza formation, and mineral nutrient limitation in organic layer
   vs. mineral soil. We grew E. obliqua seedlings separately in pots of
   organic layer and mineral soil in a glasshouse. Additional treatments of
   organic soil only, involved fully crossed methyl-bromide fumigation and
   fertilization. Fertilization comprised chelated iron for 121 days after
   transplant (DAT) followed by soluble phosphorus. At 357 DAT, whole plant
   dry weight was three times greater in ambient organic than in mineral
   soil. In organic soil, fumigation halved ectomycorrhiza abundance and
   reduced seedling growth at 149 DAT, but by 357 DAT when negative effects
   of fumigation on seedling growth had disappeared, neither fumigation nor
   fertilization affected mycorrhiza abundance. Iron fertilization
   diminished seedling growth, but subsequent phosphorus fertilization
   improved it. E. obliqua seedlings grow much better in organic layer soil
   than in mineral soil, although phosphorus remains limiting. The
   prevalent forestry practice of burning to mineral soil after timber
   harvest exposes a poor growth medium likely only partially compensated
   by fire-induced mineral soil alterations}},

Abstract = {{The decomposition of plant organic matter and the stability of soil
   aggregates are important components of soil carbon cycling, and the
   relationship between decomposition rate and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   (AMF) has recently received considerable attention. The interaction of
   AMF with their associated microorganisms and the consequences for litter
   decomposition and soil aggregation still remain fairly unclear. In a
   laboratory pot experiment we simultaneously tested the single and
   combined effects of one AMF species (Rhizophagus irregularis) and a
   natural non-AMF microbial community on the decomposition of small wooden
   sticks and on soil aggregation. To disentangle effects of hyphae and
   roots we placed mesh bags as root exclusion compartments in the soil.
   The decomposition of the wooden sticks in this compartment was
   significantly reduced in the presence of AMF, but not with the non-AMF
   microbial community only, compared to the control, while aggregation was
   increased in all treatments compared to the control. We suggest that AMF
   directly (via localized nutrient removal or altered moisture conditions)
   or indirectly (by providing an alternative carbon source) inhibited the
   activity of decomposers, leading to different levels of plant litter
   degradation under our experimental settings. Reduced decomposition of
   woody litter in presence of AMF can be important for nutrient cycling in
   AMF-dominated forests and in the case of woody plants and perennials
   that develop lignified roots in grasslands. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Forests around the world are increasingly fragmented, and edge effects
   on forest microclimates have the potential to affect ecosystem functions
   such as carbon and nutrient cycling. Edges tend to be drier and warmer
   due to the effects of insolation, wind, and evapotranspiration and these
   gradients can penetrate hundreds of metres into the forest. Litter
   decomposition is a key component of the carbon cycle, which is largely
   controlled by saprotrophic fungi that respond to variation in
   temperature and moisture. However, the impact of forest fragmentation on
   litter decay is poorly understood. Here, we investigate edge effects on
   the decay of wood in a temperate forest using an experimental approach,
   whereby mass loss in wood blocks placed along 100m transects from the
   forest edge to core was monitored over 2years. Decomposition rate
   increased with distance from the edge, and was correlated with
   increasing humidity and moisture content of the decaying wood, such that
   the decay constant at 100m was nearly twice that at the edge. Mean air
   temperature decreased slightly with distance from the edge. The
   variation in decay constant due to edge effects was larger than that
   expected from any reasonable estimates of climatic variation, based on a
   published regional model. We modelled the influence of edge effects on
   the decay constant at the landscape scale using functions for forest
   area within different distances from edge across the UK. We found that
   taking edge effects into account would decrease the decay rate by nearly
   one quarter, compared with estimates that assumed no edge effect.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, root production accounts for 33-67\% of terrestrial net
   primary productivity and influences decomposition via root production
   and turnover, carbon (C) allocation to mycorrhizal fungi and root

   affects terrestrial C balance, yet there is no parallel understanding
   for below-ground phenology. In this paper we examine the phenology of
   root production and its relationship to temperature, soil moisture, and
   above-ground phenology. Synthesizing 87 observations of whole-plant
   phenology from 40 studies, we found that, on average, root growth occurs
   25 +/- 8d after shoot growth but that the offset between the peak in

   precipitation in boreal, temperate, and subtropical biomes. However, a
   temperature hysteresis in these biomes leads to the hypothesis that

Abstract = {{This study aimed to determine the influence of tree species on soil
   microbial community structure.
   We conducted a litter and root manipulation and a short-term nitrogen
   (N) addition experiment in 19-year-old broadleaf Mytilaria laosensis
   (Hamamelidaceae) and coniferous Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata)
   plantations in subtropical China. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA)
   analysis was used to examine treatment effects on soil microbial
   community structure. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to
   determine the relationships between individual PLFAs and soil properties
   (soil pH, carbon (C) and N concentration and C:N ratio).
   Soil C:N ratio was significantly greater in M. laosensis (17.9) than in
   C. lanceolata (16.2). Soil C:N ratio was the key factor affecting the
   soil microbial community regardless of tree species and the litter, root
   and N treatments at our study site. The fungal biomarkers, 18:1 omega 9
   and 18:2 omega 6,9 were significantly and positively related to soil C:N
   ratio and the abundance of bacterial lipid biomarkers was negatively
   related to soil C:N ratio. N addition for 8 months did not change the
   biomass and structure of the microbial community in M. laosensis and C.
   lanceolata soils. Soil nutrient availability before N addition was an
   important factor in determining the effect of N fertilization on soil
   microbial biomass and activity. PLFA analysis showed that root exclusion
   significantly decreased the abundance of the fungal biomarkers and
   increased the abundance of the Gram-positive bacteria. Rootless plots
   had a relatively lower Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria ratio and
   a higher fungi to bacteria ratio compared to the plots with roots under
   both M. laosensis and C. lanceolata. The response of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (16:1 omega 5) to root exclusion was species-specific.
   These observations suggest that soil C:N ratio was an important factor
   in influencing soil microbial community structure. Further studies are
   required to confirm the long-term effect of tree species on soil
   microbial community structure.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the possible effects of tree species diversity
   and identity on the soil microbial community in a species-rich temperate
   broad-leaved forest. For the first time, we separated the effects of
   tree identity and tree species diversity on the link between above and
   belowground communities in a near-natural forest. We established 100
   tree clusters consisting of each three tree individuals represented by
   beech (Fagus sylvatica L), ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), hornbeam
   (Carpinus betulus L), maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), or lime (Tilia
   spec.) at two different sites in the Hainich National Park (Thuringia,
   Germany). The tree clusters included one, two or three species forming a
   diversity gradient. We investigated the microbial community structure,
   using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles, in mineral soil samples
   (0-10 cm) collected in the centre of each cluster.
   The lowest total PLFA amounts were found in the pure beech clusters
   (79.0 +/- 23.5 nmol g(-1) soil dw), the highest PLFA amounts existed in
   the pure ash clusters (287.3 +/- 211.3 nmol g(-1) soil dw). Using
   principle components analyses (PCA) and redundancy analyses (RDA), we
   found only for the variables `relative proportion of beech trees' and
   `living lime fine root tips associated with ectomycorrhiza' a
   significant effect on the PLFA composition. The microbial community
   structure was mainly determined by abiotic environmental parameters such
   as soil pH or clay content. The different species richness levels in the
   clusters did not significantly differ in their total PLFA amounts and
   their PLFA composition. We observed a tendency that the PLFA profiles of
   the microbial communities in more tree species-rich clusters were less
   influenced by individual PLFAs (more homogenous) than those from
   species-poor clusters.
   We concluded that tree species identity and site conditions were more
   important factors determining the soil microbial community structure
   than tree species diversity per se. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Detritivorous soil invertebrates process large quantities of leaf litter
   material. Focusing on decomposer (Oribatida) and predatory mites
   (Mesostigmata) we investigated the incorporation of resources from leaf
   litter rich (European beech, Fagus sylvatica) and poor (European ash,
   Fraxinus excelsior) in structural compounds using stable isotopes. Using
   litter mixtures we investigated if soil mites preferentially incorporate
   carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) derived from beech or ash leaf litter. Using
   the rotated-core method we established treatments with and without
   mycorrhiza as interactions between mycorrhiza and saprotrophic
   microorganisms may alter the availability of litter resources to soil
   invertebrates. Conform to our expectations primary decomposers
   incorporated more C and N than secondary decomposers or predators, but
   the contribution to body tissue element concentration was low suggesting
   that they predominantly rely on other resources than litter from the
   previous year. Generally, soil mites incorporated more C and N from ash
   than from beech litter, but this was less pronounced after 10 as
   compared to after 5 months, presumably due to fast decomposition of ash
   litter. In contrast to our expectations the use of litter resources by
   soil mites was little affected by mycorrhiza. Overall, the results
   underline that, at least during the first year of litter decay, leaf
   litter resources are of minor importance for soil mite nutrition, and
   this is particularly true for litter rich in structural compounds such
   as beech. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal forest soil contains significant amounts of organic carbon. Soil
   disturbance, caused for example by site preparation or stump extraction,
   may increase decomposition and thus lead to higher CO2 emissions,
   contributing to global warming. The aim of this study was to quantify
   responses of soil-surface CO2 fluxes (R-s) and litter (needle and root)
   decomposition rates following various kinds of soil disturbance commonly
   caused by mechanical site preparation and stump harvest. For this
   purpose four treatments were applied in a clear-cut site in central
   Sweden: i) removal of the humus layer and top 2 cm of mineral soil, ii)
   placement of a humus layer and 2 cm of mineral soil upside down on top
   of undisturbed soil, forming a double humus layer buried under mineral
   soil, iii) heavy mixing of the humus layer and mineral soil, and iv) no
   disturbance (control). Rs measurements were acquired with a portable
   respiration system during two growing seasons. To assess the treatments'
   effects on litter decomposition rates, needles or coarse roots (empty
   set = 6 mm) were incubated in litterbags at positions they would be
   located after the treatments (buried, or on top of the soil). The
   results indicate that site preparation-simulating treatments have no
   effect or may significantly reduce, rather than increase, CO2 emissions
   during the following two years. They also show that buried litter
   decomposes more rapidly than litter on the surface, but in other
   respects the treatments have little effect on litter decomposition
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{We studies the seasonal dynamics of phenolics in leaves, litter and soil
   of the dominant host tree oak (Quercus robur L.) growing with
   ectomycorrhizal fungi truffles (T. macrosporum) in oak forest (Fraxino
   angustifoliae-Quercetum roboris Joy. et Tomic 1979) near River Danube,
   near Belgrade. In litter, the highest content of free phenolics was in
   April (primordial growth period of truffles) and bound phenolics in
   August (truffles ripening- start of harvest). Due to intensive
   decomposition of forest litter during the vegetative growth period, free
   phenolic acids increased and the bound phenolic acids decreased. There
   was reduction in ratio of bound cinnamic to benzoic acids, it indicated
   the microbial degradation of lignin and the transformation of cinnamic
   derivatives into benzoic acid derivatives. In the top soil layer, where
   the majority of truffle fruit bodies were found (28.31 kg/ha/year). the
   free phenolics (direct influence on truffle growth and development)
   contents were up to 58.36 mu g/g. As the mycelia and fruit bodies of
   truffle grow in phenolic-rich forest soil, hence, we assumed that the
   truffle is well-adapted to high phenolics content.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) is a limiting nutrient for the productivity of many
   agroecosystems, and the depletion of global mineral P reserves is of
   concern for global food security. On the other hand, overfertilization
   with P and its subsequent export through runoff can cause eutrophication
   of water bodies and natural terrestrial habitats. An important challenge
   is therefore to develop productive farming systems in which P
   availability in soils is increased, while reducing mineral P inputs,
   outputs, and negative off-site impacts.
   Increasing the P availability in cropping systems requires several
   approaches including management of soil properties and P amendments,
   agroecology of cropping systems, and plant breeding. The objective of
   the present review is to identify new research perspectives in agronomy
   and emerging strategies to improve the P availability in cropping
   systems. For this purpose, we explore the following: (1) the use of
   renewable waste-derived P resources (including crop residues, excreta,
   struvite, and biochar) to improve P availability, particularly the
   impacts of applications of such renewable P sources on the chemical
   properties of the soil, soil organic matter dynamics, soil microbial and
   rhizospheric activity, and, ultimately, P availability; (2) the effects
   of multispecies cropping system on P availability, notably the
   incorporation of the concepts of positive plantesoil feedback on P
   availability, previously demonstrated in grassland and forest
   ecosystems, to multispecies cropping systems; and (3) the identification
   of genetic traits of plantemicroorganism relations involved in the
   tolerance of low-P soils to improve plant breeding outcomes.
   The challenge for sustainable management of P resources for agriculture
   is now to reengineer agricultural systems at several scales and to
   define P management strategies in cropping systems by combining the use
   of renewable P resources and the management of soil properties,
   multispecies cropping system, and crop cultivars that increase soil P
   availability.}},

Title = {{Neglected role of fungal community composition in explaining variation
   in wood decay rates}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{124-133}},

Abstract = {{Decomposition of wood is an important component of global carbon
   cycling. Most wood decomposition models are based on tree
   characteristics and environmental conditions; however, they do not
   include community dynamics of fungi that are the major wood decomposers.
   We examined the factors explaining variation in sapwood decay in oak
   tree stumps two and five years after cutting. Wood moisture content was
   significantly correlated with sapwood decay in younger stumps, whereas
   ITS-based composition and species richness of the fungal community were
   the best predictors for mass loss in the older stumps. Co-occurrence
   analysis showed that, in freshly cut trees and in younger stumps, fungal
   communities were nonrandomly structured, whereas fungal communities in
   old stumps could not be separated from a randomly assembled community.
   These results indicate that the most important factors explaining
   variation in wood decay rates can change over time and that the strength
   of competitive interactions between fungi in decaying tree stumps may
   level off with increased wood decay. Our field analysis further suggests
   that ascomycetes may have a prominent role in wood decay, but their
   wood-degrading abilities need to be further tested under controlled
   conditions. The next challenging step will be to integrate fungal
   community assembly processes in wood decay models to improve carbon
   sequestration estimates of forests.}},

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal (EcM)-mediated nitrogen (N) acquisition is one main
   strategy used by terrestrial plants to facilitate growth. Measurements
   of natural abundance nitrogen isotope ratios (denoted as N-15 relative
   to a standard) increasingly serve as integrative proxies for
   mycorrhiza-mediated N acquisition due to biological fractionation
   processes that alter N-15:N-14 ratios. Current understanding of these
   processes is based on studies from high-latitude ecosystems where plant
   productivity is largely limited by N availability. Much less is known
   about the cause and utility of ecosystem N-15 patterns in the tropics.
   Using structural equation models, model selection and isotope mass
   balance we assessed relationships among co-occurring soil, mycorrhizal
   plants and fungal N pools measured from 40 high- and 9 low-latitude
   ecosystems. At low latitudes N-15-enrichment caused ecosystem components
   to significantly deviate from those in higher latitudes. Collectively,
   N-15 patterns suggested reduced N-dependency and unique sources of EcM
   N-15-enrichment under conditions of high N availability typical of the
   tropics. Understanding the role of mycorrhizae in global N cycles will
   require reevaluation of high-latitude perspectives on fractionation
   sources that structure ecosystem N-15 patterns, as well as better
   integration of EcM function with biogeochemical theories pertaining to
   climate-nutrient cycling relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean forest ecosystems are characterized by various vascular
   plant groups with their associated mycorrhizae and free living soil
   fungi with various ecological functions. Fire plays a major role in
   Mediterranean ecosystem dynamics and impacts both above- and
   below-ground community structure and functioning. However, studies on
   the effects induced by altered disturbance regimes (associated with
   recent land use and climate extremes) on fire ecology and especially on
   its below-ground impacts are few. The objectives of this study were to
   evaluate the effects of different wildfire regimes on soil fungal
   community structure using two different molecular methods. We
   investigated the long-term effects of wildfire on soil fungal
   communities associated with Pinus pinaster forests in central Portugal,
   by comparing the results of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
   (DGGE)-based profiling with those obtained with 454 pyrosequencing. Four
   forest stands with differing fire history and fire return interval, and
   vegetation cover (mature forest, early successional stage of pine
   regeneration, and forest converted to scrubland) were sampled 6 years
   after the last fire event. The pyrosequencing-based approach indicated
   ca. eight-fold higher numbers of taxa than DGGE. However, fungal
   community fingerprinting data obtained for the different study stands
   with DGGE were congruent with those obtained with pyrosequencing. Both
   short (7.6 years) and long (24 years) fire return intervals (indicated
   by the presence of ericaceous shrubs in the understorey) induced a
   decrease in the abundance ratio between basidiomycetes and ascomycetes
   and appeared to reduce the frequency of ectomycorrhizal fungal species
   and saprophytes. Wildfire significantly reduced the frequency of late
   stage successional taxa (e.g. Atheliaceae and Cantharellales) and known
   or putative saprophytes belonging to the Clavulinaceae and the
   Archaeorhizomycetaceae. Conversely, early successional fungal species
   belonging to the Thelephoraceae were favoured by both fire return
   intervals, while the abundance of Cortinarius and Hebeloma, which
   include several Cistus-specific species, increased with short wildfire
   return intervals. This last finding highlights the relationship between
   post-fire vegetation composition and cover (vegetation successional
   stage), and fungal symbionts. We hypothesise that these changes could,
   in the long term, exhaust the resilience of Mediterranean pine forest
   vegetation and associated soil fungal communities by preventing pine
   regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Plant biomass degradation in soil is one of the key steps of carbon
   cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Fungal saprotrophic communities play
   an essential role in this process by producing hydrolytic enzymes active
   on the main components of plant organic matter. Open questions in this
   field regard the diversity of the species involved, the major
   biochemical pathways implicated and how these are affected by external
   factors such as litter quality or climate changes. This can be tackled
   by environmental genomic approaches involving the systematic sequencing
   of key enzyme-coding gene families using soil-extracted RNA as material.
   Such an approach necessitates the design and evaluation of gene
   family-specific PCR primers producing sequence fragments compatible with
   high-throughput sequencing approaches. In the present study, we
   developed and evaluated PCR primers for the specific amplification of
   fungal CAZy Glycoside Hydrolase gene families GH5 (subfamily 5) and GH11
   encoding endo-beta-1,4-glucanases and endo beta-1,4-xylanases
   respectively as well as Basidiomycota class II peroxidases,
   corresponding to the CAZy Auxiliary Activity family 2 (AA2), active on
   lignin. These primers were experimentally validated using DNA extracted
   from a wide range of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota species including 27
   with sequenced genomes. Along with the published primers for Glycoside
   Hydrolase GH7 encoding enzymes active on cellulose, the newly design
   primers were shown to be compatible with the Illumina MiSeq sequencing
   technology. Sequences obtained from RNA extracted from beech or spruce
   forest soils showed a high diversity and were uniformly distributed in
   gene trees featuring the global diversity of these gene families. This

Abstract = {{Mycorrhizas are the chief organ for plant mineral nutrient acquisition.
   In temperate, mixed forests, ash roots (Fraxinus excelsior) are
   colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) and beech roots (Fagus
   sylvatica) by ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcM). Knowledge on the functions of
   different mycorrhizal species that coexist in the same environment is
   scarce. The concentrations of nutrient elements in plant and fungal
   cells can inform on nutrient accessibility and interspecific differences
   of mycorrhizal life forms. Here, we hypothesized that mycorrhizal fungal
   species exhibit interspecific differences in mineral nutrient
   concentrations and that the differences correlate with the mineral
   nutrient concentrations of their associated root cells. Abundant
   mycorrhizal fungal species of mature beech and ash trees in a long-term
   undisturbed forest ecosystem were the EcM Lactarius subdulcis, Clavulina
   cristata and Cenococcum geophilum and the AM Glomus sp. Mineral nutrient
   subcellular localization and quantities of the mycorrhizas were analysed
   after non-aqueous sample preparation by electron dispersive X-ray
   transmission electron microscopy. Cenococcum geophilum contained the
   highest sulphur, Clavulina cristata the highest calcium levels, and
   Glomus, in which cations and P were generally high, exhibited the
   highest potassium levels. Lactarius subdulcis-associated root cells
   contained the highest phosphorus levels. The root cell concentrations of
   K, Mg and P were unrelated to those of the associated fungal structures,
   whereas S and Ca showed significant correlations between fungal and
   plant concentrations of those elements. Our results support profound
   interspecific differences for mineral nutrient acquisition among
   mycorrhizas formed by different fungal taxa. The lack of correlation
   between some plant and fungal nutrient element concentrations may
   reflect different retention of mineral nutrients in the fungal part of
   the symbiosis. High mineral concentrations, especially of potassium, in
   Glomus sp. suggest that the well-known influence of tree species on
   chemical soil properties may be related to their mycorrhizal associates.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the environmental variables associated with fructification,

   All the terrestrial species developed under high canopy cover (above

   vitellinus were more frequently observed in open places, whereas
   Fistulina. antarctica, F. endoxantha and Grifola gargal seem to prefer
   high canopy cover. Fruiting of F. antarctica was associated with low

   C. dusenii. F. antarctica, Ramaria patagonica, C. magellanicus and A.
   vitellinus were found to have longer fruiting periods, from mid-March to

Abstract = {{Soils sequester and release substantial atmospheric carbon, but the
   contribution of fungal communities to soil carbon balance under rising
   CO2 is not well understood. Soil properties likely mediate these fungal
   responses but are rarely explored in CO2 experiments. We studied soil
   fungal communities in a grassland ecosystem exposed to a
   preindustrial-to-future CO2 gradient ( 250 to 500 ppm) in a black clay
   soil and a sandy loam soil. Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing of the
   rRNA gene cluster revealed that fungal community composition and its
   response to CO2 differed significantly between soils. Fungal species
   richness and relative abundance of Chytridiomycota ( chytrids) increased
   linearly with CO2 in the black clay ( P < 0.04, R-2 > 0.7), whereas the
   relative abundance of Glomeromycota ( arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi)
   increased linearly with elevated CO2 in the sandy loam ( P = 0.02, R-2 =
   0.63). Across both soils, decomposition rate was positively correlated
   with chytrid relative abundance ( r = 0.57) and, in the black clay soil,
   fungal species richness. Decomposition rate was more strongly correlated
   with microbial biomass ( r = 0.88) than with fungal variables. Increased
   labile carbon availability with elevated CO2 may explain the greater
   fungal species richness and Chytridiomycota abundance in the black clay
   soil, whereas increased phosphorus limitation may explain the increase
   in Glomeromycota at elevated O-2 in the sandy loam. Our results
   demonstrate that soil type plays a key role in soil fungal responses to
   rising atmospheric CO2.}},

Abstract = {{The ectomycorrhizal fungus Cenococcum geophilum (Ascomycota,
   Dothideomycetes) forms black, round to irregular sclerotia in forest
   soils. Fungi that colonize the sclerotia appear to affect sclerotia
   viability and may play an important role in the life history of
   Cenococcum. Some of the fungi could also affect nutrient cycling by
   decomposing Cenococcum sclerotia, which are melanized and recalcitrant
   to decay. We used a culture-based method to document the fungal
   communities growing inside surface-sterilized sclerotia that were
   collected from forest soils. Cenococcum was successfully isolated from
   297 of 971 sclerotia whereas 427 sclerotia hosted fungi other than
   Cenococcum. DNA barcoding of the internal transcribed spacer rDNA
   followed by grouping at 97\% sequence similarity yielded 85 operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs) that consisted primarily of Ascomycota (e.g.
   Chaetothyriales, Eurotiales, Helotiales, Pleosporales) and a few
   Basidiomycota and Mucoromycotina. Although most fungal OTUs were
   infrequently cultured, several OTUs such as members of Asterostroma,
   Cladophialophora, Oidiodendron, and Pleosporales were common and found

   variation in their natural carbon sources, basidiomycetes have highly
   varied plant-polysaccharide-degrading capabilities. This topic is not as
   well studied for basidiomycetes as for ascomycete fungi, which are the
   main sources of knowledge on fungal plant polysaccharide degradation.
   Research on plant-biomass-decaying fungi has focused on isolating
   enzymes for current and future applications, such as for the production
   of fuels, the food industry, and waste treatment. More recently, genomic
   studies of basidiomycete fungi have provided a profound view of the
   plant-biomass-degrading potential of wood-rotting, litter-decomposing,
   plant-pathogenic, and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) basidiomycetes. This review
   summarizes the current knowledge on plant polysaccharide
   depolymerization by basidiomycete species from diverse habitats. In
   addition, these data are compared to those for the most broadly studied
   ascomycete genus, Aspergillus, to provide insight into specific features
   of basidiomycetes with respect to plant polysaccharide degradation.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Crop production in subsistence agriculture in tropical Africa is still
   sustained mainly by short-to medium-term fallows to recuperate natural
   fertility of the soils. Microbes play a pivotal role both in the process
   of soil fertility restoration and in nutrient acquisition by the crops.
   Here we ask the question how the duration of fallow affects the
   composition of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF)
   communities and their contribution to maize nutrition and growth, in
   acidic, low P soils of southern Cameroon. This question has been
   addressed in a bioassay where soils collected from continuously cropped
   fields, short-term fallows dominated by Chromolaena odorata and
   long-term fallows (secondary forests) have been sterilized and back- and
   cross inoculated with living soils from the different land-use systems.
   Particular microbes larger than the pore size of the filter paper
   (mainly the fungi including the AMF) contained in the cropped and
   short-fallowed soils caused greater growth and P uptake stimulations to
   the maize as compared to the forest soil. By using molecular profiling,
   we demonstrated a shift in the composition of AMF communities along a
   gradient of fallow duration, changing from dominance by Rhizophagus in
   the forest fallow soil, to dominance by Claroideoglomus under cropland.
   Our results contradict the hypothesis that deterioration of quality of
   root symbiotic communities would be responsible for a rapid yield
   decline following deforestation, and indicate a positive feedback of
   cropping on mycorrhizal functioning under conditions of shifting
   agriculture in tropical Africa. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{213-221}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{(1) While it is well-known that trees release carbon (C) to soils as
   root exudates, the factors that control the magnitude and biogeochemical
   impacts of this flux are poorly understood.
   (2) We quantified root exudation and microbially-mediated nutrient
   fluxes in the rhizosphere for four similar to 80 year-old tree species
   in a deciduous hardwood forest, Indiana, USA. We hypothesized that trees
   that exuded the most carbon (C) would induce the strongest rhizosphere
   effects (i.e., the relative difference in nutrient fluxes between
   rhizosphere and bulk soil). Further, we hypothesized that tree species
   that associate with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi would exude more C than
   tree species that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi,
   resulting in a greater enhancement of nutrient cycling in ECM
   rhizospheres.
   (3) Mass-specific exudation rates and rhizosphere effects on C, N and P
   cycling were nearly two-fold greater for the two ECM tree species
   compared to the two AM tree species (P < 0.05). Moreover, across all
   species, exudation rates were positively correlated with multiple
   indices of nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition in the
   rhizosphere (P < 0.05). Annually, we estimate that root exudation
   represents 2.5\% of NPP in this forest, and that the exudate-induced
   changes in microbial N cycling may contribute similar to 18\% of total
   net N mineralization.
   (4) Collectively, our results indicate that the effects of roots on
   nutrient cycling are consequential, particularly in forests where the C
   cost of mining nutrients from decomposing soil organic matter may be
   greatest (e.g., ECM-dominated stands). Further, our results suggest that
   small C fluxes from exudation may have disproportionate impacts on
   ecosystem N cycling in nutrient-limited forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{204-212}},

Abstract = {{Host-plants may rarely leave their ancestral niche and in which case
   they tend to be surrounded by phylogenetically distant neighbours.
   Phylogenetically isolated host-plants might share few mutualists with
   their neighbours and might suffer from a decrease in mutualist support.
   In addition host plants leaving their ancestral niche might face a
   deterioration of their abiotic and biotic environment and might hence
   need to invest more into mutualist partners. We tested whether
   phylogenetic isolation of hosts from neighbours decreases or increases
   abundance and activity of their mutualists and whether mutualist
   activity may help to compensate deterioration of the environment. We
   study oak-hosts and their ectomycorrhizal fungi mutualists established
   in the litter layer formed by the phylogenetically closely or distantly
   related neighbourhood. We find that oaks surrounded by phylogenetically
   distant neighbours show increased abundance and enzymatic activity of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi in the litter. Moreover, oaks surrounded by
   phylogenetically distant neighbours also show delayed budburst but
   ectomycorrhizal fungi activity partly compensates this negative effect
   of phylogenetic isolation. This suggests decreased nutrient availability
   in a phylogenetically distant litter partly compensated by increased
   litter-degradation by ectomycorrhizal fungi activity. Most observed
   effects of phylogenetic isolation cannot be explained by a change in
   baseline soil fertility (as reflected by nutritional status of fresh oak
   litter, or soil microbial biomass and activity) nor by simple reduction
   of percentages of oak neighbours, nor by the presence of gymnosperms.
   Our results show that colonizing new niche represented by the presence
   of distantly related neighbours may delay plant phenology but may be
   supported by mycorrhizal mutualists. Studies on other host-plant species
   are required to generalize our findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{BOTANICAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{Background: Gastrodia flabilabella is a mycoheterotrophic orchid that
   obtains carbohydrates and nutrients from its symbiotic mycorrhizal
   fungi. The species is an endemic and vulnerable species enlisted in the
   ``A Preliminary Red List of Taiwanese Vascular Plants{''} according to
   the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria Version 3.1. G. flabilabella
   dwells the underground of broadleaf and coniferous forest with richness
   litter. Based on herbarium records, this species is distributed in
   central Taiwan. Twenty eight microsatellite loci were developed in G.
   flabilabella and were tested for cross-species amplification in
   additional taxa of G. confusoides, G. elata, and G. javanica. We
   estimated the genetic variation that is valuable for conservation
   management and the development of the molecular identification system
   for G. elata, a traditional Chinese medicine herb.
   Results: Microsatellite primer sets were developed from G. flabilabella
   using the modified AFLP and magnetic bead enrichment method. In total,
   257 microsatellite loci were obtained from a magnetic bead enrichment
   SSR library. Of the 28 microsatellite loci, 16 were polymorphic, in
   which the number of alleles ranged from 2 to 15, with the observed
   heterozygosity ranging from 0.02 to 1.00. In total, 15, 13, and 7 of the
   loci were found to be interspecifically amplifiable to G. confusoides,
   G. elata, and G. javanica, respectively.
   Conclusions: Amplifiable and transferable microsatellite loci are
   potentially useful for future studies in investigating intraspecific
   genetic variation, reconstructing phylogeographic patterns among closely
   related species, and establishing the standard operating system of
   molecular identification in Gastrodia.}},

Abstract = {{In the highlands of Western Kenya, intensified land use combined with
   low use of mineral fertilizers at farm level is driving soil nutrient
   depletion and declining yield levels. All farms and individual field
   crop plots are surrounded by life fences and the area under such hedge
   structure is estimated to cover 3-5\% of the total farmland area. The
   land below the hedges is not tilled and may receive nutrient and carbon
   inputs by the occasional addition of field crop residues and litter
   fall. We hypothesized that the areas covered by live fences represent
   not only an important land resource, but are also largely untapped sites
   characterized by high soil fertility in an otherwise largely degraded
   environment. We characterized physico-chemical attributes of top soils
   collected on farmland and from adjacent live fences composed of five
   different fencing species in representative environments of Kakamega
   district (sandy Acrisol and bimodal rainfall distribution vs. clay
   Ferralsol and monomodal rainfall distribution). In addition, the maize
   production potential of these soils was assessed in a supplementary pot
   experiment. Concentrations and total amounts of soil C, N, N supplying
   capacity, exchangeable K, as well as aggregate stability tended to be
   higher in hedge structures than in field crop soil. The amount of labile
   (permanganate- oxidizable) carbon and the carbon management index in
   fence lines on Acrisol were similar to those of the adjacent Kakamega
   rain forest reserve, while they were reduced by >50\% in crop fields.
   These trends were reflected in the biomass and Nand K uptake by maize in
   potted soil. Effects were generally larger in Acrisol than in Ferralsol
   and were most pronounced with Tithonia diversifolia. We conclude that
   live fences are soil fertility hotspots that may be valorised in the
   future by replacing the generally unproductive fencing species with
   economical perennial crops.}},

Abstract = {{The scientific basis for restoration of fire-excluded western

   fire-frequent forests. We compared the effects of wildfire and
   restoration (combined thinning and prescribed fire) in fire-excluded
   western larch forests. In 2012, the wildfire site had more, taller, and
   more diverse tree regeneration; greater volume of coarse woody debris
   (CWD); and greater spatial heterogeneity (including more area in large
   openings) than the restoration site. Management recommendations based on
   our results include the following: use more intense prescribed fire than
   was applied to the restoration site we studied; retain abundant CWD
   on-site after restoration treatment; and create occasional large
   openings to regenerate larch and emulate the spatial heterogeneity
   induced by natural wildfire. Our most important finding is the greater
   dynamism of the wildfire-affected site than of the restored site. At the
   wildfire site, tree populations are turning over faster, regenerating
   trees are growing faster, and more CWD is available for decomposition.
   These contrasting outcomes suggest that a conceptualization of forest
   restoration that emphasizes static, or at least equilibrium, conditions
   is not appropriate for western larch/mixed-conifer forests.}},

Abstract = {{Trophic interactions between heterotrophic soil microbes and grazing
   soil invertebrates influence decomposer community composition and
   function. Cord-forming basidiomycete fungi are primary agents of woody
   litter decomposition in temperate forests. In laboratory experiments,
   grazing by woodlice (Isopoda) is an important factor limiting the
   biomass and functioning (decomposition and extracellular enzyme
   production) of cord-forming fungi, but its significance in the field has
   hitherto not been studied. Field populations of the woodlouse, Oniscus
   asellus, were manipulated ('reduced' {[}zero] or standardised at
   `current' {[}28 m(-2)] or `double' {[}56 m(-2)] density) in delimited
   plots inoculated with different fungi (un-inoculated, Hypholoma
   fasciculare or Phanerochaete velutina) and the effects on the microbial
   decomposer community assessed after 6 and 12 months. Oniscus asellus
   population density was reduced after 12 months in comparison to the
   standardised numbers at start. Significant differences between
   population densities remained, but varied between fungal inoculation
   treatments. Fatty acid analysis revealed O. asellus as a true
   generalist; markers for plants, fungi and bacteria were consistently
   abundant in storage lipids. Seasonal effects on microbial biomass and
   function were strong. Although woodlouse population density neither
   affected fungal biomass nor microbial community composition (ergosterol
   and soil phospholipid fatty acids), it influenced enzyme activities,
   depending on the inoculated fungus. Woodlice significantly reduced
   leucine aminopeptidase and lignin-degrading peroxidase activities, only
   in un-inoculated plots. In contrast, the highest woodlouse population
   density increased beech (Fagus sylvatica) wood decomposition and leucine
   aminopeptidase activity in P. velutina-inoculated plots. Increased
   enzyme activity and decomposition is likely a stress response,
   reflecting increased production of specific enzymes to provide the
   energy for mycelial repair and growth responses to grazing. Effects of
   grazing on fungal biomass and activity will be strongest at microsites
   of woodlouse aggregation and where forest floor woodlouse population

Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{150-157}},

Abstract = {{Forest biogeochemical cycling is strongly influenced by the turnover of
   ectomycorrhizal fungal tissues. Fungal tissues may decompose differently
   from plant tissues due to their unique chemistry and may be important to
   understanding ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycles. Melanin is a
   recalcitrant, complex cell wall polymer commonly found in fungi. Melanin
   concentration varies significantly among species, which may contribute
   to the wide variation in their rates of decomposition previously
   observed. In a comparative experiment we examined decomposition of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi of varying melanin concentrations. In an
   additional experiment we examined the effect of melanin biosynthesis
   inhibition on decomposition of the highly melanized ectomycorrhizal
   fungus Cenococcum geophilum. Among species, initial melanin
   concentration was negatively correlated with decomposition while initial
   nitrogen concentration was positively correlated with decomposition.
   When melanin synthesis was inhibited, tissues of C. geophilum decomposed
   significantly faster. We conclude that melanin and nitrogen
   concentrations may control decomposition of ectomycorrhizal fungi as do
   lignin and nitrogen concentrations in plant material, and thus may have
   significant consequences for terrestrial carbon and nutrient cycling.

Abstract = {{Knowledge about the distribution pattern and function of soil microbial
   communities is essential for understanding their vital role in ecosystem
   functioning. However, little is known about the elevational patterns of
   microbial communities at high altitudes on the Tibetan Plateau, a region
   that is very sensitive to global change. We investigated the microbial
   community composition and functional patterns along an elevational
   gradient (3100-4600 m above sea level) on Mount Segrila using
   phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and community level physiological
   profiles (CLPP). Soil microbes were abundant even at higher altitudes
   and ranged from 1.52 to 3.53 mu mol per g organic carbon (OC) by total
   PLFAs. Soil microbial biomass (expressed as Total PLFAs) declined at
   higher elevations, and the highest abundance was observed at the
   low-elevation site. Fungal to bacterial ratio decreased with increasing
   elevation. While no consistent elevational pattern was observed for PLFA
   profiles, richness and diversity of carbon source utilization by the
   microbial community decreased significantly at higher altitudes. Soil
   microbes at higher altitudes had the potential to metabolize relatively
   more recalcitrant carbon components while microbes at lower altitudes
   tended to utilize labile carbon sources. The results were in line with
   the chemical composition of soil organic matter. Increasing O-alkyl C
   and decreasing alkyl C content indicate slow decomposition at higher
   elevations. Variations in structure and activity of microbial community
   were mainly attributable to MAT, pH, and litter C:N. Our results
   indicate that pH is a major factor affecting microbial communities, and
   the impact of soil pH is closely correlated with temperature and
   vegetation changes along the elevational gradient. As future climate
   warming may lead to temperature increases and an upward migration of
   vegetation, our results provide fundamental knowledge of soil microbial
   communities in the Tibetan alpine region and may help to predict
   responses of the below-ground community to global climate change. (C)

Abstract = {{Partially decomposed plant and animal remains have been accumulating in
   organic soils (i.e. >40\% C content) for millennia, making them the
   largest terrestrial carbon store. There is growing concern that, in a
   warming world, soil biotic processing will accelerate and release
   greenhouse gases that further exacerbate climate change. However, the
   magnitude of this response remains uncertain as the constraints are
   abiotic, biotic and interactive. Here, we examined the influence of
   resource quality and biological activity on the temperature sensitivity
   of soil respiration under different soil moisture regimes. Organic soils
   were sampled from 13 boreal and peatland ecosystems located in the
   United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Finland and Sweden, representing a
   natural resource quality range of C, N and P. They were incubated at
   four temperatures (4, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C) at either 60\% or 100\%
   water holding capacity (WHC). Our results showed that chemical and
   biological properties play an important role in determining soil
   respiration responses to temperature and moisture changes. High soil C :
   P and C : N ratios were symptomatic of slow C turnover and long-term C
   accumulation. In boreal soils, low bacterial to fungal ratios were
   related to greater temperature sensitivity of respiration, which was
   amplified in drier conditions. This contrasted with peatland soils which
   were dominated by bacterial communities and enchytraeid grazing,
   resulting in a more rapid C turnover under warmer and wetter conditions.
   The unexpected acceleration of C mineralization under high moisture
   contents was possibly linked to the primarily role of fermented organic
   matter, instead of oxygen, in mediating microbial decomposition. We
   conclude that to improve C model simulations of soil respiration, a
   better resolution of the interactions occurring between climate,
   resource quality and the decomposer community will be required.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the influence of plant functional groups on soil microbial
   community composition and nutrient cycling in a tropical Eucalyptus
   forest ecosystem with different plantation age and soil types by means
   of stem girdling (SG) and understory removal (UR). Fungal and bacterial

   ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) colonisation was estimated visually. Total
   bacterial and saprotrophic fungal biomass was highest in soils treated

   components, due to their modification of plant belowground C allocation

Abstract = {{Soil food webs play an important role in forest ecosystem functions that
   may be sensitive to global environmental change. We traced a pulse of
   C-13 from the root systems of young sugar maple stands through the soil
   food web to explore energy flow from roots to soil heterotrophs.
   Invasive earthworms (Lumbricidae) were the most highly-enriched taxa
   sampled, indicating that they were consuming significant quantities of
   live fine roots and mycorrhizae and assimilating significant amounts of
   root-derived C. Another invasive invertebrate, a weevil (Barypeithes
   pellucidus) also appeared to consume significant amounts of roots or
   root-derived C. High isotope enrichment in ants (Formicidae) may reflect
   their feeding on phloem-sucking coccids in soil. All the predators
   collected from the litter layer also exhibited high isotope enrichment,
   including the salamander Plethodon cinereus. Moreover, in the absence of
   invasive earthworms all the taxa of animals collected from surface soil
   were similarly highly-enriched in root-derived isotopes. The apparent
   importance of the root channel in supplying energy to the soil food web
   suggests that forest ecosystem functions could be highly sensitive to

Abstract = {{Accurate projections of the future land carbon (C) sink by terrestrial
   biosphere models depend on how nutrient constraints on net primary
   production are represented. While nutrient limitation is nearly
   universal, current models do not have a C cost for plant nutrient
   acquisition. Also missing are symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi, which can
   consume up to 20\% of net primary production and supply up to 50\% of a
   plant's nitrogen (N) uptake. Here we integrate simultaneous uptake and
   mycorrhizae into a cutting-edge plant N modelFixation and Uptake of
   Nitrogen (FUN)that can be coupled into terrestrial biosphere models. The
   C cost of N acquisition varies as a function of mycorrhizal type, with
   plants that support arbuscular mycorrhizae benefiting when N is
   relatively abundant and plants that support ectomycorrhizae benefiting
   when N is strongly limiting. Across six temperate forested sites
   (representing arbuscular mycorrhizal- and ectomycorrhizal-dominated
   stands and 176 site years), including multipath resistance improved the
   partitioning of N uptake between aboveground and belowground sources.
   Integrating mycorrhizae led to further improvements in predictions of N
   uptake from soil (R-2=0.69 increased to R-2=0.96) and from senescing
   leaves (R-2=0.29 increased to R-2=0.73) relative to the original model.
   On average, 5\% and 9\% of net primary production in arbuscular
   mycorrhizal- and ectomycorrhizal-dominated forests, respectively, was
   needed to support mycorrhizal-mediated acquisition of N. To the extent
   that resource constraints to net primary production are governed by
   similar trade-offs across all terrestrial ecosystems, integrating these
   improvements to FUN into terrestrial biosphere models should enhance
   predictions of the future land C sink.}},

Abstract = {{Sudden aspen decline (SAD), present in many parts of North America, is
   the sudden dieback of branches, crown loss, and rapid mortality of aspen
   (Populus tremuloides Michx.). We surveyed 21 plots in southwestern
   Colorado and categorized each plot by the mean percentage of recent
   crown loss (RCL) into three SAD levels: low SAD (0\%-25\% RCL), moderate
   SAD (25.1\%-50\% RCL), and high SAD (50.1\%-100\% RCL). Our research
   quantified the effects of SAD on microclimate and understory vegetation
   at the individual species and community level. Mean day surface, day
   subsurface, and night subsurface temperatures were warmer in high SAD
   stands than in low ones. High SAD stands had lower soil moisture, lower
   litter and duff depth, higher bare soil cover, higher photosynthetically
   active radiation, higher arbuscular mycorrhizal propagule densities, and
   higher grass biomass. Indicator plant species were uniquely associated
   with low and high SAD. Our study illustrates that SAD has multiple
   ecological effects on aspen understories, including a potential positive
   feedback in which warmer temperatures and decreased soil moisture,
   consequences of SAD, may lead to increased branch dieback and tree

Abstract = {{Precipitation as a key determinant of forest productivity influences

   precipitation for the soil and biomass nutrient pools and dynamics in 14
   mature European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests on Triassic
   sandstone. We tested the hypotheses that lowered summer precipitation
   (1) is associated with less acid soils and (2) a reduced accumulation of
   organic matter on the forest floor, and (3) reduces nutrient supply from
   the soil and leads to decreasing foliar and root nutrient
   concentrations. Soil acidity, the amount of forest floor organic matter,
   and the associated organic matter N and P pools decreased to about a
   half from wet to dry sites; the C/P and N/P ratios, but not the C/N
   ratio, of forest floor organic matter were reduced as well. Net N
   mineralization and P and K pools in the mineral soil did not change with
   decreasing precipitation. Foliar P and K concentrations (beech sun
   leaves) increased while N remained constant, resulting in decreasing
   foliar N/P and N/K ratios. Estimated N resorption efficiency increased
   toward the dry sites. We conclude that a reduction in summer rainfall
   significantly reduces the soil C, N and P pools but does not result in
   decreasing foliar N and P contents in beech. However, the decreasing
   foliar N/P ratios towards the dry stands indicate that the importance of
   P limitation for tree growth declines with decreasing precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{Decades of studies on the role of decomposition in carbon (C) and
   nitrogen (N) cycling have focused on organic matter (OM) of plant
   origin. Despite potentially large inputs of belowground OM from fungal
   cell walls and invertebrate exoskeletons, studies of the decomposability
   of their major constituent, chitin, are scarce. To explore effects on
   soil C dynamics of chitin, in comparison with two plant-derived
   chemicals, cellulose and lignin, I conducted a field-based
   chemical-addition experiment. The design contained three chemical
   treatments plus a control, with four replicates in each of two species
   of tropical trees grown in plantations. The chemicals were added in
   reagent-grade form at a rate that doubled the natural detrital C inputs
   of 1000 g C m(-2) y(-1). Despite its purported recalcitrance, chitin was
   metabolized quickly, with soil respiration (R (soil)) increasing by 64\%
   above the control within days, coupled with a 32\% increase in soil
   extractable ammonium. Cellulose, which was expected to be labile, was
   not readily decomposed, whereas lignin was rapidly metabolized at least
   partially in one of the forest types. I examined effects of
   stoichiometry by adding to all treatments ammonium nitrate in a quantity
   that adjusted the C:N of cellulose (166) to that of chitin (10), using
   both field and in vitro experiments. For cellulose, CO2 release
   increased more than five- to eightfold after N addition in root-free
   soil incubated in vitro, but only 0-20\% in situ where roots were
   intact. By the end of the 2-year-long field experiment, fine-root
   biomass tended to be higher in the chitin treatment, where R (soil) was
   significantly higher. Together these findings suggest that soil N
   availability limited cellulose decomposition, even in this Neotropical
   forest with high soil N stocks, and also that trees successfully
   competed for N that became available as chitin decomposed. These results
   indicate that the major constituent of cell walls of soil fungi, chitin,
   can decompose rapidly and release substantial N that is available for
   plant and microbial growth. As a consequence, soil fungi can stimulate
   soil OM decomposition and N cycling, and thereby play a disproportionate
   role in ecosystem C and N dynamics.}},

   Ectomycorrhizal fungi, foliage, and surficial litter declined 12 parts

Abstract = {{Root traits vary enormously among plant species but we have little
   understanding of how this variation affects their functioning. Of
   central interest is how root traits are related to plant resource
   acquisition strategies from soil. We examined root traits of 33 woody
   species from northeastern US forests that form two of the most common
   types of mutualisms with fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) and
   ectomycorrhizas (EM). We examined root trait distribution with respect
   to plant phylogeny, quantifying the phylogenetic signal (K statistic) in
   fine root morphology and architecture, and used phylogenetically
   independent contrasts (PICs) to test whether taxa forming different
   mycorrhizal associations had different root traits. We found a pattern
   of species forming roots with thinner diameters as species diversified
   across time. Given moderate phylogenetic signals (K = 0.44-0.68), we
   used PICs to examine traits variation among taxa forming AM or EM,
   revealing that hosts of AM were associated with lower branching
   intensity (r(PIC) = -0.77) and thicker root diameter (rPIC = -0.41).
   Because EM evolved relatively more recently and intermittently across
   plant phylogenies, significant differences in root traits and
   colonization between plants forming AM and EM imply linkages between the
   evolution of these biotic interactions and root traits and suggest a
   history of selection pressures, with trade-offs for supporting different
   types of associations. Finally, across plant hosts of both EM and AM,
   species with thinner root diameters and longer specific root length
   (SRL) had less colonization (rPIC = 0.85, -0.87), suggesting constraints
   on colonization linked to the evolution of root morphology.}},

Abstract = {{To find out how N-saturated forests can return to an N-limited state, we

   . We studied a 40-year-old experiment in Pinus sylvestris forest, with
   control plots, N0, three N treatments, N1-N3, of which N3 was stopped
   after 20 years, allowing observation of recovery.
   In N3, the N concentration in foliage was still slightly elevated, but
   the N uptake capacity of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots in N3 was no longer
   lower than in N0. Per area the amount of a biomarker for fungi, here
   mainly attributed ECM, was higher in N3 and N0 than in N1 and N2.
   Retention of labeled (NH4)-N-15 (+) by the soil was greater in the
   control (99 \%) and N3 (86 \%), than in N1 (45 \%) and N2 (29 \%); we
   ascribe these differences to biotic retention because cation exchange
   capacity did not vary. Gross N mineralisation and retention of N
   correlated, negatively and positively, respectively, with abundance of
   ECM fungal biomarker.
   . The results suggest a key role for ECM fungi in regulating the N
   cycle. We propose, in accordance with plant C allocation theory, that

Abstract = {{Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is grown on over 8 million ha in Brazil and
   is used to produce ethanol and sugar. Some sugarcane fields are burned
   to facilitate harvesting, which can affect the soil microbial community.
   However, whether sugarcane pre-harvest burning affects the community of
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and symbioses development is not
   known. In this study, we investigated the early impacts of harvest
   management on AMF spore communities and root colonization in three
   sugarcane varieties, under two harvest management systems (no-burning
   and pre-harvest burning). Soil and root samples were collected in the
   field after the first harvest of sugarcane varieties SP813250, SP801842,
   and RB72454, and AMF species were identified based on spore morphology.
   Diversity indices were determined based on spore populations and root
   colonization determined as an indicator of symbioses development. Based
   on the diversity indices, spore number and species occurrence in soil,
   no significant differences were observed among the AMF communities,
   regardless of harvest management type, sugarcane variety or interactions
   between harvest management type and sugarcane variety. However,
   mycorrhiza development was stimulated in sugarcane under the no-burning
   management system. Our data suggest that the sugarcane harvest
   management system may cause early changes in arbuscular mycorrhiza
   development.}},

Abstract = {{The early post-fire development of mycobiota following a crown fire in

   and in the corresponding unburnt stands in the coastal sand dunes of the
   Curonian Spit in western Lithuania was investigated. Species numbers in
   unburnt Pinus mugo and Pinus sylvestris stands showed annual
   fluctuation, but in the burnt sites, the numbers of fungi increased
   yearly, especially in the crown fire plots. Both burnt stand types-P.
   mugo and P. sylvestris-showed strongly significant (two-way ANOSIM; R =
   1, p < 0.05) differences in species composition; the differences between
   unburnt sites were clearly expressed but less significant (R = 0.86, p <
   0.05). Fungal species composition of burnt P. mugo and P. sylvestris
   sites was qualitatively different from that of corresponding unburnt
   sites (two-way ANOSIM; R a parts per thousand yen 0.75, p < 0.05). The
   chronosequence of mycobiota in surface fire burns was less clearly
   defined than in crown fire sites, reflecting the greater patchiness of
   impacts of the surface fire. Although both fire types were detrimental
   or at least damaging to all functional groups of fungi (saprobic on soil
   and forest litter, wood-inhabiting, biotrophic, and mycorrhizal and
   lichenized fungi), their recovery and appearance (fructification)
   patterns varied between the groups and among the burn types. The end of
   the early post-fire fungal succession (cessation of sporocarp production
   of pyrophilous fungi) was recorded 3 years after the fire for both crown
   and surface fire types, which is earlier than reported by other authors.
   Rare or threatened fungal species that are dependent on fire regime were

Abstract = {{Temperature and nutrients are major limiting factors in subarctic
   tundra. Experimental manipulation of nutrient availability along
   elevational gradients (and thus temperature) can improve our
   understanding of ecological responses to climate change. However, no
   study to date has explored impacts of nutrient addition along a tundra
   elevational gradient, or across contrasting vegetation types along any
   elevational gradient. We set up a full factorial nitrogen (N) and
   phosphorus (P) fertilization experiment in each of two vegetation types
   (heath and meadow) at 500 m, 800 m, and 1000 m elevation in northern
   Swedish tundra. We predicted that plant and microbial communities in
   heath or at lower elevations would be more responsive to N addition
   while communities in meadow or at higher elevations would be more
   responsive to P addition, and that fertilizer effects would vary more
   with elevation for the heath than for the meadow. Although our results
   provided little support for these predictions, the relationship between
   nutrient limitation and elevation differed between vegetation types.
   Most plant and microbial properties were responsive to N and/or P
   fertilization, but responses often varied with elevation and/or
   vegetation type. For instance, vegetation density significantly
   increased with N + P fertilization relative to the other fertilizer
   treatments, and this increase was greatest at the lowest elevation for
   the heath but at the highest elevation for the meadow. Arbuscular
   mycorrhizae decreased with P fertilization at 500 m for the meadow, but
   with all fertilizer treatments in both vegetation types at 800 m. Fungal
   to bacterial ratios were enhanced by N + P fertilization for the two
   highest elevations in the meadow only. Additionally, microbial responses
   to fertilization were primarily direct rather than indirect via plant
   responses, pointing to a decoupled response of plant and microbial
   communities to nutrient addition and elevation. Because our study shows
   how two community types differ in their responses to fertilization and
   elevation, and because the temperature range across this gradient is
   similar to 3 degrees C, our study is informative about how nutrient
   limitation in tundra may be influenced by temperature shifts that are
   comparable to those expected under climate change during this century.}},

Abstract = {{In northern forests, belowground sequestration of nitrogen (N) in

   Oxidative extracellular enzymes produced by ectomycorrhizal fungi may
   aid plant N acquisition by providing access to N in macromolecular

   species produce Mn-dependent peroxidases, and that the activity of these
   enzymes declines at elevated concentrations of inorganic N.
   In a boreal pine forest and a sub-arctic birch forest, Cortinarius DNA
   was assessed by 454-sequencing of ITS amplicons and related to
   Mn-peroxidase activity in humus samples with- and without previous N
   amendment. Transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes was
   investigated in field samples. Phylogenetic analyses of Cortinarius
   peroxidase amplicons and genome sequences were performed.
   We found a significant co-localization of high peroxidase activity and
   DNA from Cortinarius species. Peroxidase activity was reduced by high
   ammonium concentrations. Amplification of mRNA sequences indicated
   transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes under field conditions.
   The Cortinarius glaucopus genome encodes 11 peroxidases - a number
   comparable to many white-rot wood decomposers.
   These results support the hypothesis that some ectomycorrhizal fungi -
   Cortinarius species in particular - may play an important role in
   decomposition of complex organic matter, linked to their mobilization of

Abstract = {{RATIONALE Stable isotope analysis (SIA) is used widely for
   reconstructing trophic links of vertebrate and invertebrate animals.
   Soil macrofauna form a substantial food source for a range of predators
   including amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. SIA-based estimations
   of their trophic niches require knowledge on the full range of isotopic
   signatures of potential preys. Considering the extremely high diversity
   of soil animals, this information is not easy to obtain. METHODS We
   estimated a typical range of the isotopic signatures of soil macrofauna
   by compiling published and original data on soil macroinvertebrates in
   11 temperate forests. We examined whether the baseline correction (i.e.
   subtracting 13C or 15N values of local litter) would decrease the
   between-site variability in the 13C and 15N values of soil animals. The
   dataset was subsequently used to estimate the frequency distribution of
   13C and 15N values in saprophagous and predatory soil animals. RESULTS
   The baseline correction reduced the between-site variability in 15N, but
   not in 13C values of soil animals. Over 95\% of the taxa or individuals
   examined fell into an isotopic space with uncorrected 13C values ranging
   from -27.9 to -22.5 parts per thousand, and litter-normalized 15N values
   from 0.8 to 9.6 parts per thousand. Saprophagous and predatory soil
   animals were on average enriched in 13C relative to plant litter by 3.5
   and 2.7 parts per thousand, respectively, which is likely to reflect the
   importance of saprotrophic microorganisms as the main energy source in
   soil food webs. The difference in 15N values between saprophages and
   predators averaged 2.8 parts per thousand, which fits the anticipated
   trophic enrichment per trophic level. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate
   that the range of possible 15N values of soil macrofauna in temperate
   forest ecosystems can roughly be predicted based on the 15N values of
   plant litter. On the other hand, no site-specific normalization is
   usually required when predicting the range of 13C values of soil
   macroinvertebrates. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial communities in soil mediate biogeochemical processes; however,

   and functional gene composition of saprotrophic fungi along a 4000-year
   glacial chronosequence. A direct relationship between -diversity and
   geographic distance, a proxy for time since deglaciation, indicated that
   dispersal limitation shapes saprotrophic fungal communities. Further, we
   infer that dispersal limitation may also influence fungal functional
   properties as metabolic potential and functional richness increased with
   site age. Despite attempts to minimize environmental variation, a direct
   relationship between -diversity and biogeochemical differences across
   sites indicated that environmental filtering further shapes fungal
   community composition. However, environmental filtering was overshadowed
   by the effect of dispersal limitation when tested by multiple
   regression. Fungal -diversity and composition of functional genes
   involved in plant litter decay were unrelated, suggesting that
   functional traits are not phylogenetically conserved across this

Abstract = {{Roots of forest trees are associated with various ectomycorrhizal (ECM)
   fungal species that are involved in nutrient exchange between host plant

   environmental samples is difficult. The present study tested the
   feasibility of attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared
   (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy followed by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)
   to discriminate in situ collected ECM fungal species. Root tips
   colonized by distinct ECM fungal species, i.e., Amanita rubescens,
   Cenococcum geophilum, Lactarius subdulcis, Russula ochroleuca, and
   Xerocomus pruinatus were collected in mono-specific beech (Fagus
   sylvatica) and mixed deciduous forests in different geographic areas to
   investigate the environmental variability of the ECM FTIR signatures. A
   clear HCA discrimination was obtained for ECM fungal species independent
   of individual provenance. Environmental variability neither limited the
   discrimination between fungal species nor provided sufficient resolution
   to discern species sub-clusters for different sites. However, the
   de-convoluted FTIR spectra contained site-related spectral information
   for fungi with wide nutrient ranges, but not for Lactarius subdulcis, a
   fungus residing only in the litter layer. Specific markers for distinct
   ECM were identified in spectral regions associated with carbohydrates
   (i.e., mannans), lipids, and secondary protein structures. The present
   results support that FTIR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate
   analysis is a reliable and fast method to identify ECM fungal species in
   minute environmental samples. Moreover, our data suggest that the FTIR
   spectral signatures contain information on physiological and functional
   traits of ECM fungi.}},

   fungal (AMF) infection intensity were assessed monthly over 1 y in the
   grassland, scrub, secondary and mature forests of the Atlantic Forest
   ecosystem, amounting to 13 consecutive samplings. Fine roots were
   sampled in three 100 x 100-m plots at each study site. Each plot was
   subdivided in five 20 x 100-m subplots and 15 soil samples were randomly
   taken from a depth of 0-5 cm in soil within each plot. The average of
   the fine-root dry mass increased from 1.39 mg cm(-3) soil in the
   grassland to 3.37 mg cm(-3) in the secondary forest; fine-root tip
   diameter varied from 146 mu m in the grassland to 303 mu m in the mature
   forest; tissue density from 0.24 g cm(-3) root in the grassland to 0.30
   g cm(-3) in the mature forest and fine-root length was 4.52 cm cm-3 soil

   67\% in the grassland and 30\% in the mature forest; the length of root
   hairs was 215 mu m in the grassland and 112 mu m in the mature forest;
   and the intensity of AMF infection decreased from 66\% in the grassland
   to 17\% in the mature forest. In addition to AMF infection, the
   environmental variation also affected dry mass production and
   morphological traits of fine roots. During the cool season, fine-root
   dry mass, fine-root length, incidence and length of root hairs and
   intensity of AMF infection decreased compared with the warm season. We
   verified that the potential for soil exploration, that expresses the
   capacity for nutrient acquisition via fine roots and AMF infection
   intensity, decreased during the cool season and with the advance of the

Abstract = {{We investigated the response of soil microbial communities in tropical
   ecosystems to increased nutrient deposition, such as predicted by
   anthropogenic change scenarios. Moderate amounts of nitrogen and
   phosphorus and their combination were added along an altitudinal
   transect. We expected microorganisms and microbial grazers (testate
   amoebae) to significantly respond to nutrient additions with the effect
   increasing with increasing altitude and with duration of nutrient
   additions. Further, we expected nutrients to alter grazer-prey
   interrelationships. Indeed, nutrient additions strongly altered
   microbial biomass (MB) and community structure as well as the community
   structure of testate amoebae. The response of microorganisms varied with
   both altitude and duration of nutrient addition. The results indicate
   that microorganisms are generally limited by N, but saprotrophic fungi
   also by P. Also, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi benefited from N and/or P
   addition. Parallel to MB, testate amoebae benefited from the addition of
   N but were detrimentally affected by P, with the addition of P negating
   the positive effect of N. Our data suggests that testate amoeba
   communities are predominantly structured by abiotic factors and by
   antagonistic interactions with other microorganisms, in particular
   mycorrhizal fungi, rather than by the availability of prey. Overall, the

Abstract = {{Understanding climate effects on plant-soil interactions in terrestrial
   ecosystems remains challenging due to the fact that floristic
   composition covaries with climate, particularly along rainfall
   gradients. It is difficult to separate effects of precipitation per se
   from those mediated indirectly through changes in species composition.
   As such, afforestation (the intentional planting of woody species) in
   terrestrial ecosystems provides an ecological opportunity to assess the
   relative importance of climate and vegetation controls on ecosystem
   processes.
   We investigated the impacts of 35years of afforestation on ecosystem N
   dynamics, in ecosystems ranging from arid shrub-steppe to closed-canopy
   forest in Patagonia, Argentina. Sites of natural vegetation and adjacent
   sites planted with a single exotic species, Pinus ponderosa, were
   identified in five precipitation regimes along a continuous gradient of
   250-2200mm mean annual precipitation (MAP). We evaluated C and N
   parameters of vegetation and soil, as well as natural abundance of C-13
   and N-15 in leaves, roots, ectomycorrhizae (EcM) and soils.
   In natural vegetation, most leaf traits (\%N, C:N ratios, leaf mass per
   area, delta N-15 values) demonstrated strong significant relationships
   with MAP, while these relationships were nearly absent in afforested
   sites. In addition, the EcM of native southern beech and pine trees were
   significantly enriched in N-15 relative to leaves at all sites where
   they were present. While soil C and N pools in both vegetation types
   increased with MAP, overall pool sizes were significantly reduced in
   afforested sites.
   Synthesis. Observed relationships between leaf traits and precipitation
   in natural vegetation may be driven largely by shifts in species
   composition and plant-soil interactions, rather than direct effects of
   precipitation. Our results suggest that a change in the species
   composition of the dominant vegetation is sufficient to alter C and N
   cycling independently of climate constraints: pine afforestation
   homogenized N dynamics across sites spanning an order of magnitude of
   MAP. These results highlight the important control of ectomycorrhizal
   associations in affecting C and N dynamics. Additionally, they serve to
   demonstrate that altering natural species composition alone is
   sufficient to cause large, detectable impacts on N turnover
   independently of direct climate effects.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive plant species can interact with native soil microbes in ways
   that change how they use nutrients and allocate biomass. To examine
   whether Microstegium vimineum form symbiotic associations with
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and whether AMF mediate nutrient
   acquisition and growth of the plant, we conducted a field survey in
   Raleigh, NC and Hangzhou, China and two experiments in growth chambers.
   This is the first report that M. vimineum is mycorrhizal, with
   colonization rates of 47 and 21 \% in its native and invaded range,
   respectively. In the growth chamber, addition of an AMF inoculum mixture
   significantly promoted M. vimineum biomass accumulation in both field
   and sterilized soils, particularly after 64 days of growth. Arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi also increased plant phosphorous (P) uptake but did
   not consistently affect total plant nitrogen (N) acquisition, leading to
   decreases in plant N:P ratios. More interestingly, AMF significantly
   altered plant morphology, increasing the number of stolons and aerial
   roots per individual (59 and 723 \%), aerial roots per gram aboveground
   biomass (374 \%) and aerial roots per stolon (404 \%). Our results
   suggest that mycorrhizal enhancement of plant growth by stimulating
   tillering may serve as another mechanism by which M. vimineum can
   quickly take over new territory. Future studies on invasive
   plant-microbial interactions are needed to understand the mechanisms
   through which microbes contribute to the competitive ability of invasive
   plants.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the ecological processes that structure communities and the
   consequences for ecosystem function is a central goal of ecology. The
   recognition that fungi, bacteria, and viruses control key ecosystem
   functions has made microbial communities a major focus of this field.
   Because many ecological processes are apparent only at particular
   spatial or temporal scales, a complete understanding of the linkages
   between microbial community, environment, and function requires analysis
   across a wide range of scales. Here, we map the biological and
   functional geography of soil fungi from local to continental scales and
   show that the principal ecological processes controlling community
   structure and function operate at different scales. Similar to plants or
   animals, most soil fungi are endemic to particular bioregions,
   suggesting that factors operating at large spatial scales, like
   dispersal limitation or climate, are the first-order determinants of
   fungal community structure in nature. By contrast, soil extracellular
   enzyme activity is highly convergent across bioregions and widely
   differing fungal communities. Instead, soil enzyme activity is
   correlated with local soil environment and distribution of fungal traits
   within the community. The lack of structure-function relationships for
   soil fungal communities at continental scales indicates a high degree of
   functional redundancy among fungal communities in global biogeochemical
   cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Cryoturbation, the burial of topsoil material into deeper soil horizons
   by repeated freeze-thaw events, is an important storage mechanism for
   soil organic matter (SOM) in permafrost-affected soils. Besides abiotic
   conditions, microbial community structure and the accessibility of SOM
   to the decomposer community are hypothesized to control SOM
   decomposition and thus have a crucial role in SOM accumulation in buried
   soils. We surveyed the microbial community structure in cryoturbated
   soils from nine soil profiles in the northeastern Siberian tundra using
   high-throughput sequencing and quantification of bacterial, archaeal and
   fungal marker genes. We found that bacterial abundances in buried
   topsoils were as high as in unburied topsoils. In contrast, fungal
   abundances decreased with depth and were significantly lower in buried
   than in unburied topsoils resulting in remarkably low fungal to
   bacterial ratios in buried topsoils. Fungal community profiling revealed
   an associated decrease in presumably ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. The
   abiotic conditions (low to subzero temperatures, anoxia) and the reduced
   abundance of fungi likely provide a niche for bacterial, facultative
   anaerobic decomposers of SOM such as members of the Actinobacteria,
   which were found in significantly higher relative abundances in buried
   than in unburied topsoils. Our study expands the knowledge on the
   microbial community structure in soils of Northern latitude permafrost
   regions, and attributes the delayed decomposition of SOM in buried soils
   to specific microbial taxa, and particularly to a decrease in abundance
   and activity of ECM fungi, and to the extent to which bacterial
   decomposers are able to act as their functional substitutes.}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of agriculture land to short rotation coppice (SRC)
   systems with hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) is becoming an important
   practice to store carbon and produce biomass for the fiber industry.
   This land-use change is likely to affect the microbial community
   structure, in part through the introduction of an ectomycorrhizal host,
   but also by changing organic matter inputs, ultimately shifting the
   molecular composition of soil organic matter (SOM) because these
   properties are crop-specific. The objective of this study was to examine
   the effect of different aged poplar stands growing on Orthic Gray
   Luvisols on these soil properties compared to an adjacent perennial
   crop. The site consisted of four treatments: hybrid poplar (Populus
   deltoides x Populus petroskyana) in SRC of 7 and 14 years age (Pop7 and
   Pop14), a 40-year-old aspen (Populus tremuloides) forest (Aspen), and an
   adjacent arable site with alfalfa (Medicago sativa). The molecular
   composition of SOM was determined using pyrolysis-field ionization mass
   spectrometry (Py-FIMS) and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge
   spectroscopy at the nitrogen (N) K-edge (N-XANES). Phospholipid fatty
   acid (PLFA) profiles revealed higher concentrations of fungal but not
   bacterial biomarkers in poplar plantations than under alfalfa.
   Fungal:bacterial ratio was lower under alfalfa than under poplar trees.
   Overall microbial community structure also changed in response to
   vegetation type and the duration of woody biomass. Along the
   chronosequence of poplar, Py-FIMS revealed significant increases in the
   proportions of carbohydrates with pentose and hexose subunits, phenols
   and lignin monomers, alkylaromatics and peptides and significant
   decreases in lipids, alkanes, alkenes, bound fatty acids and
   alkylmonoesters and free fatty acids with increasing poplar stand age.
   Thermal stability of sterols decreased along the chronosequence,
   suggesting that poplar plantations are not involved in the build-up of
   these substances. Differences in the ordination were well reflected by N
   K-edge XANES spectra. Increased carbohydrate portions indicated a
   significant impact of the ectomycorrhizal host poplar on the molecular
   composition of SOM in arable soils. Our results demonstrate that a
   change in land-use from agricultural cropping to woody biomass caused
   shifts in microbial community structure that were lagged by a shift in
   SOM chemistry. These shifts impact soil functioning and should be
   considered in future land management strategies when SRC are harvested.

Abstract = {{sNitrogen (N) accumulation into woody debris is well documented, but the
   forms of N translocated, the mechanism through which this occurs
   (purportedly via translocation by cord-forming fungi) and the temporal
   pattern of N accumulation are not well studied. In soil microcosms, we
   incubated wood blocks (Pseudotsuga menziesii) inoculated with the
   cord-forming decay fungus Hypholoma fasciculare, and applied four forms
   of isotopically-labeled N ((NH4+)-N-15 (NO3-)-N-15, N-15-glycine and
   N-15 labeled litter) at the mycelial growing fronts to evaluate
   translocation and accumulation of diverse N sources by wood-decay fungi.
   Identically treated un-inoculated wood blocks were incubated. Three
   sampling times (6, 18 and 30 days after N addition) were used to
   identify trends in 15N transfer and total N accumulation. Wood blocks
   inoculated with H. fasciculare assimilated significantly more 15N than
   un-inoculated blocks for all 15N treatments on at least one sampling
   occasion. After a total of 73 days of incubation in microcosms,
   inoculated wood blocks increased in absolute N content by 211\% relative
   to control blocks, but 80\% of this accumulated N was lost by day 97.
   The small amount of 15N that was transferred into wood contrasted with
   the large increase in total N, suggesting that the site of N transfer
   was largely from soil under the wood blocks rather than at the site of
   15N injection. The precipitous decline in N content was attributed to
   visible indications of mycelial senescence, possibly due to carbon
   limitation. If these findings are extrapolated to a cut-block, it
   follows that woody debris on the forest floor colonized by wood decay
   fungi would accumulate N, at least in the early stages of decay, and
   this process may immobilize N after harvest. If retention of N on site
   after harvest is a management objective, site preparation that maximizes
   accumulation of N in woody debris by saprotrophic fungi should be
   employed. This would involve homogenously distributing woody debris on
   site in close contact with the forest floor in order to promote fungal
   colonization and N accumulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   knowledge gap is the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) and
   saprotrophic fungi contribute to C cycling in the systems by soil
   organic matter (SOM) decomposition. In this study, we used a novel
   approach to generate and compare enzymatically active EMF
   hyphae-dominated and saprotrophic hyphae-enriched communities under
   field conditions. Fermentation-humus (FH)-filled mesh bags, surrounded
   by a sand barrier, effectively trapped EMF hyphae with a community
   structure comparable to that found in the surrounding FH layer, at both
   trophic and taxonomic levels. In contrast, over half the sequences from
   mesh bags with no sand barrier were identified as belonging to
   saprotrophic fungi. The EMF hyphae-dominated systems exhibited levels of
   hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme activities that were comparable to or
   higher than saprotroph-enriched systems. The enzymes assayed included
   those associated with both labile and recalcitrant SOM degradation. Our
   study shows that EMF hyphae are likely important contributors to current
   SOM turnover in sub-boreal systems. Our results also suggest that any
   increased EMF biomass that might result from higher below-ground C
   allocation by trees would not suppress C fluxes from sub-boreal soils.}},

Abstract = {{Heterotrophic soil microbes regulate the rate-limiting step in soil
   organic matter decomposition via the production of hydrolytic and
   oxidative extracellular enzymes. The influence of climate change on
   heterotrophic microbial activity remains poorly understood, not least in
   terms of the differential sensitivity of microbial functional groups to
   warming and altered precipitation regimes. Cord-forming basidiomycete
   fungi dominate primary decomposition in temperate woodlands. We
   investigate the interactive influence of elevated temperature (3 degrees
   C), wetting and drying (6-9\% increase and 5-6\% decrease of soil
   moisture, respectively) on saprotrophic basidiomycete-mediated beech
   (Fagus sylvatica) wood decomposition, as well as on hydrolytic
   (beta-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, beta-xylosidase,
   N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, acid phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase)
   and oxidative (peroxidase and phenoloxidase) enzyme potential
   activities, in woodland soil mesocosms. While drying decreased beech
   wood decomposition rate, warming resulted in an increased rate and
   compensated for the negative effect of drying. Moisture regulated the
   extracellular enzyme pool; all enzymes except leucine aminopeptidase had
   significantly greater potential activity under wetting than drying.
   Again, elevated temperature consistently compensated for the negative
   effect of drying, but did not increase extracellular enzyme potential
   activity, alone or in combination with wetting. This reflects microbial
   production (fungal biomass was not increased under these conditions)
   rather than in situ effects on enzyme kinetics. N-acetyl-glucosaminidase
   and acid phosphatase displayed differential responses to temperature and
   moisture in systems dominated by different fungi. Decomposer communities
   appear to be more functionally resilient to the combined effects of
   elevated temperature and altered moisture than is suggested based on the
   manipulation of single abiotic variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{FEB 3}},
Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) deposition and its ecological effects on forest ecosystems
   have received global attention. Plantations play an important role in
   mitigating climate change through assimilating atmospheric CO2. However,
   the mechanisms by which increasing N additions affect net ecosystem
   production (NEP) of plantations remain poorly understood. A field
   experiment was initialized in May 2009, which incorporated additions of
   four rates of N (control (no N addition), low-N (5 g N m(-2) yr(-1)),
   medium-N (10 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), and high-N (15 g N m(-2) yr(-1))) at the
   Saihanba Forestry Center, Hebei Province, northern China, a locality
   that contains the largest area of plantations in China. Net primary
   production (NPP), soil respiration, and its autotrophic and
   heterotrophic components were measured. Plant tissue carbon (C) and N
   concentrations (including foliage, litter, and fine roots), microbial
   biomass, microbial community composition, extracellular enzyme
   activities, and soil pH were also measured. N addition significantly
   increased NPP, which was associated with increased litter N
   concentrations. Autotrophic respiration (AR) increased but heterotrophic
   respiration (HR) decreased in the high N compared with the medium N
   plots, although the HR in high and medium N plots did not significantly
   differ from that in the control. The increased AR may derive from
   mycorrhizal respiration and rhizospheric microbial respiration, not live
   root respiration, because fine root biomass and N concentrations showed
   no significant differences. Although the HR was significantly suppressed
   in the high-N plots, soil microbial biomass, composition, or activity of
   extracellular enzymes were not significantly changed. Reduced pH with
   fertilization also could not explain the pattern of HR. The reduction of
   HR may be related to altered microbial C use efficiency. NEP was
   significantly enhanced by N addition, from 149 to 426.6 g C m(-2)
   yr(-1). Short-term N addition may significantly enhance the role of
   plantations as an important C sink.}},

   their resources}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 3}},
Abstract = {{Terrestrial microbial decomposer communities thrive on a wide range of
   organic matter types that rarely ever meet their elemental demands. In
   this review we synthesize the current state-of-the-art of microbial
   adaptations to resource stoichiometry, in order to gain a deeper
   understanding of the interactions between heterotrophic microbial
   communities and their chemical environment. The stoichiometric imbalance
   between microbial communities and their organic substrates generally
   decreases from wood to leaf litter and further to topsoil and subsoil
   organic matter. Microbial communities can respond to these imbalances in
   four ways: first, they adapt their biomass composition toward their
   resource in a non-homeostatic behavior. Such changes are, however, only
   moderate, and occur mainly because of changes in microbial community
   structure and less so due to cellular storage of elements in excess.
   Second, microbial communities can mobilize resources that meet their
   elemental demand by producing specific extracellular enzymes, which, in
   turn, is restricted by the C and N requirement for enzyme production
   itself. Third, microbes can regulate their element use efficiencies
   (ratio of element invested in growth over total element uptake), such
   that they release elements in excess depending on their demand (e.g.,
   respiration and N mineralization). Fourth, diazotrophic bacteria and
   saprotrophic fungi may trigger the input of external N and P to
   decomposer communities. Theoretical considerations show that adjustments
   in element use efficiencies may be the most important mechanism by which
   microbes regulate their biomass stoichiometry. This review summarizes
   different views on how microbes cope with imbalanced supply of C, N and
   P thereby providing a framework for integrating and linking microbial
   adaptation to resource imbalances to ecosystem scale fluxes across
   scales and ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Northern peatlands are important carbon (C) sinks and while the patterns
   of C accumulation have been frequently investigated, nitrogen (N) and
   phosphorus (P) accumulation are often neglected. Here we link the C: N:
   P stoichiometry from foliar plant tissues, through senescent litters to
   peat, and determine C, N and P accumulation rates at Mer Bleue Bog,
   eastern Canada. Average C: N: P ratios changed from 794: 17: 1 in the
   foliar tissues to 911: 10: 1 in litter and 1285: 32: 1 in acrotelm peat.
   The increase in C: N and C: P ratios from mature to senescent tissues is
   related to nutrient resorption. The increase in C: P and N: P ratios in
   peat, which was contrary to that observed in Canadian forest soils, may
   be related to plant/mycorrhizae uptake of P. The long-term apparent
   rates of C, N and P accumulation were 29.5 +/- 2.1 (SE) g C, 0.87 +/-
   0.01 g N and 0.017 +/- 0.002 g P m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The
   significant correlation between the accumulation rates of N and P and

Abstract = {{Ecosystems change between arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal
   vegetation dominance over anthropological and geological time scales,
   yet consequences for ecosystem function are unclear. We review four
   hypotheses for the effect of mycorrhizal status on ecosystem function.
   Specifically, that differences between ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular
   mycorrhizal dominated ecosystems are driven by (1) foliar trait
   differences, (2) positive plant-soil feedback in ectomycorrhizal plants,
   (3) differences in the ability to dissolve rocks as a source of
   nutrition, and (4) differences in the ability to use organic nutrients.
   We find no universal difference in foliar traits with mycorrhizal
   status. A spatial simulation suggests that positive plant-soil feedback
   in ectomycorrhizal plants is unlikely to drive ecosystem differences.
   However, negative feedback appears to be more common in arbuscular
   mycorrhizal trees than ectomycorrhizal trees and may represent an
   important ecosystem difference. Rock dissolution occurs under both
   mycorrhizal types but may differ in rate. Hypothesis 4 was the best
   supported: a model and some field evidence suggest that decoupling of
   carbon and nutrients in ectomycorrhizal decomposition leads to
   inhibition of saprotrophic mineralization, with context-dependent
   effects. Greater understanding of organic nutrient utilization
   differences may be key to improving incorporation of mycorrhizas in
   ecosystem ecology.}},

Pages = {{975-985}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In High Arctic ecosystems, plant growth and reproduction are limited by
   low soil moisture and nutrient availability, low soil and air
   temperatures, and a short growing season. Mycorrhizal associations
   facilitate plant nutrient acquisition and water uptake and may therefore
   be particularly ecologically important in nutrition-poor and dry
   environments, such as parts of the Arctic. Similarly, endophytic root
   associates are thought to play a protective role, increasing plants'
   stress tolerance, and likely have an important ecosystem function.
   Despite the importance of these root-associated fungi, little is known
   about their host specificity in the Arctic. We investigated the host
   specificity of root-associated fungi in the common, widely distributed
   arctic plant species Bistorta vivipara, Salix polaris and Dryas
   octopetala in the High Arctic archipelago Svalbard. High-throughput
   sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplified from
   whole root systems generated no evidence of host specificity and no
   spatial autocorrelation within two 3mx3m sample plots. The lack of
   spatial structure at small spatial scales indicates that Common Mycelial
   Networks (CMNs) are rare in marginal arctic environments. Moreover, no
   significant differences in fungal OTU richness were observed across the
   three plant species, although their root system characteristics (size,
   biomass) differed considerably. Reasons for lack of host specificity
   could be that association with generalist fungi may allow arctic plants
   to more rapidly and easily colonize newly available habitats, and it may
   be favourable to establish symbiotic relationships with fungi possessing
   different physiological attributes.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the role of taxonomical and functional ectomycorrhizal (ECM)
   fungal diversity in root formation and nutrient uptake by Norway spruce
   (Picea abies) seedlings with fast- and slow-growing phenotypes.
   Seedlings were grown with an increasing ECM fungal diversity gradient
   from one to four species and sampled before aboveground growth
   differences between the two phenotypes were apparent. ECM fungal
   colonization patterns were determined and functional diversity was
   assayed via measurements of potential enzyme activities of eight
   exoenzymes probably involved in nutrient mobilization. Phenotypes did
   not vary in their receptiveness to different ECM fungal species.
   However, seedlings of slow-growing phenotypes had higher fine-root
   density and thus more condensed root systems than fast-growing
   seedlings, but the potential enzyme activities of ectomycorrhizas did
   not differ qualitatively or quantitatively. ECM species richness
   increased host nutrient acquisition potential by diversifying the
   exoenzyme palette. Needle nitrogen content correlated positively with
   high chitinase activity of ectomycorrhizas. Rather than fast- and
   slow-growing phenotypes exhibiting differing receptiveness to ECM fungi,
   our results suggest that distinctions in fine-root structuring and in
   the belowground growth strategy already apparent at early stages of
   seedling development may explain later growth differences between fast-
   and slow-growing families.}},

Abstract = {{Soil extracellular enzymes are the proximal drivers of decomposition.
   However, the relative influence of climate, soil nutrients and edaphic
   factors compared to microbial community composition on extracellular
   enzyme activities (EEA) is poorly resolved. Determining the relative
   effects of these factors on soil EEA is critical since changes in
   climate and microbial species composition may have large impacts on
   decomposition. We measured EEA from five sites during the growing season
   in March and 17 sites during the dry season in July throughout southern
   California and simultaneously collected data on climate, soil nutrients,
   soil edaphic factors and fungal community composition. The concentration
   of carbon and nitrogen in the soil and soil pH were most related to
   hydrolytic EEA. Conversely, oxidative EEA was mostly related to mean
   annual precipitation. Fungal community composition was not correlated
   with EEA at the species, genus, family or order levels. The hyphal
   length of fungi was correlated with EEA during the growing season while
   relative abundance of taxa within fungal phyla, in particular
   Chytridiomycota, was correlated with the EEA of beta-glucosidase,
   cellobiohydrolase, acid phosphatase and beta-xylosidase in the dry
   season. Overall, in the dry season, 35.3 \% of the variation in all
   enzyme activities was accounted for by abiotic variables, while fungal
   composition accounted for 27.4 \%. Because global change is expected to
   alter precipitation regimes and increase nitrogen deposition in soils,
   EEA may be affected, with consequences for decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{In old and heavily weathered soils, the availability of P might be so
   small that the primary production of plants is limited. However, plants
   have evolved several mechanisms to actively take up P from the soil or
   mine it to overcome this limitation. These mechanisms involve the active
   uptake of P mediated by mycorrhiza, biotic de-occlusion through root
   clusters, and the biotic enhancement of weathering through root
   exudation. The objective of this paper is to investigate how and where
   these processes contribute to alleviate P limitation on primary
   productivity. To do so, we propose a process-based model accounting for
   the major processes of the carbon, water, and P cycles including
   chemical weathering at the global scale. Implementing P limitation on
   biomass synthesis allows the assessment of the efficiencies of biomass
   production across different ecosystems. We use simulation experiments to
   assess the relative importance of the different uptake mechanisms to
   alleviate P limitation on biomass production. We find that active P
   uptake is an essential mechanism for sustaining P availability on long
   timescales, whereas biotic de-occlusion might serve as a buffer on
   timescales shorter than 10 000 yr. Although active P uptake is essential
   for reducing P losses by leaching, humid lowland soils reach P
   limitation after around 100 000 yr of soil evolution. Given the
   generalized modelling framework, our model results compare reasonably
   with observed or independently estimated patterns and ranges of P
   concentrations in soils and vegetation. Furthermore, our simulations
   suggest that P limitation might be an important driver of biomass
   production efficiency (the fraction of the gross primary productivity
   used for biomass growth), and that vegetation on old soils has a smaller
   biomass production rate when P becomes limiting. With this study, we
   provide a theoretical basis for investigating the responses of
   terrestrial ecosystems to P availability linking geological and
   ecological timescales under different environmental settings.}},

Abstract = {{Fungi are the agents primarily responsible for the transformation of
   plant-derived carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. However, little is known
   of their responses to the seasonal changes in resource availability in
   deciduous forests, including photosynthate allocation below ground and
   seasonal inputs of fresh litter. Vertical stratification of and seasonal
   changes in fungal abundance, activity and community composition were
   investigated in the litter, organic and upper mineral soils of a
   temperate Quercus petraea forest using ergosterol and extracellular
   enzyme assays and amplicon 454-pyrosequencing of the rDNA-ITS region.
   Fungal activity, biomass and diversity decreased substantially with soil
   depth. The highest enzyme activities were detected in winter, especially
   in litter, where these activities were followed by a peak in fungal
   biomass during spring. The litter community exhibited more profound
   seasonal changes than did the community in the deeper horizons. In the
   litter, saprotrophic genera reached their seasonal maxima in autumn, but
   summer typically saw the highest abundance of ectomycorrhizal taxa.
   Although the composition of the litter community changes over the course
   of the year, the mineral soil shows changes in biomass. The fungal
   community is affected by season. Litter decomposition and phytosynthate
   allocation represent important factors contributing to the observed

Abstract = {{We synthesised results on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes and
   the accumulation of soil organic C and N under adjacent 50-year-old
   Norway spruce, Scots pine and silver birch stands growing on similar
   soils and evaluated the different processes involved. C and N budgets
   were calculated. Spruce stands had larger stocks of C and N in biomass
   and soil than birch stands, with pine intermediate. The differences in
   soil stocks were mainly found in the organic layer, whereas differences
   in the mineral soil were small. The study showed that there is no simple
   answer to what is causing the differences in soil C and N stocks,
   because several processes are interacting. Spruce and pine trees had
   higher biomass and litter production than birch trees, but total litter
   inputs showed no significant difference between stands, because the rich
   ground vegetation under pine and birch contributed with substantial
   litter inputs, in contrast to the poor ground vegetation under spruce.
   Decomposition rate (per g of C) was markedly higher under birch than
   under spruce and pine resulting in lower C and N stocks in the organic
   layer. This effect was amplified by higher abundance and biomass of
   earthworms, favoured by higher pH and palatable litter under birch.
   Earthworm bioturbation probably both increased decomposition rate and
   damaged the ectomycorrhizal network with negative consequences for the
   formation of mycorrhizal litter and C storage. In conclusion, the direct
   effects of spruce, pine and birch litter on C and N pools and fluxes

Abstract = {{Microbial communities in litter and soil are the functional link through
   which the tree species occupying a site may alter rates of soil
   processes fundamental to nutrient cycling and carbon flux. Through
   differences in the nature of their litter, their mycorrhizal fungal
   associates and the exudates they release into the
   rhizo/mycorrhizosphere, different tree species may give rise to distinct
   microbial communities in litter and soil. We examine the evidence that
   tree species influence the composition of the microbial communities in
   decomposing litter, forest floors, soil and the rhizo/mycorrhizosphere.
   The microbial communities considered in this review include bacteria,
   archaea, fungi and both free-living and symbiotic organisms. There is
   evidence that distinct microbial communities develop on decomposing leaf
   litters of different tree species, however, given the well-documented
   succession of microbes on decomposing litter, comparisons amongst tree
   species of microbial communities in litters and forest floors at the
   same stage of decay are needed to definitively deduce the influence of
   tree species. Distinct microbial communities have been reported in
   forest floors under different tree species; differences are most
   pronounced in the F layer. Distinctions in microbial communities in
   mineral soil under different tree species have been determined in
   several common garden experiments. The main factors associated with
   differences in microbial communities in litter, forest floors and soil
   are the pH and base cation content of the litter and whether the trees
   are broadleaf or coniferous. Identified differences in microbial
   communities in the rhizospheres of different tree species are more
   likely to be differences in the mycorrhizospheres and hyphospheres,
   given the predominance of associations with mycorrhizal fungi. Distinct
   microbial communities have been identified in the mycorrhizosphere under
   different tree species; these are influenced both by the tree species
   and by the mycorrhizal fungi with which the tree associates. Heightened
   attention during sampling to ensure comparison of `like with like' could
   improve our ability to distinguish influence of tree species in
   decomposing litter, forest floors and soil. A significant remaining
   challenge is characterizing exudates from different tree-mycorrhizal
   fungi associations and understanding interactions between mycorrhizal
   fungi and microbial communities in the hyphosphere. A complete tapestry
   of the linkages between tree species and soil microbial communities
   requires that we also weave in the effects of soil fauna. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We synthesise a series of independent but integrated studies on the
   functioning of a mixed Mediterranean oak forest to demonstrate the
   tree-soil interactions underpinning a positive feedback process that
   sustains the coexistence of two oak species. The studies focused on the
   foliar functional traits, plant regeneration patterns, biogeochemical
   cycles, soil microbial biomass and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal
   diversity associated with the co-dominant evergreen Quercus suber and
   deciduous Quercus canariensis in a Mediterranean forest in southern
   Spain.
   Foliar attributes differed between oak species, with Q canariensis
   having higher nutrient content and lower carbon to nutrient ratios and
   leaf mass per area than Q. suber. These attributes reflected their
   distinct resource use strategies and adaptation to high and low
   resource-availability environments, respectively. Leaf-fall nutrient
   concentrations were higher in Q. canariensis than in Q. suber and were
   correlated with concentrations in the fresh leaves. Leaf-fall nutrient
   concentrations influenced nutrient return, leaf-fall decay rate and the
   proportion of nutrients released from decomposing leaf-fall, all of
   which were higher for Q canariensis than for Q. suber. This generated a
   differential net nutrient input into the soil that led to increased soil
   nutrient concentrations under the canopy of Q. canariensis as compared
   to Q suber. The fraction of slowly decomposing leaf-fall that builds up
   soil organic matter was higher for Q canariensis, further raising the
   nutrient and moisture retention of its soils. Differences between
   species in soil properties disappeared with increasing soil depth, which
   was consistent with the hypothesised leaf-fall-mediated effect.
   Tree-species-generated changes in soil properties had further impacts on
   soil organisms. Soil microbial biomass (Cmic) and nutrients (Nmic, Pmic)
   were higher under Q. canariensis than under Q sober and were positively
   related to soil moisture content and substrate availability
   (particularly soil N). The composition of the ECM fungal community
   shifted between the two oaks in response to changes in the soil
   properties, particularly soil Ca and pH. Lower ECM phylogenetic
   diversity and higher abundance of mycorrhizal species with saprophytic
   abilities were related to the greater soil fertility under Q.
   canariensis. Overall, the two oak species generated soil conditions that
   aligned with their resource-use strategies and would enhance their own
   competitive capabilities, potentially creating a positive feedback. The
   two Quercus created soil spatial heterogeneity that could enable their
   coexistence through spatial niche partitioning. This study demonstrates
   the critical role of aboveground-belowground interactions underpinning
   forest community composition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Exotic earthworms can profoundly alter soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)
   dynamics in northern temperate forests, but the mechanisms explaining
   these responses are not well understood. We compared the soil microbial
   community (SMC) composition (measured as PLFAs) and enzyme activity
   between paired earthworm-invaded and earthworm-free plots in northern
   hardwood forests of New York, USA. We hypothesized that differences in
   SMCs and enzyme activity between plots would correspond with differences
   in soil C content and C:N ratios. Relative abundance of several
   bacterial (mostly gram-positive) PLFAs was higher and that of two fungal
   PLFAs was lower in earthworm compared to reference plots, largely
   because of earthworm incorporation of the organic horizon into mineral
   soil. In surface mineral soil earthworms increased arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and gram-positive bacterial PLFAs, and decreased
   fungal (mostly saprotrophic) and several bacterial (gram-negative and
   non-specific) PLFAs. Earthworms also increased the activities of
   cellulolytic relative to lignolytic enzymes in surface mineral soil, and
   the relationships between enzyme activities and components of the SMC
   suggest a substrate-mediated effect on the SMC and its metabolism of C.
   A highly significant relationship between components of the SMC and soil
   C:N also suggests that earthworms reduce soil C:N through functional and
   compositional shifts in the SMC. Finally, changes in AMF abundances were
   linked to phosphatase activity, suggesting that earthworms do not
   necessarily inhibit P-acquisition by AMF-associated plants in our study
   system. We conclude that the combined influence of earthworm-related
   changes in physical structure, accessibility and chemistry of organic
   matter, and relative abundance of certain groups of fungi and bacteria
   promote C metabolism, in particular by increasing the activities of
   cellulolytic vs. lignolytic enzymes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Correctly estimating the trophic fractionation factors (Delta N-15 and

   large N-15/N-14 and small C-13/C-12 trophic fractionation, but in field
   studies litter-dwelling microarthropods and other invertebrates are
   consistently enriched in C-13 relative to plant litter. In the present
   study, we report data from two laboratory experiments investigating both
   fungi-collembolans and litter-fungi-collembolans systems. In the
   fungi-collembolans system, Delta N-15 and Delta C-13 averaged 1.4 +/- A
   0.1 and 1.0 +/- A 0.2 aEuro degrees, respectively. In microcosms with
   fungi-inoculated litter, the difference in delta N-15 between
   collembolans and plant litter averaged 1.5 +/- A 0.2 aEuro degrees,
   confirming the relatively small N-15/N-14 trophic fractionation at the
   basal level of detrital foodwebs reported in numerous field studies. In
   full agreement with field observations, the difference in delta C-13
   between bulk litter and collembolans in laboratory microcosms averaged
   3.6 +/- A 0.1 aEuro degrees and only little depended on collembolan
   species identities or the presence of water-soluble compounds in the

Abstract = {{The exotic plant, Eupatorium adenophorum, has invaded rapidly across
   southwest China, damaging native ecosystems and causing great economic
   losses. Soil microbes, as an important component of belowground
   community, can drive nutrient cycling and regulate plant competition in
   terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, knowledge of the soil microbial
   community and function will enhance our understanding of the mechanism
   of exotic plant invasive process in natural ecosystems. In this study,
   we examined the soil microbial community, soil enzyme activity, soil
   property and plant community along an invasive gradient of E.
   adenophorum in a southwest Chinese secondary forest. The soil analysis
   demonstrated that heavy invasion significantly increased the total P and
   NO (3) (-) -N contents, whereas it significantly decreased the total N
   and soil organic matter contents. The available P content was
   significantly decreased by moderate invasion. The E. adenophorum
   invasion significantly decreased the biomass of total soil microbes, as
   well as Gram-negative bacteria, actinomycetes, arbuscular mycorrhizal
   (AM) fungi and non-AM fungi. However, E. adenophorum invasion
   significantly increased the activities of soil urease, acid phosphatase,
   polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase. Non-metric multidimensional scaling
   showed that soil microbial composition and soil enzyme composition were
   significantly different in the three E. adenophorum invaded sites.
   Partial Mantel tests indicated that plant composition was the most
   important factor for structuring soil microbial and enzyme compositions.
   The results suggest that changes in soil microbial community structure
   and enzyme activity may play an important role in the process of E.
   adenophorum invasion in a Chinese secondary forest ecosystem.}},

   remaining in the same vegetation type) or more severe disturbance (soil
   cores transferred to a different vegetation type). The biomass and
   composition of the bacterial and fungal communities were measured for 2
   years following the establishment of the experiment.
   Minor disturbance (coring) had little impact on microbial biomass but
   transferring between vegetation type showed greater fungal biomass in
   soil incubated in the forest environment. The composition of bacterial
   communities was not influenced by coring but responded strongly to
   transfers between vegetation sites, changing to reflect their new
   environment after 2 years. Fungal community composition responded
   somewhat to coring, probably from disrupting mycorrhizal fungal hyphae,
   but more strongly to being transferred to a new environment.
   The response of the microbial community to major disturbance was rapid,
   showing shifts reflective of their new environment within 2 years,
   suggesting that microbial communities have the capacity to quickly
   adjust to catastrophic disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Symbiotic di-nitrogen (N-2) fixation is a critical biogeochemical
   process in tropical forests, yet it remains unresolved how fixation is
   controlled by the availability of soil nitrogen and phosphorus, two
   nutrients often considered limiting in terrestrial ecosystems. We
   examine whether individual N-2-fixing trees can overcome nitrogen and
   phosphorus constraints by employing different strategies of nutrient
   acquisition and use: N-2 fixation, phosphatase exudation, mycorrhizal
   symbiosis and changes in root-shoot ratio or tissue stoichiometry. We
   grew a common and widespread N-2 fixer, Inga punctata, in a full
   factorial nitrogen and phosphorus addition experiment (each nutrient at
   three levels) and evaluated whether trees adjusted their strategies of
   nutrient acquisition to overcome limitation. N-2 fixation was controlled
   by nitrogen availability in phosphorus-sufficient soils, but both
   fixation and plant growth were constrained by phosphorus in the
   unamended native phosphorus-poor soils. Despite the investment in both
   extracellular phosphatases and mycorrhizal symbionts, plants were unable
   to overcome phosphorus limitation. Our findings support the hypotheses
   that: (i) N-2 fixation is proximately controlled by nitrogen
   availability, consistent with a facultative fixation strategy, and (ii)
   N-2 fixation and N-2 fixer biomass growth are ultimately constrained by
   soil phosphorus. We found no support for the hypothesis that fixers can
   overcome phosphorus limitation by trading fixed N-2 for soil phosphorus.
   Synthesis. This study provides new knowledge about how nitrogen and
   phosphorus interact to regulate tropical N-2 fixation by examining a
   suite of strategies that plants may employ to overcome nutrient
   limitation. These findings, focused at the organismal level, have
   broader implications for biogeochemical controls at the ecosystem level
   in tropical forests.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature and substrate stoichiometry can influence soil organic
   matter (SUM) decomposition, but whether their interactive effect is
   significant remains unclear. This study explores linkages between
   substrate stoichiometry and warming-induced patterns of microbial carbon
   (C) mineralization in boreal forest soils via replacements of native
   litterfall with Oi material possessing distinct delta C-13 and C:N.
   Following 120 day incubations of soils from sites similar except for
   mean annual temperature, we examined exo-enzyme activities, microbial
   biomass, and delta C-13 of respired CO2 and individual phospholipid
   fatty acids (PLFA) to identify microbial community and decay responses
   to these experimental manipulations. In accordance with stoichiometric
   theory, we hypothesized that warming-induced increases in microbial use
   of naturally low C:N Oea materials and fungal incorporation of Oea would
   be enhanced when available Oi material exhibited relatively high C:N.
   These hypotheses were only partially supported. At the warmer site,
   higher C:N Oi was linked to an enhanced, warming-induced decline in
   Oi-derived CO2, lower C:N Oi prompted an increase in the warming-induced
   increase in phenol oxidase activities, and the interaction between
   temperature and Oi C:N had no influence on the relative abundances or
   activities of distinct microbial groups. In contrast, responses to Oi
   C:N and temperature at the cooler site were evident only via changes in
   the structure and substrate preference of the active microbial
   community; we observed a similar to 25\% increase in the incorporation
   of low C:N Oi into fungi relative to bacteria in these soils when they
   were incubated at a relatively high temperature. The data emphasize the
   importance of native climate imposing a legacy effect on how these
   microbial communities respond to temperature and substrate
   stoichiometry, by governing those communities' adaptive characteristics
   and the climate-related composition of the SUM on which they depend.
   That legacy effect is reflected in patterns of decay and in the relative
   abundances of microbial groups that both decay and generate SOM.

Abstract = {{The linkage between tree diversity and the soil food web in temperate
   deciduous forest ecosystems remains uncertain. Using microbial
   phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), we analyzed the effect of tree species
   composition on microbial communities from topsoil collected in Hainich
   National Park, Germany. Previous results had shown minimal direct
   effects of tree species on the microbial community in autumn, most
   likely due to low plant activity and high nutrient and energy input from
   litterfall. However, microbial composition was affected indirectly
   through an influence of tree species on soil pH. In this study, we
   analyzed PLFA profiles in early summer and compared them with the
   results from autumn sampling. We hypothesized that plant-based traits
   would have stronger direct effects on the abundance and structure of the
   microbial community during the photosynthetically active period. The
   results showed that the soil microbial community differed more markedly
   between the tree diversity levels in early summer than in autumn. The
   acidifying character of the decaying beech litter strongly influenced
   the soil pH values and structured the soil microbial community
   indirectly in early summer as it had in autumn. However, the measured
   differences in the microbial composition in early summer could be
   attributed primarily to litter quality. This direct influence of plant
   traits appeared to be eclipsed in autumn because of the high nutrient
   supply from fresh litter input. Following litter decomposition in the
   topsoil, however, litter-based plant traits emerged as a factor
   structuring the soil microbial community in early summer. Our results
   suggest that the PLFAs i14:0 and i15:0, indicative of Gram-positive
   bacteria, are strongly involved in decomposition processes and may be
   promoted by readily available nutrients. Furthermore, our results
   indicate that a dense root network in association with arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi strongly supported microbial growth in the more
   diverse forest stands. High proportions of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   (PLFA 16:1 omega 5), root-associated microorganisms PLFAs 16:1 omega 9,
   16:1 omega 7, 17:1 omega 8 and 18:1 omega 7) and bacterial grazers (PLFA
   20:5) characterized the microbial community in early summer on these
   study plots. We conclude that microbial communities are strongly
   influenced by abiotic controls. However, seasonal differences in litter
   decomposition rates and root activity should be considered in the
   analysis of the effects of tree diversity or species on soil microbial
   communities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In boreal and temperate forests fungi play a particularly important
   role, since most trees form a symbiotic relationship with many species
   of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, providing them with assimilates in
   exchange for minerals. Mycorrhiza is considered one of the most
   significant factors affecting functioning of forest ecosystems, and in
   particular the processes of carbon cycling and storage. ECM fungi are
   involved both directly through carbon accumulation in the mycelial
   system, and indirectly through their influence on tree biomass
   production and organic matter decomposition. The amount of carbon
   transferred to ECM fungi usually varies from 10 to 25 or even 50\% of
   the host's net photosynthesis, thus they are a group of organisms that
   significantly affect carbon flow into the soil. Most of that carbon is
   built into the mycelial system and its structures (fungal parts of ECM
   roots, extramatrical hyphae and rhizomorphs, sporocarps, etc.). Carbon
   allocation to the underground part of trees, and thus to ECM roots,
   changes with stand age and stand development phase. The biomass of
   active ECM roots and mycelium usually reaches its maximum in young
   stands, in the canopy closure phase; frequently, this is also true for
   the standing biomass of fruit bodies. A large share of ECM sporocarps in
   the forest carbon budget and high levels of ECM vegetative mycelium
   respiration are considered to be among the main pathways for the release
   of CO2 from forest soil, indicating a significant role of ECM fungi in
   fast carbon flow via forest ecosystems. On the other hand, dead ECM fine
   roots and extramatrical mycelia are a very rich and important pool of
   sequestered carbon in the soil.}},

Abstract = {{Various studies address changes in nitrogen and carbon cycling by exotic

   Therefore, we assessed the effects of the introduced Cinchona pubescens
   Vahl on plant and soil nutrients (especially phosphorus) in the
   highlands of Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos.
   Nutrient analyses were carried out on soil, leaf litter, and leaf
   samples taken from Cinchona, the endemic shrub Miconia robinsoniana
   Cogn. and the native fern Pteridium arachnoideum (Kaulf.) Maxon. in
   plots invaded and previously invaded by Cinchona.
   Cinchona contained significantly more nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium
   in its green leaves than Miconia. Surprisingly, there was no evidence of
   phosphorus resorption in senesced Cinchona leaves. This was also the
   case in Miconia leaves, but only in Cinchona-invaded plots. Specific
   leaf area of Cinchona was significantly higher than of Miconia and
   Pteridium leaves, as was its litter turnover rate. Total soil nitrogen,
   ammonium and available phosphorus concentrations were higher in the
   invaded plots. Leaf litter from these plots also contained more
   phosphorus, which was positively correlated with the phosphorus
   concentrations in the soil.
   These results suggest enhanced nutrient uptake by Cinchona and a faster
   decomposition of its litter, leading to increased nutrient availability
   in the soil. An accelerated cycling could promote spread of Cinchona and
   other introduced species, increasing the risk of further displacement of
   indigenous plant species in the Santa Cruz highlands.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of nitrogen in forest soils is found in organic
   matter-protein complexes. Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are thought to
   have a key role in decomposing and mobilizing nitrogen from such
   complexes. However, little is known about the mechanisms governing these
   processes, how they are regulated by the carbon in the host plant and
   the availability of more easily available forms of nitrogen sources.
   Here we used spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome profiling to
   examine how the presence or absence of glucose and/or ammonium regulates
   decomposition of litter material and nitrogen mobilization by the
   ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus. We found that the
   assimilation of nitrogen and the decomposition of the litter material
   are triggered by the addition of glucose. Glucose addition also resulted
   in upregulation of the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in
   oxidative degradation of polysaccharides and polyphenols, peptidases,
   nitrogen transporters and enzymes in pathways of the nitrogen and carbon
   metabolism. In contrast, the addition of ammonium to organic matter had
   relatively minor effects on the expression of transcripts and the
   decomposition of litter material, occurring only when glucose was
   present. On the basis of spectroscopic analyses, three major types of
   chemical modifications of the litter material were observed, each
   correlated with the expression of specific sets of genes encoding
   extracellular enzymes. Our data suggest that the expression of the
   decomposition and nitrogen assimilation processes of EMF can be tightly
   regulated by the host carbon supply and that the availability of
   inorganic nitrogen as such has limited effects on saprotrophic

Abstract = {{Acacia mearnsii is one of the most planted Australian Acacia around the
   world but is known to be highly invasive, threatening native habitats by
   competing with indigenous vegetation. The introduction of this species
   in the Algerian El Kala Biosphere reserve led to the invasion of natural
   formations to the detriment of Quercus suber, a native tree species. We
   hypothesized that shifts in soil microbial functions and ectomycorrhizal
   (EcM) fungal community structure triggered by this exotic Acacia species
   might correlate with a decrease of the early growth of Q suber. Soil
   samples were thus collected from 3 different sites where the exotic
   species was at different stages of invasion in the Algerian El Kala
   Biosphere reserve, (i) a Q suber forest free of A. mearnsii (site S1),
   (ii) a Q suber/A. mearnsii mixed forest where the Australian Acacia has
   been recently detected (site S2) and (iii) pure stands of A. mearnsii
   formed more than 20 years ago (site S3). Plant growth, EcM community
   structure associated with Q. suber roots and soil microbial
   functionalities were assessed for 6 month-old cultures of Q suber in
   glasshouse conditions. The results clearly demonstrated a strong
   deleterious impact of A. mearnsii invasion level on soil chemical
   characteristics, microbial functions and EcM community structure and
   colonization, correlated to a decrease in the early growth of Q suber
   seedlings. The current study gives new insights into both the negative
   impact of exotic species on soil functioning and their effect on
   indigenous vegetation growth. These results may be used as a basis for
   improving the conservation practices of native tree species in such
   degraded areas as a complement of ecological strategies using indigenous
   ectotrophic early-successional shrub species (eg. Cistus spp.) that our
   findings have shown to promote EcM multiplication and the early growth

Abstract = {{Disentangling biotic and abiotic drivers of wild mushroom fruiting is
   fraught with difficulties because mycelial growth is hidden belowground,
   symbiotic and saprotrophic supply strategies may interact, and
   myco-ecological observations are often either discontinuous or too
   short. Here, we compiled and analyzed 115417 weekly fungal fruit body
   counts from permanent Swiss inventories between 1975 and 2006. Mushroom
   fruiting exhibited an average autumnal delay of 12days after 1991
   compared with before, the annual number of fruit bodies increased from
   1801 to 5414 and the mean species richness doubled from 10 to 20. Intra-
   and interannual coherency of symbiotic and saprotrophic mushroom
   fruiting, together with little agreement between mycorrhizal yield and
   tree growth suggests direct climate controls on fruit body formation of
   both nutritional modes. Our results contradict a previously reported
   declining of mushroom harvests and propose rethinking the conceptual
   role of symbiotic pathways in fungi-host interaction. Moreover, this
   conceptual advancement may foster new cross-disciplinary research
   avenues, and stimulate questions about possible amplifications of the
   global carbon cycle, as enhanced fungal production in moist mid-latitude
   forests rises carbon cycling and thus increases greenhouse gas exchanges
   between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Previous research from the tropics indicates that AMF may be well
   adapted to organic soils and even represent the dominant mycorrhizal
   form, though the extraradical part of the symbiosis was omitted as in
   most other tropical studies. Our study aims at characterizing the
   extraradical part of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in a highly
   organic tropical montane forest soil in Southern Ecuador. Based on
   recent studies on the interaction of AM fungal hyphae and litter we
   hypothesized that within the organic layer AM hyphae grow in close
   contact with decomposing material. To test this idea, AM fungal hyphal
   distribution in the organic layer was determined by directly staining
   roots and decomposing leaves and extracting hyphae from the remaining
   particulate organic material. AM and non-AM fungal hyphae were analyzed,
   as well as root colonization patterns. Our results showed that AMF
   indeed represented the dominant mycorrhizal form with an average root
   colonization of 43\%. The extraradical AM hyphal length ranged from 2 to
   34 m g(-1) soil with a mean of 10.4 m g(-1) soil (equals 3.1 m cm(-3)
   soil), and therefore exceeded root length about 13-fold. As
   hypothesized, 29\% of AM extraradical hyphae were closely attached to
   decomposing leaves. These hyphae were mainly located at the leaf
   surface, though in some parts leaf veins and inner leaf tissues were
   colonized. More than half of AM hyphal biomass was detected on the root
   surface, a pattern potentially driven by the predominant Paris-type AMP.
   Non-AM fungal hyphae colonized decomposing material to a significantly
   greater extent, though hyphal length attached to roots was equal. This
   study supports the adaptation of AMF to highly organic soils in the
   tropics and the existence of a widespread extraradical mycelium, which
   is not readily detectable by standard methods. The close association
   with decomposing leaves most likely improves direct nutrient uptake from
   decomposed material and points to a potential indirect contribution of
   AMF to the decomposition process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) deposition on forests decreases the decomposition of
   organic matter, and may therefore decrease N mineralization. However, a
   higher N supply also meets the N demands of soil microbes, which may
   increase N mineralization, especially if the trees reduce their carbon
   allocation to mycorrhizal fungi and other biotic N sinks in the
   rhizosphere. We report effects of high continuous N load and of
   termination of N load on stem wood volume, foliar and soil chemistry,
   gross N turnover, and soil microbial communities in a boreal Norway
   spruce forest in Sweden. Ammonium nitrate had been applied annually for
   42 years at average rates of 34 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of N to the N1 plots,
   and for two decades at 73 and 108 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of N to N2 and N3
   plots, respectively. Treatments N2 and N3 were terminated 19 and 17
   years before the study, which enabled us to study the recovery from the
   previous high N load.
   Stem growth responded strongly to N additions and correlated to gross N
   mineralization and microbial community composition. Total stem volume
   measured in 2010 was 299, 483, 470, and 376 m(3) ha(-1), in NO
   (control), N1, N2, and N3 plots, respectively. In N-limited control
   plots with high soil C/N ratio and low soil and needle N concentrations,
   we observed lower gross N mineralization rate and lower recovery of
   non-immobilized tracer in the soil ammonium pool, which indicates a high
   microbial N immobilization capacity. Commonly, microbial biomarkers
   decline after N addition, which was also found here, whereas total
   abundance was highest in high N plots with thick mor-layer. Contrary to
   our expectation the fungi/bacteria ratio was not lower, because fungi
   and bacteria declined concurrently and to the same extent. As we
   expected, soils in N amended plots had higher relative amounts of
   gram-positive bacteria than in control plots. Termination of N additions
   caused a reduction in gross N mineralization and needle N. Lower N-15
   abundance in needles compared with the mor-layer indicated a recovery of
   the function of ectomy-corrhizal symbiosis.
   We propose that the higher gross N mineralization rate in N-loaded
   forest is not caused by greater decomposition of organic matter, but a
   higher internal turnover of microbial N. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Carbon and nitrogen accumulation in belowground tree biomass in a
   chronosequence of silver birch stands}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{302}},
Pages = {{62-70}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{An essential carbon (C) pool of forest ecosystems is stored in
   belowground tree biomass; however, data about belowground C and nutrient
   accumulation is scarce. It is crucial to involve belowground part for
   developing regional and global C or nitrogen (N) budgets for different
   forest ecosystems.
   Fine root (D < 2.0 mm) biomass and spatial allocation as well as coarse
   root (D >= 2.0 mm) biomass were studied in a chronosequence in four
   silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) stands aged 6-60 years.
   The soil coring method was used for estimation of birch fine root
   biomass and necromass in the upper 40 cm topsoil layer. Stump biomass
   and coarse root biomass were estimated by excavation of the root systems
   of model trees in a 6-year-old stand and in a 32-year-old silver birch
   stand. For a 14-year-old stand and for a 60-year-old stand, the
   developed root-shoot ratio approach was used. Carbon and nitrogen
   accumulation in belowground biomass was estimated as well.
   Fine root biomass varied between 103 g m(-2) and 409 g m(-2) and fine
   root necromass, between 22 g m(-2) and 93 g m(-2); both increased with
   stand age. Fine root vertical distribution showed a gradual decrease
   with soil depth in all profiles, however, fine root biomass shifted more
   to the deeper soil layers with increasing stand age. The fine root
   live/dead ratio decreased hyperbolically with stand age while the change
   was most rapid before pole age.
   The most active part of the fine root system - ectomycorrhizal biomass
   (EcMB) - was estimated for three stands (6-, 14- and 32-year-old); EcMB
   per basal area varied between 8 and 14 kg m(-2) and was not related to
   stand age.
   Coarse root biomass increased with stand age from 7.9 Mg ha(-1) in the
   6-year-old stand to 40.2 Mg ha(-1) in the 60-year-old stand. The
   root-shoot ratio decreased in silver birch stands drastically between 6
   and 14 years but stabilized thereafter. Hence the use of a root-shoot
   ratio of 21\% for calculation of belowground biomass from aboveground
   biomass for silver birch stands is justified.
   Carbon accumulation in the belowground tree biomass of silver birch
   stands varied between 4.0 Mg ha(-1) and 19.8 Mg ha(-1), being the
   highest in the 60-year-old stand. The C accumulated in belowground
   biomass accounted for 3-4\% of the total C storage of the total C
   storage of the forest ecosystem in the young stands and for 9.5-11\% in
   the middle-aged and mature stands. Fine root mortality and the
   corresponding C flow as fine-root litter input increased with stand age.
   As the biomass of the trees was the main C sink, a significant share
   (3-28\%) of C was accumulated in the belowground part of the stand. C
   accumulation in the fine roots was low in chronosequence birch stands;
   however the C flux into the soil through fine root litter may be
   considerable. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Our aims were to characterize the fate of leaf-litter-derived nitrogen
   in the plant-soil-microbe system of a temperate beech forest of Southern
   Germany and to identify its importance for N nutrition of beech
   seedlings.
   N-15-labelled leaf litter was traced in situ into abiotic and biotic N
   pools in mineral soil as well as into beech seedlings and mycorrhizal
   root tips over three growing seasons.
   There was a rapid transfer of N-15 into the mineral soil already 21 days
   after tracer application with soil microbial biomass initially
   representing the dominant litter-N sink. However, N-15 recovery in
   non-extractable soil N pools strongly increased over time and
   subsequently became the dominant N-15 sink. Recovery in plant biomass
   accounted for only 0.025 \% of N-15 excess after 876 days. After three
   growing seasons, N-15 excess recovery was characterized by the following
   sequence: non-extractable soil N >> extractable soil N including
   microbial biomass >> plant biomass > ectomycorrhizal root tips.
   After quick vertical dislocation and cycling through microbial N pools,
   there was a rapid stabilization of leaf-litter-derived N in
   non-extractable N pools of the mineral soil. Very low N-15 recovery in
   beech seedlings suggests a high importance of other N sources such as
   root litter for N nutrition of beech understorey.}},

Abstract = {{An ectomycorrhiza is a multitrophic association between a tree root, an
   ectomycorrhizal fungus, free-living fungi and the associated bacterial
   communities. Enzymatic activities of ectomycorrhizal root tips are
   therefore result of the contribution from different partners of the
   symbiotic organ. However, the functional potential of the
   fungus-associated bacterial communities remains unknown. In this study,
   a collection of 80 bacterial strains randomly selected and isolated from
   a soil-ectomycorrhiza continuum (oak-Scleroderma citrinum
   ectomycorrhizas, the ectomycorrhizosphere and the surrounding bulk soil)
   were characterized. All the bacterial isolates were identified by
   partial 16S rRNA gene sequences as members of the genera Burkholderia,
   Collimonas, Dyella, Mesorhizobium, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium and
   Sphingomonas. The bacterial strains were then assayed for
   beta-xylosidase, beta-glucosidase, N-acetyl-hexosaminidase,
   beta-glucuronidase, cellobiohydrolase, phosphomonoesterase,
   leucine-aminopeptidase and laccase activities, chitin solubilization and
   auxin production. Using these bioassays, we demonstrated significant
   differences in the functional distribution of the bacterial communities
   living in the different compartments of the soil-ectomycorrhiza
   continuum. The surrounding bulk soil was significantly enriched in
   bacterial isolates capable of hydrolysing cellobiose and
   N-acetylglucosamine. In contrast, the ectomycorrhizosphere appeared
   significantly enriched in bacterial isolates capable of hydrolysing
   glucopyranoside and chitin. Notably, chitinase and laccase activities
   were found only in bacterial isolates belonging to the Collimonas and
   Pseudomonas genera. Overall, the results suggest that the
   ectomycorrhizal fungi favour specific bacterial communities with
   contrasting functional characteristics from the surrounding soil.}},

   the major source of C for the fungal communities and influenced the
   composition of the microbial community and soil respiration rates up to
   ten meters into the clear-cut. When the input of labile plant C
   decreased, it appeared that microorganisms became increasingly dependent

   significant clustering of fungal communities by site and soil horizons

   Free-living saprotrophic fungi dominated the recently-shed leaf litter

Abstract = {{Aims We investigated the influence of tree species on the natural N-15

   Methods We analysed delta N-15 in litter, the forest floor and three
   mineral soil horizons along with ecosystem N status variables at six
   sites planted three decades ago with five European broadleaved tree
   species and Norway spruce.
   Results Litter delta N-15 and N-15 enrichment factor (delta
   N-15(litter)-delta N-15(soil)) were positively correlated with N status
   based on soil and litter N pools, nitrification, subsoil nitrate
   concentration and forest growth. Tree species differences were also
   significant for these N variables and for the litter delta N-15 and
   enrichment factor. Litter from ash and sycamore maple with high N status
   and low fungal mycelia activity was enriched in N-15 (+0.9 delta units)
   relative to other tree species (European beech, pedunculate oak, lime
   and Norway spruce) even though the latter species leached more nitrate.
   Conclusions The delta N-15 pattern reflected tree species related traits
   affecting the N cycling as well as site fertility and former land use,
   and possibly differences in N leaching. The tree species delta N-15
   patterns reflected fractionation caused by uptake of N through
   mycorrhiza rather than due to nitrate leaching or other N transformation

Abstract = {{The spatiotemporal dynamics of, and interspecific differences in, the
   acquisition of litter-derived nitrogen (N) by natural assemblages of
   ectomycorrhizal root tips are poorly understood. Small cylindrical mesh
   bags containing 15N-labelled beech (Fagus sylvatica) leaf litter that
   permit hyphal but not root ingrowth were inserted vertically into the
   top soil layer of an old-growth beech forest. The lateral transfer of
   15N into the circumjacent soil, roots, microbes and ectomycorrhizas was
   measured during an 18-month exposure period. Ectomycorrhial fungi (EMF)
   showed large interspecific variation in the temporal pattern and extent
   of 15N accumulation. Initially, when N was mainly available from the
   leachate, microbes were more efficient at N immobilization than the
   majority of EMF, but distinct fungal species also showed significant 15N
   accumulation. During later phases, the enrichment of 15N in Tomentella
   badia was higher than in microbes and other EMF species. Roots and soil
   accumulated 15N with a large delay compared with microbes and EMF.
   Because approximately half of the studied fungal species had direct
   access to N from leaf litter and the remainder to N from leached
   compounds, we suggest that EMF diversity facilitates the N utilization
   of the host by capturing N originating from early-released solutes and
   late degradation products from a recalcitrant source.}},

Title = {{Incorporation of plant carbon and microbial nitrogen into the
   rhizosphere food web of beech and ash}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{76-81}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We labeled tree saplings of beech and ash with N-15 and C-13 in a
   greenhouse. Carbon (C) was applied as (CO2)-C-13 to plants and nitrogen
   (N) was added as (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 to the soil. We hypothesized that C
   will be transferred from plants to the rhizosphere, subsequently in
   beech to ectomycorrhiza (EM), in ash to arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and
   finally to soil animals. We expected the C signal to be more effectively
   transferred to soil animals in EM as compared to AM systems since EM
   forms more extensive extramatrical mycelia as compared to AM. For N-15
   we hypothesized that it will be taken up by both saprotrophic
   microorganisms and mycorrhizal fungi and then channeled to-soil animals.
   After five month, delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of soil animals,
   EM and fine roots of beech and ash were measured. Litter and soil were
   hardly enriched in N-15 whereas fine roots of beech and ash were highly
   enriched suggesting that nitrogen in (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 was
   predominantly taken up by plants and mycorrhizal fungi but little by
   saprotrophic microorganisms. Roots of beech and ash were highly enriched
   in C-13 with maximum values in EM proving that C-13 was translocated
   into roots and mycorrhizal fungi. Soil animals were a priori assigned to
   primary decomposers, secondary decomposers and predators. Generally,
   signatures of soil animals did not significantly vary between beech and
   ash and therefore were pooled. Primary decomposers had low delta C-13
   and delta N-15 signatures similar to litter and soil confirming that
   rhizosphere C and microbial N are of limited importance for primary
   decomposer taxa. delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of secondary
   decomposers were higher than those of primary decomposers and spanned a
   large gradient indicating that certain secondary decomposers rely on
   root derived C and microbial N, however, none of the secondary
   decomposers had signatures pointing to exclusive feeding on EM.
   Unexpectedly, delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures were highest in
   predators suggesting that they heavily preyed on secondary decomposer
   species such as the litter dwelling Collembola species Lepidocyrtus
   cyaneus and species not captured by the heat extraction procedure used
   for capturing prey taxa, presumably predominantly root associated
   nematodes. Overall, the results highlight that in particular higher
   trophic levels rely on carbon originating from other resources than
   litter with these resources channeled to dominant predators via litter
   dwelling Collembola species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical forests have high rates of soil carbon cycling, but little
   information is available on how roots, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi

   community composition, microbial carbon utilization, and hydrolytic
   enzyme activities for large, potted tropical trees and (2) enzyme
   activities and litter mass loss in a lowland tropical forest. Under the
   tropical tree, plant-derived carbon was incorporated predominantly into
   bacterial groups in both rhizosphere and AMF-only soils. Gram-positive
   bacteria incorporated additional soil-derived carbon in rhizosphere
   soils, which also contained the highest microbial biomass. For
   hydrolytic enzymes, -glucosidase and N-acetyl -glucosaminidase
   activities were highest in rhizosphere soils, while phosphomonoesterase
   activity was highest in AMF-only soil. In the forest, leaf litter mass
   loss was increased by the presence of roots, but not by the presence of
   AMF mycelia only. Root-microbial interactions influenced organic matter
   cycling, with evidence for rhizosphere priming and accelerated leaf
   litter decomposition in the presence of roots. Although AMF mycelia
   alone did not stimulate organic matter mineralization, they were a
   conduit of carbon to other soil microorganisms.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the context dependence of ecosystem responses to global
   changes requires the development of new conceptual frameworks. Here we
   propose a framework for considering how tree species and their
   mycorrhizal associates differentially couple carbon (C) and nutrient
   cycles in temperate forests. Given that tree species predominantly
   associate with a single type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi), and that the two
   types of fungi differ in their modes of nutrient acquisition, we
   hypothesize that the abundance of AM and ECM trees in a plot, stand, or
   region may provide an integrated index of biogeochemical transformations
   relevant to C cycling and nutrient retention. First, we describe how
   forest plots dominated by AM tree species have nutrient economies that
   differ in their C-nutrient couplings from those in plots dominated by
   ECM trees. Secondly, we demonstrate how the relative abundance of AM and
   ECM trees can be used to estimate nutrient dynamics across the
   landscape. Finally, we describe how our framework can be used to
   generate testable hypotheses about forest responses to global change
   factors, and how these dynamics can be used to develop better
   representations of plant-soil feedbacks and nutrient constraints on

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{36-45}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Positive relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
   are reported in many studies. The underlying mechanisms are, however,
   only little understood, likely due to the focus on the aboveground
   system and neglecting species-specific traits. We used different
   clusters of tree species composition to investigate how tree species
   diversity and tree species identity affect belowground nematode
   communities. Since soil nematodes comprise different trophic groups and
   are strongly linked to the microbial community, results can provide
   insight on how soil food webs are structured. In addition, data on leaf
   litter and fine root biomass were included to account for different
   effects of aboveground and belowground resources. Clusters of three
   trees of one, two and three species were identified within a temperate
   deciduous forest. Target tree species were European beech (Fagus
   sylvatica), common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and lime (Tilia cordata, T.
   platyphyllos) differing in physiology, leaf litter quality and type of
   mycorrhiza. Tree species identity strongly affected nematode trophic
   structure, whereas tree Species diversity had no impact. Ash
   beneficially affected bacterial-feeding nematodes, whereas fungal
   feeders were suppressed, likely caused by ash litter increasing soil pH.
   Fostering of the bacterial food chain by ash additionally could be
   related to rhizodeposition gaining importance after disappearance of
   high quality ash litter in spring, highlighting seasonal shifts in root
   and leaf litter-derived resources. The negative effect of ash on
   fungal-feeding nematodes is suggested to be due to the lack of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi as ash roots only form arbuscular mycorrhiza. In
   contrast, beech benefited fungal feeders and detrimentally affected
   bacterial feeders due to more acidic soil conditions that increase the
   competitive strength of fungi. Lime tended to negatively impact total
   nematode density but positively influenced plant-feeding nematodes.
   Generally, beech and ash strongly but opposingly influenced the trophic
   structure of nematode communities suggesting that changes in tree
   species identity result in major shifts in the channeling of energy
   through decomposer food webs. The results indicate that the structure of
   soil food webs varies markedly with tree species and point to the
   importance of basal resources, i.e., leaf litter and rhizodeposits. This
   suggests bottom-up forces mediated by individual tree species to control
   major decomposition pathways rather than tree diversity. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Natural forest disturbance regimes are changing, as evidenced by
   expansion of the mountain pine beetle (MPB) north and east from British
   Columbia into pine forests east of the Canadian Rockies. Thus, research
   that examines potential impacts of shifting disturbance regimes on
   ecosystem properties and processes in these forests is needed. We
   examined short-term effects (up to one year after treatment) of three
   treatments that emulated MPB attack and associated forest management
   disturbance (i.e., moderate and high intensity simulated MPB attack,
   salvage harvest) on above-and below-ground properties and processes of
   mature lodgepole pine forests in MPB's recently expanded range east of
   the Rockies. While the salvage logging treatment showed dramatic effects
   on the understory plant community and downed woody material with several
   less dramatic below-ground responses, there were no effects of the
   moderate MPB attack, and only limited below-ground responses to the high
   intensity attack. The salvage logged stands showed decreases in species
   richness and understory plant cover, increases in small downed wood,
   litter cover, forest floor pH, and plant available Ca, Mg, and P, and
   differences in multiple microbial properties compared with the other
   treatments. The high intensity simulated MPB attack showed increased
   respiration rates of several carbon substrates compared with the salvage
   treatment. There was considerable variation among years for many
   below-ground variables (e.g., multiple soil nutrients, microbial
   respiration rates and phospholipid fatty acids), and these were
   unrelated to treatments. For the majority of below-ground response
   variables, differences among study years rather than differences due to
   the MPB treatments suggest that inter-annual variability exerts a
   stronger influence than does disturbance effects of MPB red attack. The
   lack of potential response to MPB attack in the short-term suggests
   these forests are resistant to change early after attack, and/or have
   high ecological inertia. In contrast, salvage logging had immediate and
   dramatic effects. We don't yet know how these pine forests will develop
   under this modified disturbance regime of partial canopy disturbance,
   but it appears likely that salvage logging will push these stands in a
   potentially very different direction than the modified natural
   disturbance regime due to MPB will.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence of the importance of extramatrical mycelium
   (EMM) of mycorrhizal fungi in carbon (C) cycling in ecosystems. However,
   our understanding has until recently been mainly based on laboratory
   experiments, and knowledge of such basic parameters as variations in
   mycelial production, standing biomass and turnover as well as the
   regulatory mechanisms behind such variations in forest soils is limited.
   Presently, the production of EMM by ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi has been
   estimated at similar to 140 different forest sites to be up to several
   hundreds of kg per ha per year, but the published data are biased
   towards Picea abies in Scandinavia. Little is known about the standing
   biomass and turnover of EMM in other systems, and its influence on the C
   stored or lost from soils. Here, focussing on ectomycorrhizas, we
   discuss the factors that regulate the production and turnover of EMM and
   its role in soil C dynamics, identifying important gaps in this
   knowledge. C availability seems to be the key factor determining EMM
   production and possibly its standing biomass in forests but direct
   effects of mineral nutrient availability on the EMM can be important.
   There is great uncertainty about the rate of turnover of EMM. There is
   increasing evidence that residues of EM fungi play a major role in the
   formation of stable N and C in SOM, which highlights the need to include
   mycorrhizal effects in models of global soil C stores.}},

Abstract = {{This study was undertaken to investigate laccase-containing
   basidiomycete communities at the cDNA and DNA levels and to assess the
   influences of vegetation and soil types on the basidiomycete communities
   in forest soils.
   Soil samples were collected from the upper soil layers of two typical
   subtropical forests (a broad-leaved forest developed in Karst limestone
   soil and an artificial coniferous forest with Pinus massoniana in red
   soil) in China. The basidiomycete communities were characterized by
   cloning and sequencing of the laccase genes at both the cDNA and DNA
   levels. Compositions of lignin monomers were determined by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry.
   Most of the laccase genes obtained in this study were new, highlighting
   the research gap of this functional group. The trends of the
   basidiomycetous laccase gene diversity among the upper soil layers of
   the two forests were consistent between the cDNA and DNA levels. The
   Agaricales had high activity because they dominated all the tested
   soils. However, the total basidiomycete communities reflected at the
   cDNA and DNA levels were significantly different due to the presence of
   some quiescent basidiomycetous groups. Almost all of the lignin
   components were decomposed from the O to the A layers in the two
   forests, and laccases produced by Agaricales were likely responsible for
   the decomposition of guaiacyl monomers. Both vegetation and soil types
   had great influences on the active laccase-containing basidiomycete
   communities, primarily via the pH, C/N, and the contents of lignin
   monomers.
   The cDNA- and DNA-level approaches presented good consistency of
   diversities but different compositions of laccase-containing
   basidiomycete communities, thus emphasizing the importance of focusing
   on laccase genes at the cDNA level in future studies. It is the quality
   but not the quantity of SOM to determine the diversity and composition
   of the active laccase-containing basidiomycete communities.}},

Abstract = {{Many microfungi are able to live in living plant tissues. In contrast to
   plant pathogens and parasites the so-called endophytic fungi do not
   cause obvious disease symptoms in their hosts. Nevertheless, they
   constitute an ubiquitous active component in direct and multitrophic
   interactions. The present study was conducted to assess the level of
   overlap of cultivable microfungi in living and decaying tissues of
   European Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) from a forest stand in North-Eastern
   Germany. The focus lay on the hypothesized fall-spring relationship of
   leaf-inhabiting forest endophytes, which means that endophytes from
   autumn leaves persist as saprobes in litter or dead wood, sporulate and
   re-invade living leaves in spring. Fungal cultures were isolated from
   living leaves, leaf litter and dead wood still attached to the tree by
   dilution-to-extinction cultivation in the years 2007-2010. Analyses of
   species identity, species richness and species composition were based on
   microscopic identification and of sequencing the fungal DNA `barcode'
   ITS (internal transcribed spacer). Species richness of litter-inhabiting
   microfungi equaled that of wood-inhabiting fungi and exceeded that of
   leaf endophytes. The most distinctive species assemblage was observed on
   wood, fungal species composition in living leaves and leaf litter were
   also significantly different from each other. On the other hand a
   considerable compositional and phylogenetic overlap between leaf and
   litter fungi was revealed with phylogenetics, cluster analysis and
   non-metric multidimensional scaling. The taxa accounting most to the
   similarity between living and decaying leaves belonged to Capnodiales,
   Xylariales, Diaporthales and Pleosporales. Finally, data from cultivated
   leaf-inhabiting beech endophytes were compared with a fungal 454
   sequence data set from beech phyllosphere. This analysis allowed the
   partition of species lists into active fungal endophytes, fungal
   ``epiphytes{''} and dormant fungal propagules.}},

Title = {{Interactive Effects of Nitrogen and Phosphorus on Soil Microbial
   Communities in a Tropical Forest}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Elevated nitrogen (N) deposition in humid tropical regions may
   exacerbate phosphorus (P) deficiency in forests on highly weathered
   soils. However, it is not clear how P availability affects soil microbes
   and soil carbon (C), or how P processes interact with N deposition in
   tropical forests. We examined the effects of N and P additions on soil
   microbes and soil C pools in a N-saturated old-growth tropical forest in
   southern China to test the hypotheses that (1) N and P addition will
   have opposing effects on soil microbial biomass and activity, (2) N and
   P addition will alter the composition of the microbial community, (3)
   the addition of N and P will have interactive effects on soil microbes
   and (4) addition-mediated changes in microbial communities would feed
   back on soil C pools. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used
   to quantify the soil microbial community following four treatments:
   Control, N addition (15 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), P addition (15 g P m(-2)
   yr(-1)), and N\&P addition (15 g N m(-2) yr(-1) plus 15 g P m(-2)
   yr(-1)). These were applied from 2007 to 2011. Whereas additions of P
   increased soil microbial biomass, additions of N reduced soil microbial
   biomass. These effects, however, were transient, disappearing over
   longer periods. Moreover, N additions significantly increased relative
   abundance of fungal PLFAs and P additions significantly increased
   relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi PLFAs. Nitrogen
   addition had a negative effect on light fraction C, but no effect on
   heavy fraction C and total soil C. In contrast, P addition significantly
   decreased both light fraction C and total soil C. However, there were no
   interactions between N addition and P addition on soil microbes. Our
   results suggest that these nutrients are not co-limiting, and that P
   rather than N is limiting in this tropical forest.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 9}},
Abstract = {{Increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and rates of
   nitrogen (N)-deposition to forest ecosystems are predicted to alter the
   structure and function of soil fungal communities, but the spatially
   heterogeneous distribution of soil fungi has hampered investigations
   aimed at understanding such impacts. We hypothesized that soil physical
   and chemical properties and fungal community composition would be
   differentially impacted by elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) and
   N-fertilization in spatially separated field samples, in the forest
   floor, 0-2,2-5, and 5-10 cm depth intervals in a loblolly pine Free-Air
   Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiment. In all soils, quantitative
   PCR-based estimates of fungal biomass were highest in the forest floor.
   Fungal richness, based on pyrosequencing of the fungal ribosomal large
   subunit gene, increased in response to N-fertilization in 0-2 cm and
   forest floor intervals. Composition shifted in forest floor, 0-2 and 2-5
   cm intervals in response to N-fertilization, but the shift was most
   distinct in the 0-2 cm interval, in which the largest number of
   statistically significant changes in soil chemical parameters (i.e.,
   phosphorus, organic matter, calcium, pH) was also observed. In the 0-2
   cm interval, increased recovery of sequences from the Thelephoraceae,
   Tricholomataceae, Hypocreaceae, Clavicipitaceae, and Herpotrichiellaceae
   families and decreased recovery of sequences from the Amanitaceae
   correlated with N-fertilization. In this same depth interval,
   Amanitaceae, Tricholomataceae, and Herpotriciellaceae sequences were
   recovered less frequently from soils exposed to eCO(2) relative to
   ambient conditions. These results demonstrated that vertical
   stratification should be taken into consideration in future efforts to
   elucidate environmental impacts on fungal communities and their
   feedbacks on ecosystem processes.}},

   understory and groundcover species}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{293}},
Pages = {{39-48}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Humans have altered the global nitrogen (N) cycle, greatly increasing
   atmospheric nitrogen deposition in industrialized regions of the world.
   Groundcover plants can be sensitive indicators of nitrogen deposition
   impacts. Here, we report results from repeated measurements over a 7
   year period of groundcover (plants <1.4 m tall) and understory (plants
   with a diameter <5 cm at 1.4 m in height) vegetation in four mature
   northern hardwood forests in the north-central United States receiving
   experimental additions of N (3 g m(-2) year(-1) as NaNO3 for 18 years).
   Experimental N deposition reduced the average abundance of sugar maple
   (Acer saccharum Marsh.) seedlings in the groundcover by >50\% (P <
   0.001). This reduction occurred at all four sites, but was only
   statistically significant at the two sites where these seedlings were
   most abundant (site x nitrogen: P < 0.001). Our observations of
   mortality within a large cohort of sugar maple seedlings across three
   sites provide further evidence of this effect. For these seedlings,
   experimental N deposition significantly (P < 0.05) increased mortality
   in the weeks following germination, as well as over the longer term,
   reducing overall survival after 5 years by almost 90\%. Although
   groundcover plants accounted for <0.5\% of aboveground plant biomass,
   they contributed up to 10\% of ecosystem leaf area and 5\% of
   aboveground litter. At the two sites where sugar maple seedlings were
   infrequent, understory vegetation was more abundant and dominated by
   hop-hornbeam (Ostrya virginiana (Miller) K. Koch; 42\% of all stems). At
   these two sites, experimental N deposition significantly reduced the
   abundance of understory hop-hornbeam by more than 75\% (site x nitrogen:
   P = 0.008). The effects of experimental N deposition on the understory
   and groundcover vegetation occurred without significant decreases in
   reproductive litter or increases in canopy leaf area. Instead, the
   negative effects are more likely a by-product of other documented
   changes caused by the experimental N deposition: increased forest floor
   mass, decreased mycorrhizal abundance, and increased production of
   potentially alleopathic phenolic compounds. Because the
   late-successional species in these forests rely upon groundcover and
   understory plants for regeneration, the effects of added N on this
   vegetation have potential implications for future forest composition,
   particularly given the likely loss of some species in these forests due
   to exotic pests and pathogens. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Organic horizons of old-growth Douglas-fir {[}Pseudotsuga menziesii
   (Mirb.) Franco] forests are colonized by ectomycorrhizal fungi, which
   can form large patches or mats. Respiration, N mineralization, chitinase
   activity, and amino sugar C and N turnover are higher in soils colonized
   by ectomycorrhizal mats. To test if microbial activity in mat soil is
   driven by decomposition of fungal biomass, we incubated mat and non-mat
   soil with (CN)-C-13-N-15-labeled, chitin-enriched fungal cell wall
   material. Cell wall material was readily decomposed during 22-d
   incubations in both soils, and cell-wall-derived C-13 and N-15 were
   traced into mineralized pools, extractable organic pools, microbial
   biomass, and microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Basal microbial
   activity was higher in mat soils. Although total respiration was higher
   in mat soils with cell walls added, more cell wall C was mineralized in
   non-mat than mat soils; this was inferred to reflect greater
   preferential respiration of cell wall C over soil organic matter (SOM).
   Mineralization of N from cell wall material was low, with no difference
   between soils, and positive priming of N mineralization from SOM
   occurred after 3 wk. Both the proportion of cell wall N assimilated and
   N growth yield efficiency (GYE) were higher than for cell wall C. The
   relative abundance of fungi was higher in cell-wall-amended soils, and
   cell-wall-derived C-13 was found in fungal and Gram-negative bacterial
   PLFAs. Cell wall C assimilation and C GYE were higher in mat soils,
   which could be linked to greater mineralization of SOM or to
   differential activity of select microbial taxonomic groups. Chitin-rich
   fungal cell wall material was utilized as both a microbial N and C
   source; N was predominantly assimilated and C was predominantly
   metabolized. It is possible that fungal necromass may contribute to N

Abstract = {{Upland oak forests in the ecotone between the eastern deciduous forest
   and the southern Great Plains are threatened by encroachment of eastern
   redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) due to fire suppression. The rapid rate
   of encroachment caused concern about concomitant alterations of site
   characteristics including nutrient cycling and the soil microbial
   communities (SMC) that could lead to positive feedbacks reinforcing
   eastern redcedar encroachment. We studied eight upland oak forests
   across central and western Oklahoma with stands representing three
   levels of encroachment: oak-dominated, eastern redcedar-dominated, and
   an intermediate mixture of both species. We analyzed litter chemistry
   (carbon, lignin, and nitrogen), soil chemistry (soil organic matter,
   NH4N, NO3-N, PO4, K, and pH), and profiled soil microbial communities
   using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA). Eastern redcedar
   encroachment was accompanied by reduced litter carbon along with higher
   levels of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi while litter N was lower in
   mixed stands. However, we detected no change in soil chemistry. Our
   results indicate eastern redcedar encroachment in these upland oak
   forests reduced litter quality and altered the SMC through increases in
   AM fungi, a symbiont associated with eastern redcedar. These alterations
   may create positive soil-microbial feedbacks by reducing the fitness of
   the dominant oak species and facilitating rapid increase in eastern
   redcedar in this threatened, oak-dominated ecosystem. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   typically low. We compared two sites on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo, which
   contrast in soil age (the Tertiary versus Quaternary period). The older
   site had a much thicker soil organic matter and reduced N availability.
   Soil solution was collected from twenty lysimeters that were installed
   at two depths (10 cm and 50 cm) at each of ten random locations at each
   site, and was fractionated into hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions.
   The hydrophobic fraction was hydrolyzed to determine the concentration
   of bound N as amino acids. The mean concentration of phenolics was five
   times greater in soil solution of the upper horizon at the older N-poor
   site compared to the younger N-rich site. The mean concentration of
   hydrolyzed amino acids was twice greater in the upper horizon at the
   older N-poor site than that at the younger N-rich site; phenolics and
   amino acids were significantly greater under conifers than under
   non-conifers within the older site. DOC:DON ratio in soil solution was
   wider at the older N-poorer site (56) than at the younger N-richer site

   that more protein-polyphenol complexes (PPC) in soil solution are formed

Abstract = {{The relative roles of ectomycorrbizal (ECM) and saprotrophic communities
   in controlling the decomposition of soil organic matter remain unclear.
   We tested the hypothesis that ECM community structure and activity
   influences the breakdown of nutrient-rich biopolymers in soils, while
   saprotrophic communities primarily regulate the breakdown of carbon-rich
   biopolymers. To test this hypothesis, we used high-throughput techniques
   to measure ECM and saprotrophic community structure, soil resource
   availability, and extracellular enzyme activity in whole soils and on
   ECM root tips in a coastal pine forest. We found that ECM and saprotroph
   richness did not show spatial structure and did not co-vary with any
   soil resource. However, species richness of ECM fungi explained
   variation in the activity of enzymes targeting recalcitrant N sources
   (protease and peroxidase) in bulk soil. Activity of carbohydrate- and
   organic P- targeting enzymes (e.g. cellobiohydrolase, beta-glucosidase,
   alpha-glucosidase, hemicellulases, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, and acid
   phosphatase) was correlated with saprotroph community structure and soil
   resource abundance (total soil C, N, and moisture), both of which varied

Abstract = {{Massive moth outbreaks cause large-scale damage in subarctic mountain
   birch forests with a concomitant decrease in carbon flux to mycorrhizal
   fungi and an increased deposition of dissolved carbon and nutrients as
   moth frass into soil. We investigated impacts of moth herbivory along
   three replicated gradients with three levels of moth herbivory
   (undamaged, once damaged, repeatedly damaged) on soil nutrient levels
   and biological parameters. We found an increase in soil nutrients and in
   the biomass of enchytraeid worms, which are key faunal decomposers.
   Fungi : bacteria ratio and C:N ratio decreased in humus with increasing
   severity of herbivory. Our findings suggest enhanced resource turnover
   in mountain birch forests due to massive moth herbivory. This may
   provide a shortcut for carbon and nutrient input to subarctic soils,
   which largely bypasses the main routes of carbon from plants to soil via
   mycorrhizal and litter-decomposing fungi. Moreover, a temporal shift
   occurs in carbon allocation to soil, providing decomposers an
   opportunity to use an early-season peak in resource availability. Our
   results suggest a hitherto unappreciated role of massive insect
   herbivore attacks on resource dynamics in subarctic ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated atmospheric CO2 was often shown to stimulate belowground C
   allocation, but it is uncertain if this increase also alters the
   structure of soil microbial communities. Here, we assessed the effects
   of nine years of CO2 enrichment on soil microbial communities of an
   alpine treeline ecosystem with 35-year-old Lath decidua and Pinus mugo
   ssp. uncinata trees. We also tracked the C-13 signal of supplemental CO2
   in soil-respired CO2, microbial biomass, and phospholipid fatty acids
   (PLFA) in undisturbed mor-type organic layers. We found a persistently
   increased soil CO2 efflux (+24\% on average), but negligible effects of
   elevated CO2 on the biomass and community structure of soil
   microorganisms under both tree species determined with PLFA and T-RFLP
   (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism). The C-13 tracing
   over 9 years revealed that 24-40\% of the soil microbial biomass was
   composed of `new' plant-derived C. PLFA from gram-negative biomarkers
   did not significant shift in C-13 by the CO2 addition, while those of
   gram-negative bacteria were significantly altered. The highest C-13
   signals in individual PLFA was found in the fatty acid 18:26)6,9 with
   65-80\% new C, indicating that new plant-derived C was primarily
   incorporated by soil fungi. However, CO2 enrichment did not affect the
   production of mycelia biomass and the structure and composition of the
   fungal communities analysed by high-throughput 454-sequencing of genetic
   markers. Collectively, our results suggest that C flux through the plant
   soil system will be accelerated but that the biomass and composition of
   microbial communities will be little affected by rising atmospheric CO2

Abstract = {{Soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling are sensitive to changes in

   study was conducted to quantify the effects of belowground particulate
   litter (BPL) addition, increased precipitation and their interactions on
   soil C and N mineralization in two adjacent sites where belowground
   photosynthate allocation was manipulated through vegetation clipping in
   a temperate steppe of northeastern China from 2010 to 2011. The results
   show that BPL addition significantly increase soil C mineralization rate
   (CMR) and net N mineralization rate (NMR). Although increased
   precipitation-induced enhancement of soil CMR essentially ceased after
   the first year, stimulation of soil NMR and net nitrification rate
   continued into the second year. Clipping only marginally decreased soil
   CMR and NMR during the two years. There were significant synergistic
   interactions between BPL addition (and increased precipitation) and
   clipping on soil CMR and NMR, likely to reflect shifts in soil microbial
   community structure and a decrease in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   biomass due to the reduction of belowground photosynthate allocation.
   These results highlight the importance of plants in mediating the

   experiments were carried out in 2009-2010 at forest nursery Biale Biota
   (Forest District Bydgoszcz) on the rusty soil. The whole area of the
   experiment was irrigated with the use of stationary sprinlding machine.
   The soil was characterized by the alkaline reaction (pH in H2O was in
   the range 7.2-7.4), the low content of available potassium and available
   phosphorus as well as the content of C-org from 35.7 to 38.4 g-kg(-1).
   The C:N ratio ranged from 14.3 to 14.9. Two-and three-year old seedlings
   of littleleaf linden grown on plots fertilized with the compost were
   higher than those cultivated on plots with mineral fertilizer and they
   were also characterized by the higher number of leaves and the higher
   leaf area. Mulching which was carried out in September of the first
   growing season - did not influence significantly on the growth
   parameters of two-year old seedlings (with the exception of the decrease
   in a leaf area). In the third growing season the mulching significantly
   influenced on all the seedling growth parameters tested, and -
   furthermore - there was also a significant interaction between the both
   studied treatments in shaping of the all growth parameters (with the
   exception of the plant height) of littleleaf linden seedlings. The
   density of mites in the soil was distinctly increased after the
   mulch-ing treatment, and it was many fold higher as compared to the
   control plot MC. On the base of the analysis it was found that the
   mulching and the fertilization with compost prepared from municipal
   sewage sludge influenced positively on the abundance of mites,
   especially oribatid mites as well as on their species diversity.
   Tectocepheus velatus was the most abundant species among the oribatid
   mites on all the stands of littleleaf linden cultivation. Abundance
   dynamics of this oribatid species in the two-years period of the study,

Abstract = {{Truffle-like fungi are highly diverse yet poorly known in Australia. To
   assess the species richness, biomass, and community assemblages of
   truffle-like fungi in different habitats we sampled sporocarps of
   truffle-like fungi in three eucalypt-dominated forest types (grassy
   woodland, wet sclerophyll forest, and dry sclerophyll forest) once in
   summer and once in winter, at two sites (Mount Kaputar and New England)
   in northern New South Wales, Australia. One hundred and eighteen species
   in 35 genera were collected; over half (51.7 \%) of the species were
   undescribed. Grassy woodland and wet forest communities had greater
   species richness and a lower standing crop than dry forest communities.
   Species richness and standing crop was greater in winter than in summer.
   Overall, species from the family Russulaceae, and the genera Dermocybe,
   Descomyces, and Hysterangium were dominant. Community composition varied
   among forest types and each forest type exhibited a suite of unique and
   common species, although much variation was unexplained. Variation in
   community structure was associated with some habitat attributes; at
   Mount Kaputar, woody plant species richness, canopy cover, litter depth,
   soil phosphorous, and elevation helped explain the sporocarp communities
   of different forest types, while at New England, woody plant species
   richness, rainfall, topographic aspect, soil texture, and soil nitrogen
   helped explain communities. This work contributes to knowledge of
   truffle-like fungal diversity, the factors affecting sporocarp
   distribution across landscapes, and the availability of sporocarps as a
   food resource for mycophagous mammals. Greater understanding of fungal
   diversity and mammal-fungal interactions also has important implications

Abstract = {{Wildfires are a pervasive disturbance in boreal forests, and the
   frequency and intensity of boreal wildfires is expected to increase with
   climate warming. Boreal forests store a large fraction of global soil
   organic carbon (C), but relatively few studies have documented how
   wildfires affect soil microbial communities and soil C dynamics. We used
   a fire chronosequence in upland boreal forests of interior Alaska with
   sites that were 1, 7, 12, 24, 55, 90, and 100 years post-fire to examine
   the short- and long-term responses of fungal community composition,
   fungal abundance, extracellular enzyme activity, and litter
   decomposition to wildfires. We hypothesized that post-fire changes in
   fungal abundance and community composition would constrain decomposition
   following fires. We found that wildfires altered the composition of soil
   fungal communities. The relative abundance of ascomycetes significantly
   increased following fire whereas basidiomycetes decreased. Post-fire
   decreases in basidiomycete fungi were likely attributable to declines in
   ectomycorrhizal fungi. Fungal hyphal lengths in the organic horizon
   significantly declined in response to wildfire, and they required at
   least 24 years to return to pre-fire levels. Post-fire reductions in
   fungal hyphal length were associated with decreased activities of
   hydrolytic extracellular enzymes. In support of our hypothesis, the
   decomposition rate of aspen and black spruce litter significantly
   increased as forests recovered from fire. Our results indicate that
   post-fire reductions in soil fungal abundance and activity likely
   inhibit litter decomposition following boreal wildfires. Slower rates of
   litter decay may lead to decreased heterotrophic respiration from soil
   following fires and contribute to a negative feedback to climate
   warming.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive species may leave behind legacies that persist even after
   removal, inhibiting subsequent restoration efforts. We examined the soil
   legacy of Cytisus scoparius, a nitrogen-fixing, putatively allelopathic
   shrub invading the western US. We tested the hypothesis that allelopathy
   plays a critical role in the depressive effect of Cytisus on the key
   native Douglas-fir, both directly on tree growth and indirectly via
   effects on its ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF). In a greenhouse factorial
   experiment, we used activated carbon to inhibit Cytisus-produced
   allelochemicals and sucrose to reduce elevated nitrogen (N). We found
   that: (1) Cytisus-invaded soils depressed Douglas-fir growth compared to
   uninvaded forest soils. The effect of adding Cytisus litter was positive
   (possibly reflecting an N fertilization effect) only in the presence of
   activated carbon, providing evidence for a role of allelopathic
   compounds. Activated carbon did not increase growth in the absence of
   Cytisus litter. Finally, sucrose addition provided weak support for a
   nitrogen effect of Cytisus litter. (2) Seedlings grown in Cytisus soils
   had lower EMF abundance compared to those in uninvaded forest soils. In
   forest soil from one site, adding Cytisus litter also decreased EMF
   abundance. Douglas-fir growth increased significantly with EMF across
   sites and soils suggesting that changes in EMF were linked to tree
   growth. The fungal taxon Cenococcum geophilum was significantly
   depressed in Cytisus soils compared to forest soils, while Rhizopogon
   rogersii abundance was similar across soil types. These results together
   suggest an overall negative effect of Cytisus on the growth of a
   dominant native tree and its fungal symbionts. Our study suggests how
   the role of allelopathy in ecological restoration may play out on two
   time scales: through immediate, direct impacts on native plants as well
   as through long-term, persistent impacts mediated by the collapse or
   transformation of microbial communities.}},

Abstract = {{We compiled quantitative estimates on symbiotic N-2 fixation by trees in
   agroforestry systems (AFS) in order to evaluate the critical
   environmental and management factors that affect the benefit from N-2
   fixation to system N economy. The so-called ``N-2-fixing tree{''} is a
   tripartite symbiotic system composed of the plant, N-2-fixing bacteria,
   and mycorrhizae-forming fungi. Almost 100 recognised rhizobial species
   associated with legumes do not form an evolutionary homologous clade and
   are functionally diverse. The global bacterial diversity is still
   unknown. Actinorrhizal symbioses in AFS remain almost unstudied.
   Dinitrogen fixation in AFS should be quantified using N isotopic methods
   or long-term system N balances. The general average +/- A standard
   deviation of tree dependency on N-2 fixation (\%Ndfa) in 38 cases using
   N isotopic analyses was 59 +/- A 16.6 \%. Under humid and sub-humid
   conditions, the percentage was higher in young (69 +/- A 10.7 \%) and
   periodically pruned trees (63 +/- A 11.8 \%) than in free-growing trees
   (54 +/- A 11.7 \%). High variability was observed in drylands (range
   10-84 \%) indicating need for careful species and provenance selection
   in these areas. Annual N-2 fixation was the highest in improved fallow
   and protein bank systems, 300-650 kg {[}N] ha(-1). General average for
   16 very variable AFS was 246 kg {[}N] ha(-1), which is enough for
   fulfilling crop N needs for sustained or increasing yield in low-input
   agriculture and reducing N-fertiliser use in large-scale agribusiness.
   Leaf litter and green mulch applications release N slowly to the soil
   and mostly benefit the crop through long-term soil improvement. Root and
   nodule turnover and N rhizodeposition from N-2-fixing trees are sources
   of easily available N for the crop yet they have been largely ignored in
   agroforestry research. There is also increasing evidence on direct N
   transfer from N-2-fixing trees to crops, e.g. via common mycelial
   networks of mycorrhizal fungi or absorption of tree root exudates by the
   crop. Research on the below-ground tree-crop-microbia interactions is
   needed for fully understanding and managing N-2 fixation in AFS.}},

   composition among the horizons, proportions of glutamine generally
   increased with depth and were generally greater in the mineral horizons
   than in the BOHs, suggesting root exudation or fine root turnover as an
   amino acid source. In both successional stages, amino acid
   concentrations were nearly always highest in the Oe/Oa horizon and
   rapidly decreased with depth. BOHs generally had greater amino acid
   concentrations than the surrounding mineral horizons in both
   successional stages, but amino acid concentrations in successive BOHs
   declined with depth in the soil profile, suggesting that although BOHs
   do remain as biological hot spots and potential nutrient reservoirs as
   far down as 60 cm depth, their importance declines over time. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Mushroom fruiting, the reproduction of fungi, has broad implications for
   forest health, terrestrial biomass turnover, and global carbon cycle.
   However, little is known about the difference in phenology and
   environmental drivers of mushroom fruiting between functional guilds,
   e.g., ectomycorrhizal (ECM) mutualists and saprotrophs (SAP). There is a
   remarkable difference between ECM and SAP fungi in their available
   carbon sources and lifecycles, and thus these fungal groups are likely
   to differ in fruiting phenology. We analyzed intra-and inter-annual
   phenological patterns of mushroom fruiting throughout the year using a
   long-term census dataset of mushroom-forming fungi in a Japanese oak
   forest in which a total of 11,923 mushroom counts (668 species) were
   recorded during monthly intervals from 1982 to 2011. ECM fungi showed a
   unimodal seasonal fruiting peak from mid-summer to early autumn;
   litter-decomposing fungi showed moderate fruiting peaks from early
   summer or early autumn, and the phenology of wood-decomposing fungi
   varied considerably among the genera. Each functional group was
   controlled by a different set of external factors; temperature and
   rainfall increased ECM fungal fruiting, but key factors substantially
   differed among the genera of litter-and wood-decomposing fungi in
   taxon-specific ways. Our results suggest that fungal fruiting phenology
   may be affected by the seasonality of carbohydrate availability. The
   highly scheduled reproduction of ECM fungi may reflect
   temperature-dependent increases and drought-induced decreases of
   photosynthetic activity in host plants rather than improved growth
   conditions for fungi during the summer. We argue that the way a fungus
   obtains carbohydrates may explain a substantial fraction of the fruiting
   phenology, which may make a differential contribution to the community
   structure of fungus-associated organisms and terrestrial biomass
   turnover based on fungal functional groups.}},

Abstract = {{In many ecosystems, browsing of large mammals can affect plant species
   compositions. However, much less is known about potential above- and

   focused on the direct and indirect effects of browsing on trophic and

   below-ground cascade effects, white-tailed deer have been excluded for
   over 18 years from three 4-ha plots, which were paired with same sized
   deer access plots. Our results demonstrate complex direct and indirect
   cascade effects on forest food webs. Deer exclusion directly altered
   woody species composition and significantly increased shrub and sapling
   density. Above-ground cascade effects include greater leaf litter
   accumulation and higher arthropod density and biomass within the
   exclosures. Below-ground indirect effects include significant decrease
   in soil nutrients, and higher arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculum
   potential in the exclosures. Because ecosystems have finite resource
   availability, high deer density may imbalance the system by redirecting
   resources toward maintaining deer biomass at the expense of multiple
   trophic levels throughout the forest community. Both complex bottom up

Abstract = {{Disturbance is an important factor in changing ecological processes.
   Forested ecosystems undergo natural disturbances of fire and windthrow
   and disturbances involved in management (thinning, harvesting, control
   burning). Using the New Jersey pine barrens as model system for eastern
   US mixed forests, we have observed that under conditions of repeated
   physical soil disruption or,control burning, the pine barrens forest
   understory can change from ericaceous to graminoid species dominance
   through suppression of the ericaceous plants. In order to predict
   changes in soil properties and assess the potential to maintain this
   alternate herbaceous layer community, replicate manipulation plots were
   established the Franklin Parker Preserve in the New Jersey pine barrens.
   The manipulations consisted of: intact forest controls (CONT), canopy
   tree thinning (THIN) and canopy tree thinning plus ercicaceous stem
   removal and soil tilling (THIN \& PLOW). The manipulations were designed
   to increase sunlight penetration to the forest floor and to encourage
   graminoid plant species establishment. Soil active carbon, microbial
   biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), six
   hydrolytic enzyme activities and two oxidative enzyme activities under
   three different treatments were measured. In the 0-10 cm soil depth, we
   observed that protease and arylsulfatase activity showed a significant
   decrease in the THIN and THIN \& PLOW treatments compared to CONT, the
   activities of cellulase and phenol oxidase were significantly lower in
   THIN than CONT and THIN \& PLOW, whereas the trend of peroxidase
   activity was opposite. There were no significant differences between
   treatments for glucosaminase, glucosidase and acid phosphatase
   activities. For the 10-20 cm soil depth only acid phosphatase and phenol
   oxidase activity significantly differed between treatments. We found
   that all enzyme activities except for peroxidase were significantly
   lower in the 10-20 cm soil horizon than in the 0-10 cm; peroxidase
   activity was significantly higher in the lower soil horizon. We
   demonstrated the activities of cellulase, phenoloxidase, arylsulfatase
   and protease were significantly and positively related to active C, but
   peroxidase activity was negatively correlated. Less expected is that
   only phenol oxidase was related to soil MBC, whereas the correlations
   between peroxidase, phenol oxidase, arysulfatase, protease activities
   and soil MBN were obvious. By understanding the relationships between
   microbial activity (enzyme production) and disturbance, we can determine
   the beneficial effects of many management practices on the potential
   nutrient availability for subsequent tree growth, since these enzymes
   are key to nutrient mineralization and carbon dynamics in soil. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The availability of phosphorus (P) can limit net primary production

   Although it is well known that plant roots release organic acids to

   Study sites were located in two tropical montane rainforests (a
   P-deficient older soil and a P-rich younger soil) and a tropical lowland
   rainforest on Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo to analyze environmental control of
   organic acid exudation with respect to soil P availability, tree genus,
   and NPP. We quantified root exudation of oxalic, citric, and malic acids
   using in situ methods in which live fine roots were placed in syringes
   containing nutrient solution. Exudation rates of organic acids were
   greatest in the P-deficient soil in the tropical montane rainforest. The
   carbon (C) fluxes of organic acid exudation in the P-deficient soil (0.7
   mol C m(-2) month(-1)) represented 16.6\% of the aboveground NPP, which
   was greater than those in the P-rich soil (3.1\%) and in the lowland
   rainforest (4.7\%), which exhibited higher NPP. The exudation rates of
   organic acids increased with increasing root surface area and tip
   number. A shift in vegetation composition toward dominance by tree
   species exhibiting a larger root surface area might contribute to the
   higher organic acid exudation observed in P-deficient soil. Our results
   quantitatively showed that tree roots can release greater quantities of
   organic acids in response to P deficiency in tropical rainforests.}},

Abstract = {{Fungi are important members of soil microbial communities with a crucial

   highly diverse, little is known about factors influencing variations in
   their diversity and community structure among forests dominated by the

   composition of managed and unmanaged European beech dominated forests
   located in three German regions, the Schwa ``bische Alb in Southwestern,
   the Hainich-Dun in Central and the Schorfheide Chorin in the
   Northeastern Germany, using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA
   pyrotag sequencing. Multiple sequence quality filtering followed by
   sequence data normalization revealed 1655 fungal operational taxonomic
   units. Further analysis based on 722 abundant fungal OTUs revealed the
   phylum Basidiomycota to be dominant (54\%) and its community to comprise
   71.4\% of ectomycorrhizal taxa. Fungal community structure differed
   significantly (p <= 0.001) among the three regions and was characterized
   by non-random fungal OTUs co-occurrence. Soil parameters, herbaceous
   understory vegetation, and litter cover affected fungal community
   structure. However, within each study region we found no difference in
   fungal community structure between management types. Our results also
   showed region specific significant correlation patterns between the

Abstract = {{Amino sugars in fungal cell walls (such as chitin) represent an
   important source of nitrogen (N) in many forest soil ecosystems. Despite
   the importance of this material in soil nitrogen cycling, comparatively
   little is known about abiotic and biotic controls on and the timescale
   of its turnover. Part of the reason for this lack of information is the
   inaccessibility of these materials to classic bulk extraction methods.
   To address this issue, we used advanced visualization tools to examine
   transformation pathways of chitin-rich fungal cell wall residues as they
   interact with microorganisms, soil organic matter and mineral surfaces.
   lOur goal was to document initial micro-scale dynamics of the
   incorporation of C-13- and N-15-labeled chitin into fungi-dominated
   microenvironments in O-horizons of old-growth forest soils. At the end
   of a 3-week incubation experiment, high-resolution secondary ion mass
   spectrometry imaging of hyphae-associated soil microstructures revealed
   a preferential association of N-15 with Fe-rich particles.
   Synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray spectromicroscopy
   (STXM/NEXA-FS) of the same samples showed that thin organic coatings on
   these soil microstructures are enriched in aliphatic C and amide N on Fe
   (hydr) oxides, suggesting a concentration of microbial lipids and
   proteins on these surfaces. A possible explanation for the results of
   our micro-scale investigation of chemical and spatial patterns is that
   amide N from chitinous fungal cell walls was assimilated by
   hyphae-associated bacteria, resynthesized into proteinaceous amide N,
   and subsequently concentrated onto Fe (hydr) oxide surfaces. If
   confirmed in other soil ecosystems, such rapid association of microbial
   N with hydroxylated Fe oxide surfaces may have important implications
   for mechanistic models of microbial cycling of C and N. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Synergistic effects on decomposition in litter mixtures have been
   suggested to be due to the transfer of nitrogen from N-rich to N-poor
   species. However, the dominant pathway and the underlying mechanisms
   remain to be elucidated. We conducted an experiment to investigate and
   quantify the control mechanisms for nitrogen transfer between two litter
   species of contrasting nitrogen status (15N labeled and unlabeled Fagus
   sylvatica and Fraxinus excelsior) in presence and absence of
   micro-arthropods. We found that 15N was predominantly transferred
   actively aboveground by saprotrophic fungi, rather than belowground or
   passively by leaching. However, litter decomposition remained unaffected
   by N-dynamics and was poorly affected by micro-arthropods, suggesting
   that synergistic effects in litter mixtures depend on complex
   environmental interrelationships. Remarkably, more 15N was transferred
   from N-poor beech than N-rich ash litter. Moreover, the low transfer of
   15N from ash litter was insensitive to destination species whereas the
   transfer of 15N from labeled beech litter to unlabeled beech was
   significantly greater than the amount of 15N transferred to unlabeled
   ash suggesting that processes of nitrogen transfer fundamentally differ
   between litter species of different nitrogen status. Microbial analyses
   suggest that nitrogen of N-rich litter is entirely controlled by
   bacteria that hamper nitrogen capture of microbes in the environment
   supporting the source-theory. In contrast, nitrogen of N-poor fungal
   dominated litter is less protected and transferable depending on the
   nitrogen status and the transfer capacity of the microbial community of
   the co-occurring litter species supporting the gradient-theory. Thus,
   our results challenge the traditional view regarding the role of N-rich
   litter in decomposing litter mixtures. We rather suggest that N-rich
   litter is only a poor nitrogen source, whereas N-poor litter, can act as
   an important nitrogen source in litter mixtures. Consequently both
   absolute and relative differences in initial litter C/N ratios of
   co-occurring litter species need to be considered for understanding
   nitrogen dynamics in decomposing litter mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrophilous macrofungi (PM) are a narrowly specialised group appearing
   exclusively in plant communities recently destroyed by fire. Their
   significance has hitherto been studied only for vegetation destroyed
   over large areas, while in small areas of fire, i.e., microhabitats they
   are viewed as independent components of the community linked only to the
   substratum. In the present work, the following hypotheses were tested:
   (1) species structures of PM in microhabitats depend on the type of
   plant community, (2) PM form communities on a small scale which are
   similar in structure and function to analogous large scale communities.
   We studied 20 surfaces destroyed by illegal campfires in four natural
   plant communities: oak-hornbeam forest Tilio-Carpinetum (TC), lowland
   acidophilus beech forest Luzulo pilosae-Fagetum (LF), suboceanic pine
   forest Leucobryo-Pinetum (LP), and an initial-phase xerothermic
   grassland community on a transitional habitat (MH). TC and LF habitats
   were conspicuously more favourable for PM than LP and MH. In TC and LF
   fire leads to significant loss of mycorrhizae in the upper layer of leaf
   litter. This provides a development opportunity for ectomycorrhizal PM
   species which, having little competition, substitute for the destroyed
   fragments of mycorrhizal networks. In LP and MH fire over a small
   surface does not destroy more deeply located mycorrhizal associations.
   Another important factor for PM influencing the quality of environment
   is the fertility of soil: highest in TC, intermediate in LF and lowest
   in LP and MH. The results casts doubt on the concept that PM are only
   synusia linked to the substratum (burnt wood). PM growing in
   microhabitats constitute an important group of organisms which
   facilitate rapid regeneration of plant community fragments destroyed by

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in removing greater amounts of non-timber
   residues from forests for use in energy production. As part of a study
   aimed at elucidating the ecological impacts of these practices in
   Finland, piles of thinning residues of contrasting mass per unit area
   were established in 2004 around the base of individual Scots pine trees.
   As part of an NSF funded undergraduate training program, we have sampled
   the soil under these residue piles to evaluate the effect of leaving
   different amounts of residue on site to supply nutrients for remaining
   trees. Aboveground tree biomass production was significantly higher with
   higher levels of post-harvest residue retention. However, changes in
   soil chemistry were minimal and inconsistent with increasing residue
   amounts. Fine (<1 mm) tree root biomass showed little response to
   residue levels, but specific root length (length per unit mass) and
   ectomycorrhizal root tip abundance showed significant increases in the
   highest residue addition compared to the no-addition control. This may
   suggest a greater root searching strategy under high residue levels.
   There was no evidence of residue effect on soil nematodes but a
   consistent increase in abundance of 0-2 mm length enchytraeids with
   increased residue. This may be a result of higher rates of asexual
   reproduction under residues. Soil arthropod abundances did not correlate
   with residue levels. Even in this cold boreal forest ecosystem, it is
   possible that sampling 5 years after residue placement we may have
   missed some of the early influence of decomposition of more labile
   fractions of the residues on soil organisms and processes. It is likely
   that the current phase of woody material decomposition will have lesser
   effects on soil biology. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A common finding in multiple CO2 enrichment experiments in forests is
   the lack of soil carbon (C) accumulation owing to microbial priming of
   old soil organic matter (SOM). However, soil C losses may also result
   from the accelerated turnover of young microbial tissues that are rich
   in nitrogen (N) relative to bulk SOM. We measured root-induced changes
   in soil C dynamics in a pine forest exposed to elevated CO2 and N
   enrichment by combining stable isotope analyses, molecular
   characterisations of SOM and microbial assays. We find strong evidence
   that the accelerated turnover of root-derived C under elevated CO2 is
   sufficient in magnitude to offset increased belowground inputs. In
   addition, the C losses were associated with accelerated N cycling,
   suggesting that trees exposed to elevated CO2 not only enhance N
   availability by stimulating microbial decomposition of SOM via priming
   but also increase the rate at which N cycles through microbial pools.}},

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi obtain both mineral and simple organic
   nutrients from soil and transport these to plant roots. Natural
   abundance of stable isotopes (15N and 13C) in fruit bodies and potential
   enzymatic activities of ECM root tips provide insights into mineral
   nutrition of these mutualistic partners. By combining rDNA sequence
   analysis with enzymatic and stable isotope assays of root tips, we
   hypothesized that phylogenetic affinities of ECM fungi are more
   important than ECM exploration type, soil horizon and host plant in
   explaining the differences in mineral nutrition of trees in an African
   lowland rainforest. Ectomycorrhizal fungal species belonging to
   extraradical mycelium-rich morphotypes generally displayed the strongest
   potential activities of degradation enzymes, except for laccase. The
   signature of 15N was determined by the ECM fungal lineage, but not by
   the exploration type. Potential enzymatic activities of root tips were
   unrelated to 15N signature of ECM root tip. The lack of correlation
   suggests that these methods address different aspects in plant nutrient
   uptake. Stable isotope analysis of root tips could provide an additional
   indirect assessment of fungal and plant nutrition that enables
   enhancement of taxonomic coverage and control for soil depth and

Abstract = {{Bryophytes are a dominant vegetation component of the boreal forest, but
   little is known about their associated fungal communities, including

   and composition of fungal communities associated with three widespread
   boreal bryophytes was investigated using HPLC assays of ergosterol and
   amplicon pyrosequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)
   region of rDNA. The bryophyte phyllosphere community was dominated by
   Ascomycota. Fungal biomass did not decline appreciably in winter (P =
   0.272). Significant host-specific patterns in seasonal variation of
   biomass were detected (P = 0.003). Although seasonal effects were not
   the primary factors structuring community composition, collection date
   significantly explained (P = 0.001) variation not attributed to
   locality, host, and tissue. Community homogenization and a reduction in
   turnover occurred with the onset of frost events and subzero air and
   soil temperatures. Fluctuations in the relative abundance of particular
   fungal groups seem to reflect the nature of their association with
   mosses, although conclusions are drawn with caution because of potential
   methodological bias. The moss-associated fungal community is dynamic,

Abstract = {{Deadwood-associated insects and saprotrophic fungi are principal agents
   of wood decomposition in boreal forest. Silvicultural treatments that
   alter microclimate and availability of deadwood likely affect
   composition and growth rates of both insect and fungal communities,
   leading to changes in wood decomposition rates. Here, we relate both
   saproxylic beetle and dominant polypore assemblages with woody
   decomposition rates and environmental variables in experimental partial
   cuts, clearcuts, and uncut controls using a series of causal models to
   determine the relationship between stand structure, bio-diversity, and
   ecosystem function in black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) forests.
   Overall beetle and fungal composition differed between uncut stands and
   harvested stands. Main effects of harvesting included large increases in
   wood-feeding beetles and the fungus Gloeophyllum sepiarium (Wul.: Fr.)
   Karst. We suggest that these species were promoted by specific
   alterations in microhabitat conditions of deadwood. Within clearcuts
   specifically, changes in species composition and significantly more
   fungal degree-days resulted in significantly higher decomposition rates.
   We concluded that levels of partial cutting in the range of 15\%-20\%

Abstract = {{1.Soil food webs are compartmentalized and comprise major energy
   channels, such as the plant litter, fungal and bacterial channel.
   However, the relative contribution of basal resources to these channels

   took advantage of the Swiss Canopy Crane Project, where a mature
   temperate forest was labelled with 13C-depleted CO2. By exchanging leaf
   litter between the 13CO2-enriched area and an unlabelled control area,
   we were able to separate carbon fluxes originating from leaf litter and
   roots, respectively. 3.Fatty acid (FA) composition and d13C signatures
   of individual FAs of basal resources and soil animals, including
   decomposers and predators, were analysed. Marker FAs allowed
   differentiation of the contribution of plant litter, fungi and bacteria
   to the nutrition of higher trophic levels. 4.Our findings suggest that
   root-derived carbon is of major importance for the soil animal food web
   and that it enters the soil animal food web mainly via feeding on
   ectomycorrhizal fungi. 5.In contrast to previous studies that emphasized
   the dominance of the fungal energy channel, significant amounts of
   bacterial FAs in each of the predator species studied indicate that the
   bacterial energy channel is considerably more important for the
   nutrition of higher trophic levels than previously assumed. The flux of
   energy along the two channels presumably contributes to food web
   stability. 6.Compound-specific 13(CO2) FA analysis of basal resources
   and soil animals allowed the separation of energy fluxes originating
   from ectomycorrhizal vs. saprotrophic fungi, from bacteria feeding on
   leaf litter vs. bacteria feeding on root exudates, and from leaf litter
   itself, providing information on the partitioning of these different

Abstract = {{Gradient analysis is rarely used in studies of fungal communities. Data

   montane cloud forest, conifer forest, and their ecotones. From May to
   October 2010, macromycetes were collected monthly within ten 10 x 10 m
   permanent plots per site. In total, 672 individuals of 213 species of
   macromycetes were recorded. Models for richness and diversity for all
   macromycete and ectomycorrhizal communities displayed peaks in the
   mid-part of the gradient, and a tendency to increase with elevation,
   whereas xylophagous fungi displayed a peak in the mid-lower part but
   tended to decrease with elevation. Cluster and Maximum Likelihood
   analyses distinguished four communities for both macromycetes and trees,

   correspondence analysis indicated that macromycete distribution along
   the gradient is related to slope, relative humidity, soil temperature,
   soil water content, canopy openness, and litter depth. Spearman's
   correlation and regression trees suggested that air and soil
   temperature, relative humidity, soil water content, canopy openness,
   vegetation structure and tree species richness were most strongly
   related to macrofungal functional groups, but these environmental
   variables were often correlated to the forest type and may not be

Abstract = {{Microbial symbioses have evolved repeatedly across the tree of life, but

   with this transition are the losses of two cellulase genes, each of
   which plays a critical role in extracellular decomposition of organic
   matter. However a third gene, which acts at later stages in cellulose
   decomposition, is retained by many, but not all, ectomycorrhizal
   species. Experiments confirm that symbiotic Amanita species have lost
   the ability to grow on complex organic matter and have therefore lost
   the capacity to live in forest soils without carbon supplied by a host

   key roles in the evolutionary stability of these ubiquitous mutualisms.}},

Abstract = {{Fungal colonization of litter has been described mostly in terms of
   fructification succession in the decomposition process or the process of
   fungal ligninolysis. No studies have been conducted on litter
   colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and their
   relationship with the presence of saprotrophic fungi. The aim of the
   present study was to evaluate the relationships that exist in
   simultaneous leaf litter colonization by AMF and saprotrophic fungi and
   the relationships between rates of litter and associated root
   colonization by AMF at different soil depths. We selected Eugenia sp.
   and Syzygium sp. in a riparian tropical forest, with an abundant
   production of litter (O horizon), we evaluated litter and root
   colonization at different depths, its C:N ratios, and the edaphic
   physico-chemical parameters of the A horizon immediately below the
   litter layer. Litter colonization by saprotrophic fungi and AMF
   increased with depth, but the saprotrophic fungal colonization of some
   litter fragments decreased in the lowermost level of the litter while
   AMF litter colonization continued to increase. Plant roots were present
   only in the middle and bottom layers, but their mycorrhizal colonization
   did not correlate with litter colonization. The external hyphae length
   of AMF is abundant (ca. 20 m g(-1) sample) and, in common with sample
   humidity, remained constant with increasing depth. We conclude that in
   zones of riparian tropical forest with abundant sufficient litter
   accumulation and abundant AMF external hyphae,, the increase in litter
   colonization by AMF with depth correlates to the colonization by
   saprotrophic fungi, but their presence in the deepest layers is
   independent of both litter colonization by saprotrophic fungi and root
   colonization by AMF. (C) 2012 The British Mycological Society. Published

Abstract = {{Fungi in the Agaricomycetes (Basidiomycota) are the primary decomposers
   in temperate forests of dead wood on and in the forest soil. Through the
   use of isolation techniques selective for saprotrophic Agaricomycetes, a
   variety of wood decay fungi were isolated from a northern hardwood stand
   in the Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. In particular,
   Hypholoma lateritium (Schaeff.: Fr.) P. Kumm. was isolated from
   basidiocarps, decaying Acer rubrum L. logs, the Oe organic soil horizon,
   and the E and BC mineral soil horizons. Identification was confirmed by
   sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region of nuclear
   ribosomal DNA. All isolates had identical sequences in this region to
   previously published sequences for the species; some were monokaryotic
   and simple-septate and others were dikaryotic, with clamp connections.
   Isolates were further characterized by banding patterns (DNA
   fingerprints) produced with PCR primers based in simple repetitive
   sequences and the minisatellite M13. Nine dikaryotic isolates from
   basidiocarps and from soil horizons Oe, E, and BC had identical
   fingerprint patterns with all primers tested. The confirmed presence of
   H. lateritium suggests that this fungus could form a mycelial
   translocation network that bridges mineral and organic soil horizons and
   decaying logs.}},

Abstract = {{This study utilized individual senesced sugar maple and beech leaves as
   natural sampling units within which to quantify saprotrophic fungal
   diversity. Quantifying communities in individual leaves allowed us to
   determine if fungi display a classic taxaarea relationship (species
   richness increasing with area). We found a significant taxaarea
   relationship for sugar maple leaves, but not beech leaves, consistent
   with Wright's species-energy theory. This suggests that energy
   availability as affected plant biochemistry is a key factor regulating
   the scaling relationships of fungal diversity. We also compared taxa
   rank abundance distributions to models associated with niche or neutral
   theories of community assembly, and tested the influence of leaf type as
   an environmental niche factor controlling fungal community composition.
   Among rank abundance distribution models, the zero-sum model derived
   from neutral theory showed the best fit to our data. Leaf type explained
   only 5\% of the variability in community composition. Habitat (vernal
   pool, upland or riparian forest floor) and site of collection explained
   > 40\%, but could be attributed to either niche or neutral processes.
   Hence, although niche dynamics may regulate fungal communities at the
   habitat scale, our evidence points towards neutral assembly of
   saprotrophic fungi on individual leaves, with energy availability
   constraining the taxaarea relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Evergreen and deciduous plants are widely expected to have different
   impacts on soil nitrogen (N) availability because of differences in leaf
   litter chemistry and ensuing effects on net N mineralization (N-min). We
   evaluated this hypothesis by compiling published data on net N-min rates
   beneath co-occurring stands of evergreen and deciduous trees. The
   compiled data included 35 sets of co-occurring stands in temperate and
   boreal forests. Evergreen and deciduous stands did not have consistently
   divergent effects on net N-min rates; net N-min beneath deciduous trees
   was higher when comparing natural stands (19 contrasts), but equivalent
   to evergreens in plantations (16 contrasts). We also compared net N-min
   rates beneath pairs of co-occurring genera. Most pairs of genera did not
   differ consistently, i.e., tree species from one genus had higher net
   N-min at some sites and lower net N-min at other sites. Moreover,
   several common deciduous genera (Acer, Betula, Populus) and deciduous
   Quercus spp. did not typically have higher net N-min rates than common
   evergreen genera (Pinus, Picea). There are several reasons why tree
   effects on net N-min are poorly predicted by leaf habit and phylogeny.
   For example, the amount of N mineralized from decomposing leaves might
   be less than the amount of N mineralized from organic matter pools that
   are less affected by leaf litter traits, such as dead roots and soil
   organic matter. Also, effects of plant traits and plant groups on net
   N-min probably depend on site-specific factors such as stand age and
   soil type.}},

Abstract = {{Soils in boreal forests contain large stocks of carbon. Plants are the
   main source of this carbon through tissue residues and root exudates. A
   major part of the exudates are allocated to symbiotic ectomycorrhizal
   fungi. In return, the plant receives nutrients, in particular nitrogen
   from the mycorrhizal fungi. To capture the nitrogen, the fungi must at
   least partly disrupt the recalcitrant organic matterprotein complexes
   within which the nitrogen is embedded. This disruption process is poorly
   characterized. We used spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome
   profiling to examine the mechanism by which the ectomycorrhizal fungus
   Paxillus involutus degrades organic matter when acquiring nitrogen from
   plant litter. The fungus partially degraded polysaccharides and modified
   the structure of polyphenols. The observed chemical changes were
   consistent with a hydroxyl radical attack, involving Fenton chemistry
   similar to that of brown-rot fungi. The set of enzymes expressed by Pa.
   involutus during the degradation of the organic matter was similar to
   the set of enzymes involved in the oxidative degradation of wood by
   brown-rot fungi. However, Pa. involutus lacked transcripts encoding
   extracellular enzymes needed for metabolizing the released carbon. The
   saprotrophic activity has been reduced to a radical-based biodegradation
   system that can efficiently disrupt the organic matterprotein complexes
   and thereby mobilize the entrapped nutrients. We suggest that the
   released carbon then becomes available for further degradation and
   assimilation by commensal microbes, and that these activities have been
   lost in ectomycorrhizal fungi as an adaptation to symbiotic growth on
   host photosynthate. The interdependence of ectomycorrhizal symbionts and
   saprophytic microbes would provide a key link in the turnover of
   nutrients and carbon in forest ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the influence of above- and belowground factors on the soil
   microbial community in a Chinese subtropical forest, one of the most
   diverse biomes in the northern hemisphere. Soil samples were taken at
   different depths from four replicate comparative study plots in each of
   three forest age classes (young 10-40 years, medium 40-80 years, old >=
   80 years). Microbial biomass and community structure were then
   determined using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, and basal
   respiration and microbial biomass carbon (C-mic) were determined by
   substrate-induced respiration. These data were then related to plant
   community and soil variables using non-metric multidimensional scaling
   analysis and post-hoc permutational correlations. We found that
   microbial lipid composition and abundance were not related to forest age
   class. Instead, microbial lipid composition and abundance were related
   to factors reflecting primary production, i.e., percent litter cover,
   percent dead wood cover, and percent tree layer cover. Specifically, the
   relative abundance (mol fraction) of indicators for arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were
   positively significantly correlated with percent litter cover. We also
   found that the biomass of all microbial groups and total PLFA were
   negatively significantly related to percent deadwood cover. In addition,
   pH(H2O) was the only soil parameter that was correlated significantly to
   microbial biomass. Our results indicate that overarching ecological
   factors such as plant productivity and soil pH are important factors
   influencing the soil microbial community, both in terms of biomass and

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal mycelial necromass is an important source of carbon for
   free-living microorganisms in forest soils, yet we know little either of
   its fate when it enters soil or of the identity of microbes that are
   able to utilise mycelium as their energy source. Here we used
   C-13-labelled mycelium of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus
   microcarpus in laboratory incubations in combination with DNA-stable
   isotope probing (SIP) to determine the identity of functionally active
   soil fungi that can utilise dead mycelium. We also used solid-state
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to detect parallel changes
   in the abundance of key biochemical constituents of soil. A decrease in
   bulk soil C-13 concentration together with rapid loss of glycogen and
   chitin-glucan during the 4 week incubations suggested that dead mycelium
   was rapidly turned over. Further, C-13 was incorporated into fungal DNA
   within 7 days of addition to soil. DNA-SIP also revealed a dynamic
   community of functionally active soil fungi. By applying DNA-SIP and NMR
   in parallel, our data show that carbon from decaying ectomycorrhizal
   mycelium is rapidly transformed and incorporated into free-living soil
   fungi. This finding emphasises that dead extramatrical mycelium is an
   important source of labile carbon for soil microorganisms. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Plant diversity is considered one factor structuring soil fungal
   communities because the diversity of compounds in leaf litter might
   determine the extent of resource heterogeneity for decomposer
   communities. Lowland tropical rain forests have the highest plant
   diversity per area of any biome. Since fungi are responsible for much of
   the decomposition occurring in forest soils, understanding the factors
   that structure fungi in tropical forests may provide valuable insight
   for predicting changes in global carbon and nitrogen fluxes. To test the
   role of plant diversity in shaping fungal community structure and
   function, soil (0-20 cm) and leaf litter (O horizons) were collected
   from six established 1-ha forest census plots across a natural plant
   diversity gradient on the Isthmus of Panama. We used 454 pyrosequencing
   and phospholipid fatty acid analysis to evaluate correlations between
   microbial community composition, precipitation, soil nutrients, and
   plant richness. In soil, the number of fungal taxa increased
   significantly with increasing mean annual precipitation, but not with
   plant richness. There were no correlations between fungal communities in
   leaf litter and plant diversity or precipitation, and fungal communities
   were found to be compositionally distinct between soil and leaf litter.
   To directly test for effects of plant species richness on fungal
   diversity and function, we experimentally re-created litter diversity
   gradients in litter bags with 1, 25, and 50 species of litter. After 6
   months, we found a significant effect of litter diversity on
   decomposition rate between one and 25 species of leaf litter. However,
   fungal richness did not track plant species richness. Although studies
   in a broader range of sites is required, these results suggest that
   precipitation may be a more important factor than plant diversity or
   soil nutrient status in structuring tropical forest soil fungal
   communities.}},

   P-fertilized plots at two elevations in an N-saturated Mediterranean-fir
   (Abies pinsapo) forest in southern Spain which shows P limitation
   symptoms. Root-exclusion was applied to identify the relative
   contributions of roots (plus mycorrhizal fungi) uptake, and
   heterotrophic immobilization by free-living microbes, to N retention.
   Overall N-15 recovery from the litter, 0-15-cm soil and root-uptake
   components was ca. 35\% higher in P-fertilized than in non-fertilized
   plots at both elevations. In non-fertilized plots, soil was the biggest

   ability of tree roots for soil N resulting in equal importance of the
   autotrophic (roots plus associated mycorhizal fungi) and heterotrophic
   (free-living microbes) components with respect to total N-15 recovery in

   fertilization, root-exclusion and isotope labelling we have demonstrated
   that reduced N retention capacity and dominance of soil microbial over

Abstract = {{Isotopes of nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) in
   ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi contain important information
   about ecological functioning, but the complexity of physiological and
   ecosystem processes contributing to fungal carbon and nitrogen dynamics
   has limited our ability to explain differences across taxa. Here, we
   measured delta N-15 and delta C-13 in needles, litter, soil, wood,
   fungal caps, and fungal stipes at numerous forested sites in Oregon, USA
   to determine how functional attributes and biochemical processes may
   influence isotopic values. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were classified by
   hydrophobicity of ectomycorrhizae and by patterns of hyphal exploration:
   saprotrophic fungi were classified into wood decay and litter decay
   fungi. For delta N-15, caps of hydrophobic taxa averaged 8.6 parts per
   thousand, hydrophilic taxa 3.2 parts per thousand and saprotrophic taxa
   0.5 parts per thousand, whereas needles averaged 3 parts per thousand
   and soil at 5-12 cm averaged 2 parts per thousand. Caps were higher in
   delta N-15, delta C-13, \%N, and \%C than stipes by 1.7 parts per
   thousand, 0.6 parts per thousand 1.75\%, and 2.61\%, respectively,
   presumably because of greater protein content in caps than stipes.
   Isotopic enrichment of caps relative to stipes was greater in
   hydrophobic taxa (3.1 parts per thousand for N-15 and 0.8 parts per
   thousand, for C-13) than in hydrophilic taxa (1.1 parts per thousand for
   N-15 and 0.5 parts per thousand for C-13). In multiple regressions, 45\%
   of variance in delta N-15(cap-stipe) and 30\% of variance in delta
   C-13(cap-stipe) was accounted for by various elemental, isotopic, and
   categorical variables. We estimated that fungal protein was enriched in
   N-15 relative to fungal chitin by 15 parts per thousand in hydrophobic
   taxa and by 7 parts per thousand in hydrophilic taxa. Fungal protein was
   enriched in C-13 by 4.2 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand relative to
   carbohydrates. Isotopic signatures of sources and isotopic fractionation
   during metabolic processing influence both isotopic patterns of
   sporocarps and the isotopic partitioning between caps and stipes;
   functional groups differed in processing of both nitrogen isotopes and

Abstract = {{A more detailed mechanistic understanding of how low molecular weight
   (MW) carbon (C) substrates are mineralized within the rhizosphere by
   soil microbial communities is crucial to accurately model terrestrial C
   fluxes. Currently, most experiments regarding soil C dynamics are
   conducted ex-situ (laboratory) and can fail to account for key variables
   (e.g. temperature and soil water content) which vary in-situ. In
   addition, ex-situ experiments are often highly invasive, e.g. severing
   root and mycorrhizal networks, changing the input and concentrations of
   low MW exudates within soil. The aim of this study was to directly
   compare the mineralization rates of 31 common low MW C substrates under
   ex- and in-situ conditions. In addition, we also assessed the
   inter-annual field variability of substrate mineralization rates. We
   added trace concentrations of 31 individual C-14-labelled common low MW
   C substrates into the top soil of an agricultural grassland and
   monitored the mineralization rates by capturing (CO2)-C-14 evolved from
   the soil over 7 d. Our results showed that the contribution of low MW C
   components to soil respiration was highly reproducible between parallel
   studies performed either in-situ or ex-situ. We also found that
   differences in the mineralization of individual compounds were more
   variable inter-annually in the field than between the laboratory and the
   field. Our results suggest that laboratory-based C mineralization data
   can be used to reliably parameterize C models but that multiple

Abstract = {{The effects of biodiversity of aboveground organisms have been widely
   investigated in a range of ecosystems, yet whether similar responses are
   also seen in belowground microbial communities, such as ectomycorrhizal
   (EM) fungi, are little understood. We investigated, in vitro, the
   effects of a gradient of 1-8 species of EM fungi interacting with
   substratum carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio on biomass production and CO2
   efflux. The model experimental systems enabled us to recover and measure
   biomass of individuals within communities and calculate net selection
   and complementarity effects. Both biomass and CO2 efflux increased with
   species richness particularly under high N concentrations. Moreover, net
   biodiversity effects were largely positive, driven by both selection and
   complementarity effects. Our results reveal, in pure culture, the
   implications of EM species richness on community productivity and C
   cycling, particularly under high N conditions, and constitute the basis
   for future experiments under natural conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {{Livestock production in Latin America has replaced tropical dry forests
   with conventional monocultures pastures (CP) that have degraded soils.
   As an alternative to CP, intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS) have been
   developed with multi-canopied vegetation that mimics native forest (F).
   The litter inputs and year-round presence of the tree rhizosphere in
   ISS, contribute to the formation of ``fertile islands,{''} which is
   expected to impact biological activity and crop productivity. This
   study, investigated the impact of the conversion of CP to ISS, as well
   as the effect of canopy of Prosopis juliflora trees in a chronosequence
   of ISS (3-15 years) on soil microbial communities and the
   physicochemical properties of soil. FAME (fatty acid methyl ester)
   profiles indicated that soil microbial community structure and
   composition shifted depending on land management systems. CP promoted
   the dominance of G(-) bacteria, while 155 chronosequence and F favored
   actinomycetes and fungal biomass (total and arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi). In addition, soil microbial community (FAME profiles) of ISS
   chronosequence and F were more similar than with CP. An increase in the
   Cy/pre FAME ratio in CP suggested that the microbial community was under
   higher stress. The advantage of including trees in pasture systems was
   reinforced by the observation that FAME biomarkers, enzymatic activities
   and nutrient status were significantly higher beneath the canopy of P.
   juliflora. The results indicate that ISS are viable alternatives for
   improving soil quality and metabolic function, which is reflected in the
   significant increase in microbial biomass, FAME biomarkers and enzyme
   activities compared with CP. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The functional groups of plants that characterize different phases of

   fine-root mass and root diameter increased with the succession, while
   root length, specific root length, root-hair length, root-hair
   incidence, AM colonization and AM spore density decreased. These results
   suggest that plant species from early stages of tropical succession with
   inherent rapid growth invest in fine roots and maintain a high degree of
   AM colonization in order to increase the capacity for nutrient

Abstract = {{Aims There is evidence that increased N inputs to boreal forests, via
   atmospheric deposition or intentional fertilization, may impact
   negatively on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi leading to a reduced flux of
   plant-derived carbon (C) back to the atmosphere via ECM. Our aim was to
   investigate the impact of N fertilization of a Pinus sylvestris (L.)
   forest stand on the return of recently photoassimilated C via the ECM
   component of soil respiration.
   Methods We used an in situ, large-scale, C-13-CO2 isotopic pulse
   labelling approach and monitored the C-13 label return using soil gas
   efflux chambers placed over three different types of soil collar to
   distinguish between heterotrophic (R-H), autotrophic (R-A; partitioned
   further into contributions from ECM hyphae and total R-A) and total
   (R-S) soil respiration.
   Results The impact of N fertilization was to significantly reduce R-A,
   particularly respiration via extramatrical ECM hyphae. ECM hyphal flux
   in control plots showed substantial spatial variability, resulting in
   mean flux estimates exceeding estimates of total R-A, while ECM
   contributions to R-A in N treated plots were estimated at around 30\%.
   Conclusion Significant impacts on soil C cycling may be caused by
   reduced plant C allocation to ECM fungi in response to increased N
   inputs to boreal forests; ecosystem models so far lack this detail.}},

Abstract = {{Although decomposer fungi have been recognized to play important roles
   in forest carbon and nutrient cycling as well as soil humus formation,
   their effects on forest dynamics, such as tree regeneration, are far
   less well understood than the effects of symbiotic and pathogenic fungi.
   In this study, I focused on tree regeneration on fallen woody debris,
   ``nurse logs{''}. I examined the effects of wood decomposer fungi on
   species composition and population densities of tree seedlings (height
   <50 cm) established on these logs. In an abandoned tract of coppice
   forest in Honshu. Japan, a thick litter layer had accumulated on the
   forest floor and seedlings of the small-seeded pioneer tree species
   Clethra barbinervis (Ericales) were found to be preferentially
   established on rotting fallen logs of the Japanese red pine Pinus
   densiflora. C. barbinervis seedling establishment was considerably
   reduced on soil probably because there were impediments to colonization
   on the ground, such as the thick litter layer, which was less well
   developed on logs. In contrast, larger-seeded species such as Aphananthe
   aspera, Carpinus spp., Quercus serrata, and Rhus trichocarpa
   preferentially established on soil. Characteristics of wood
   decomposition by fungi varied among logs, and this variability
   significantly influenced C barbinervis seedling density. Seedling
   density was significantly higher on brown-rotted logs than that on logs
   belonging to other decay types. Wood pH was lower in brown-rotted logs
   than that in logs belonging to other decay types and was negatively
   correlated with seedling density. Thus, pine coarse woody debris and the
   functional diversity of wood inhabiting fungi influence the
   establishment of diverse tree seedlings in this abandoned Japanese
   coppice forest. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{345-354}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Litter decay rates often correlate with the initial ratios of lignin :
   nitrogen (N) or lignin : cellulose in litter. However, the chemical and
   microbial mechanisms that give rise to these patterns are still unclear.
   To identify these mechanisms, we studied the decomposition of a model
   plant system, Arabidopsis thaliana, in which plants were manipulated to
   have low levels of lignin, cellulose, or litter N. Nitrogen fertilizer
   often increases the loss of cellulose, but it suppresses the breakdown
   of lignin in plant litter. To understand the mechanisms driving these
   patterns, we decomposed plants in litterbags for one year in control and
   N-fertilized plots in an Alaskan boreal forest. We found that litter N
   had a positive effect on total mass loss because it increased the loss
   of lignin, N, and soluble C. Lignin had a negative effect on rates of
   total litter mass loss due to decreases in the loss of cellulose and
   hemicellulose. Cellulose had a positive effect on lignin loss,
   supporting the concept of a ``priming effect'' for lignin breakdown.
   However, the low-cellulose plants also lost more of their original
   cellulose compared to the other plant types, indicating that decomposers
   mined the litter for cellulose despite the presence of lignin.
   Low-lignin litter had higher fungal biomass and N-acetyl glucosaminidase
   (NAG, a chitinase) activity, suggesting that lignin restricted fungal
   growth and may have influenced competitive interactions between
   decomposers. Nitrogen fertilization increased NAG activity in the early
   stages of decay. In the later stages, N fertilization led to increased
   cellulase activity on the litters and tended to reduce lignin losses.
   The transition over time from competition among decomposers to high
   cellulase activity and suppressed lignin loss under N fertilization
   suggests that, in N-limited systems, N fertilization may alter
   decomposer community structure by favoring a shift toward cellulose- and
   mineral-N users.}},

   1. During the next century, atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is
   projected to more than double, potentially leading to a decline in plant
   diversity as well as a change in plant community composition and
   structure.
   2. In a decade-long field experiment, simulated atmospheric N deposition
   has slowed litter decay, resulting in an accumulation of forest floor
   (i.e. Oi \& Oe horizons). We reasoned that a greater forest floor mass
   under simulated N deposition would impose a physical barrier to sugar
   maple Acer saccharum seedling establishment, thereby reducing seedling
   populations of an ecologically and economically important tree species.
   3. To test this idea, we first quantified sugar maple seedling abundance
   in replicate northern hardwood forest stands receiving ambient
   atmospheric N (7-12 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and experimental atmospheric N
   deposition, simulating future amounts in eastern North America (ambient
   plus 30 kg NO3-) N ha(-1) year(-1)). Then, we experimentally manipulated
   forest floor mass under ambient and simulated N deposition treatments.
   Finally, we transplanted first-year established seedlings into areas
   receiving ambient and simulated N deposition and quantified their
   mortality after 1 year.
   4. First-year seedling abundance did not differ under ambient and
   simulated N deposition; however, there were greater abundances of
   second-and third-to-fifth-year seedlings under ambient N deposition (P <
   0.001). In all cases, experimental manipulation to increase forest floor
   mass, equivalent to that under simulated N deposition, resulted in
   significantly (P = 0.001) fewer established individuals, regardless of
   whether the greater forest floor mass occurred under ambient or
   simulated N deposition. Finally, fewer 1-year-old transplanted seedlings
   survived when grown under simulated N, albeit that result was not
   statistically significant.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The slowing of decay and the accumulation
   of forest floor under anthropogenic N deposition can negatively impact
   seedling survival and potentially alter stand development and structural
   diversity. As atmospheric N deposition increases globally, it becomes
   necessary to understand the mechanisms that lead to population changes
   for ecologically important tree species. The responses we document
   should be considered in simulations of future of forest dynamics, as
   atmospheric N deposition continues to increase, specifically when sugar
   maple life-history traits are included to simulate regeneration,
   structural diversity and stand development.}},

Abstract = {{Soils of coniferous forest ecosystems are important for the global
   carbon cycle, and the identification of active microbial decomposers is
   essential for understanding organic matter transformation in these
   ecosystems. By the independent analysis of DNA and RNA, whole
   communities of bacteria and fungi and its active members were compared
   in topsoil of a Picea abies forest during a period of organic matter
   decomposition. Fungi quantitatively dominate the microbial community in
   the litter horizon, while the organic horizon shows comparable amount of
   fungal and bacterial biomasses. Active microbial populations obtained by
   RNA analysis exhibit similar diversity as DNA-derived populations, but
   significantly differ in the composition of microbial taxa. Several
   highly active taxa, especially fungal ones, show low abundance or even
   absence in the DNA pool. Bacteria and especially fungi are often
   distinctly associated with a particular soil horizon. Fungal communities
   are less even than bacterial ones and show higher relative abundances of
   dominant species. While dominant bacterial species are distributed
   across the studied ecosystem, distribution of dominant fungi is often
   spatially restricted as they are only recovered at some locations. The
   sequences of cbhI gene encoding for cellobiohydrolase (exocellulase), an
   essential enzyme for cellulose decomposition, were compared in soil
   metagenome and metatranscriptome and assigned to their producers. Litter
   horizon exhibits higher diversity and higher proportion of expressed

Abstract = {{Non-native tree species have been widely planted or have become
   naturalized in most forested landscapes. It is not clear if native trees
   species collectively differ in ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) diversity
   and communities from that of non-native tree species. Alternatively, EMF
   species community similarity may be more determined by host plant
   phylogeny than by whether the plant is native or non-native. We examined
   these unknowns by comparing two genera, native and non-native Quercus
   robur and Quercus rubra and native and non-native Pinus sylvestris and
   Pinus nigra in a 35-year-old common garden in Poland. Using molecular
   and morphological approaches, we identified EMF species from
   ectomycorrhizal root tips and sporocarps collected in the monoculture
   tree plots. A total of 69 EMF species were found, with 38 species
   collected only as sporocarps, 18 only as ectomycorrhizas, and 13 both as
   ectomycorrhizas and sporocarps. The EMF species observed were all native
   and commonly associated with a Holarctic range in distribution. We found
   that native Q. robur had ca. 120\% higher total EMF species richness
   than the non-native Q. rubra, while native P. sylvestris had ca. 25\%
   lower total EMF species richness than non-native P. nigra. Thus, across
   genera, there was no evidence that native species have higher EMF
   species diversity than exotic species. In addition, we found a higher
   similarity in EMF communities between the two Pinus species than between
   the two Quercus species. These results support the naturalization of
   non-native trees by means of mutualistic associations with cosmopolitan

Journal = {{ACTA PROTOZOOLOGICA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{259-269}},
Abstract = {{Testate amoebae (TA) are an important part of soil microbial communities
   and in certain ecosystems they may represent a substantial proportion of
   total microbial biomass. Their distribution and abundance is driven by
   various abiotic factors (e.g., pH, organic matter, soil moisture,
   soil/water chemistry) but comparatively less is known about the role of
   biotic interactions. TA often co-occur with Ericaceae, a ubiquitous
   plant family inhabiting acidic soils with poor nutrient status.
   Ericaceae can significantly change soil properties through production of
   recalcitrant litter and possibly also due to root exudates and
   activities of root-inhabiting fungi; this may result in profound
   modifications of microbial communities. A recent study from northwest
   England showed that the invasive ericaceous shrub Rhododendron ponticum
   may significantly modify communities of soil TA. Here, we investigate
   the effect of pH, organic matter, and R. ponticum presence on TA
   communities within the native range of the ericaceous shrub at two sites
   in southern Spain and compare our results with the previous study from
   NW England. At the Spanish sites, organic matter content, R. ponticum
   presence and pH affected occurrence and abundance of several TA species;
   R. ponticum presence and organic matter content were highly correlated
   and explained most of the observed variability in TA communities (i.e.
   the effect of the R. ponticum rhizosphere). R. ponticum rhizosphere
   affected especially TA with relatively large tests, i.e., Cyclopyxis
   eurystoma, Phryganella acropodia and Trigonopyxis arcula. Interestingly,
   T. arcula was also positively associated with R. ponticum in the
   previously studied British sites. The rhizosphere of the ericaceous
   shrub appears to have a positive effect on testate amoebae taxon
   richness at the two studied autochthonous Spanish sites but may reduce
   taxon richness in the sites in Britain where R. ponticum is an
   introduced species. Such possible positive/negative effects of

Abstract = {{Glomalin is a hydrophobic, heat-stable, and recalcitrant glycoprotein
   produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The glomalin is extracted from
   the hyphae or from the soil through the use of sodium citrate (20-50 mM;
   pH 7.0 or 8.0) at high temperature (121 degrees C) and is quantified by
   ELISA or Bradford methods. Soil characteristics, climatic conditions,
   land use systems, agricultural practices, presence and type of
   vegetation, among other factors, influence the amount of glomalin
   produced by AMF. The `glue' property of glomalin helps to fixate soil
   particles, favoring the formation of stable aggregates. Glomalin
   sequesters heavy metals, reducing the availability and the risk of
   toxicity of these elements for organisms and plants grown in polluted
   soils. Depending on the extraction procedure and the origin of the soil,
   between 28 to 45\% dry weight of the glomalin molecule is carbon and 0.9
   to 7.3\% is nitrogen, representing up to 4 to 5\% of total C and N of
   the soil. Despite the important contribution of glomalin, studies are
   needed to reformulate the extraction protocol and to identify its
   physiological function for the AMF, their stocks in different
   ecosystems, the organisms responsible for its decomposition and
   consumption, and the AMF species producing more of this protein in the
   soil.}},

Abstract = {{Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi (ERM) may specialize in capturing nutrients

   know little about the structure of ERM fungal communities and the
   genetic basis of their saprotrophic traits (e.g., genes encoding
   extracellular enzymes). Rhododendron maximum is a model ERM understory
   shrub that influences the nutrient cycles of montane hardwood forests in
   the southern Appalachians (North Carolina, USA). We sampled ERM roots of
   R. maximum from organic and mineral soil horizons and identified root
   fungi by amplifying and sequencing internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
   ribosomal DNA (rDNA) collected from cultures and clones. We observed 71
   fungal taxa on ERM roots, including known symbionts Rhizoscyphus ericae
   and Oidiodendron maius, putative symbionts from the Helotiales,
   Chaetothyriales, and Sebacinales, ectomycorrhizal symbionts, and
   saprotrophs. Supporting the idea that ERM fungi are adept saprotrophs,
   richness of root-fungi was greater in organic than in mineral soil
   horizons. To study the genetic diversity of oxidative enzymes that
   contribute to decomposition, we amplified and sequenced a portion of
   genes encoding multicopper oxidases (MCOs) from ERM ascomycetes. Most
   fungi possessed multiple copies of MCO sequences with strong
   similarities to known ferroxidases and laccases. Our findings indicate
   that R. maximum associates with a taxonomically and ecologically diverse
   fungal community. The study of MCO gene diversity and expression may be
   useful for understanding how ERM root fungi regulate the cycling of

Pages = {{2099-2110}},
Abstract = {{Distinct aggregations of fungal hyphae and rhizomorphs, or ``mats{''},
   formed by some genera of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi are common features
   of soils in coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest. We measured in
   situ respiration rates of Piloderma mats and neighboring non-mat soils
   in an old-growth Douglas-fir forest in western Oregon to investigate
   whether there was higher respiration from mats, and to estimate mat
   contributions to total soil respiration. We found that areas where
   Piloderma mats colonized the organic horizon often had higher soil
   surface flux than nonmats, with the relative increase in respiration
   averaging 16\% across two growing seasons. Both soil physical factors
   and biochemistry were related to the higher surface flux of mat soils.
   When soil moisture was high, soil CO2 production was concentrated into
   near-surface soil horizons where mats tend to colonize, resulting in
   greater apparent differences in respiration between mat and non-mat
   soils. Respiration rates were also correlated with the activity of
   chitin-degrading soil enzymes. This finding supports the notion that the
   abundance of fungal biomass in EcM mats is an important driver of C and
   N cycling. We found Piloderma mats present across 57\% of the exposed
   soil, and use this value to estimate a respiratory contribution from
   mats at the stand-scale of about 9\% of total soil respiration. The
   activity of EcM mats, which includes both EcM fungi and microbial
   associates, appeared to constitute a substantial portion of total soil
   respiration in this old-growth Douglas-fir forest.}},

Abstract = {{Saprotrophic microbes are typically credited with producing
   extracellular enzymes that recycle organic matter, though roots and

   the mycorrhizospheres of arbuscular mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal,
   dual-colonized (arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal), and ericoid mycorrhizal
   plants in a fire chronosequence in Alaska. Bulk soil and soil from
   beneath host plants were gathered in July 2004 and assayed for five
   enzymes that target organic C, P, and N substrates. Compared to bulk
   soil, activities of the C-targeting enzymes beta-1,4-glucosidase and
   peroxidase were lower in arbuscular mycorrhizospheres and ericoid
   mycorrhizospheres, respectively. Moreover, extracellular enzyme activity
   varied among mycorrhizosphere types. Specifically, N-targeting leucine
   aminopeptidase was highest in arbuscular mycorrhizospheres, followed by
   ericoid and ectomycorrhizal/dual-colonized mycorrhizospheres;
   beta-1,4-glucosidase had the reverse pattern. In addition, enzymatic

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal fungal tissues comprise a significant forest-litter

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{94-109}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A process-based modeling framework is developed to examine the control
   that the soil moisture and soil carbon dynamics have on phosphorus (P)
   availability. The model accounts for soil moisture controls on several
   key fluxes that regulate P availability, including the decomposition
   rate of litter and humus, the mortality rate of microbes, the plant P
   demand and leaching of P from the rooting zone. To examine these
   dynamics over a wide range of time scales (i.e., from daily to seasonal
   to annual) we couple a zero-dimensional stochastic soil moisture model
   with a soil carbon model and a soil P model, all of which are run at the
   daily time scale. The soil carbon model accounts for the dynamics of the
   litter pool, humus pool, and microbial biomass pool, while the soil P
   model includes two inorganic P pools and four organic P pools that are
   coupled with the soil carbon pools. A mechanism is included in this
   framework to account for the contribution of enzymatic release to P
   availability, which has been shown to be an important source of P under
   conditions of low P availability. The model is applied to a Cerrado
   ecosystem located in Central Brazil where the phosphorus, carbon and
   hydrologic cycles have been well documented. Despite this application to
   a specific system, the modeling framework developed here is general and
   could be applied to any P-limited ecosystem for studies that seek to
   examine the controls on P-availability over time scales ranging from
   weeks to years. Results indicate that the model accurately captures the
   key driving variables controlling both the short-term (i.e., day to
   week) and long-term (i.e., year to decade) phosphorus, soil moisture and
   carbon dynamics. The effect of stochastic rainfall variability on P
   cycling is examined by running long-term simulations to obtain a
   probabilistic characterization of the state variables and fluxes under
   different rainfall regimes. The effect of a change in the precipitation
   regime suggests that such changes can significantly affect the dynamics
   of state variables and fluxes controlling P-availability. Moreover,
   results from the model illustrate the importance of the microbial
   retention of P. as a P cycling and conserving mechanism for P-limited
   ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Species richness, abundance and composition of epigeous macrofungi were
   monitored at 48 grids across four jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest
   ecosystems in south-west Western Australia as part of an integrated
   monitoring project to examine responses to different timber harvesting
   and regeneration treatments. Forest that had never been harvested or had
   not been harvested for over 40 years was used as a reference, and
   compared to forest that had undergone shelterwood/selective cutting and
   gap release treatment after 1988. Silvicultural treatment also included
   post-harvest burning. All epigeous species of macrofungi and their
   abundance were recorded from autumn surveys at each grid. A total of 450
   species were recorded. Overall mean species richness and abundance was
   similar but the composition of species assemblages contributing to
   macrofungal communities differed significantly between silvicultural
   treatments and reference forest. Sixty-nine species were restricted to
   reference forest while 35 were restricted to shelterwood/selective cut
   and 62 to gap release treatment. In all treatments, the overall mean
   number of species per grid recorded fruiting on soil was 2-4 times
   higher than that recorded on litter or wood. Species richness of
   sporophores recorded on both soil and litter was similar for all
   treatments, but was significantly lower on wood in reference forest
   compared to the gap release treatment. Mean sporophore abundance was
   significantly higher on litter and lower on wood in reference forest
   compared with silviculturally treated forest. Because fire is an
   integral part of jarrah forest silviculture, it was not possible to
   separate the singular effect that either tree removal or fire had on
   macrofungal communities. However, in different time-since-treatment
   classes the overall composition of species assemblages was different,
   but species richness and abundance for each silvicultural treatment were
   similar. Each forest ecosystem supported its own unique fungal
   community, which supports the concept of ecosystems in jarrah forest
   based on forest structure and understory vegetation resulting from
   variation in climate, soils and landforms. Current conservation policy
   and silviculture practice in jarrah forest produces a landscape mosaic
   containing early succession stands through to mature forest across the
   landscape, which is important for the maintenance of fungal
   biodiversity. Much of the fungal population in jarrah forest, however,
   remains unknown and only a long-term commitment to survey and monitoring
   will improve knowledge on the diversity and ecology of these important

Pages = {{362-374}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Boreal ecosystems store 10-20\% of global soil carbon and may warm by
   4-7 degrees C over the next century. Higher temperatures could increase
   the activity of boreal decomposers and indirectly affect decomposition
   through other ecosystem feedbacks. For example, permafrost melting will
   likely alleviate constraints on microbial decomposition and lead to
   greater soil CO2 emissions. However, wet boreal ecosystems underlain by
   permafrost are often CH4 sources, and permafrost thaw could ultimately
   result in drier soils that consume CH4, thereby offsetting some of the
   greenhouse warming potential of soil CO2 emissions. Climate change is
   also likely to increase winter precipitation and snow depth in boreal
   regions, which may stimulate decomposition by moderating soil
   temperatures under the snowpack. As temperatures and evapotranspiration
   increase in the boreal zone, fires may become more frequent, leading to
   additional permafrost loss from burned ecosystems. Although post-fire
   decomposition could also increase due to higher soil temperatures,
   reductions in microbial biomass and activity may attenuate this
   response. Other feedbacks such as soil drying, increased nutrient
   mineralization, and plant species shifts are either weak or uncertain.
   We conclude that strong positive feedbacks to decomposition will likely
   depend on permafrost thaw, and that climate feedbacks will probably be
   weak or negative in boreal ecosystems without permafrost. However,
   warming manipulations should be conducted in a broader range of boreal
   systems to validate these predictions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The

Abstract = {{Fine root acclimation to different environmental conditions is crucial
   for growth and sustainability of forest trees. Relatively small changes
   in fine root standing biomass (FRB), morphology or mycorrhizal symbiosis
   may result in a large change in forest carbon, nutrient and water
   cycles. We elucidated the changes in fine root traits and associated
   ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi in 12 Norway spruce stands across a climatic
   and N deposition gradient from subarctic-boreal to temperate regions in
   Europe (68 N-48 N). We analysed the standing FRB and the ectomycorrhizal
   root tip biomass (EcMB, g m(-2)) simultaneously with measurements of the
   EcM root morphological traits (e. g. mean root length, root tissue
   density (RTD), N\% in EcM roots) and frequency of dominating EcM fungi
   in different stands in relation to climate, soil and site
   characteristics. Latitude and N deposition explained the greatest
   proportion of variation in fine root traits. EcMB per stand basal area
   (BA) increased exponentially with latitude: by about 12.7 kg m(-2) with
   an increase of 10 latitude from southern Germany to Estonia and southern
   Finland and by about 44.7 kg m(-2) with next latitudinal 10 from
   southern to northern Finland. Boreal Norway spruce forests had 4.5 to 11
   times more EcM root tips per stand BA, and the tips were 2.1 times
   longer, with 1.5 times higher RTD and about 1/3 lower N concentration.
   There was 19\% higher proportion of root tips colonized by long-distance
   exploration type forming EcM fungi in the southern forests indicating
   importance of EcM symbiont foraging strategy in fine root nutrient
   acquisition. In the boreal zone, we predict ca. 50\% decrease in EcMB
   per stand BA with an increase of 2 degrees C annual mean temperature.
   Different fine root foraging strategies in boreal and temperate forests
   highlight the importance of complex studies on respective regulatory
   mechanisms in changing climate.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition affects many natural processes,
   including forest litter decomposition. Saprotrophic fungi are the only
   organisms capable of completely decomposing lignocellulosic (woody)
   litter in temperate ecosystems, and therefore the responses of fungi to
   N deposition are critical in understanding the effects of global change
   on the forest carbon cycle. Plant litter decomposition under elevated N
   has been intensively studied, with varying results. The complexity of
   forest floor biota and variability in litter quality have obscured
   N-elevation effects on decomposers. Field experiments often utilize
   standardized substrates and N-levels, but few studies have controlled
   the decay organisms. Decomposition of beech (Fagus sylvatica) blocks
   inoculated with two cord-forming basidiomycete fungi, Hypholoma
   fasciculare and Phanerochaete velutina, was compared experimentally
   under realistic levels of simulated N deposition at Wytham Wood,
   Oxfordshire, UK. Mass loss was greater with P. velutina than with H.
   fasciculare, and with N treatment than in the control. Decomposition was
   accompanied by growth of the fungal mycelium and increasing N
   concentration in the remaining wood. We attribute the N effect on wood
   decay to the response of cord-forming wood decay fungi to N
   availability. Previous studies demonstrated the capacity of these fungi
   to scavenge and import N to decaying wood via a translocating network of
   mycelium. This study shows that small increases in N availability can
   increase wood decomposition by these organisms. Dead wood is an
   important carbon store and habitat. The responses of wood decomposers to
   anthropogenic N deposition should be considered in models of forest
   carbon dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Current knowledge of the succession of fungi in decaying wood is mostly
   based on fruit bodies and in vitro culture. Here, we investigated the
   changing community of metabolically active fungi during the

   amplicons of the 18S and ITS regions in 21 isolates and discuss the use
   of RNA as a marker of metabolically active fungi. The richness of active
   fungi, revealed as separated bands in DGGE, peaked in logs at an
   advanced stage of decay. Soft-rot fungi were common in the early stages
   but white- and brown-rot fungi became dominant as decay progressed.
   Ectomycorrhizal fungi were detected at an early stage, and they became
   the most abundant group in the late stages of succession. A comparison
   of rRNA-derived amplicons revealed that although ITS was detected in the
   form of precursor rRNA, introns within 18S rDNA were already spliced. As
   such, rRNA- and rDNA-derived amplicons would yield different profiles of

Abstract = {{Questions: How does the abundance and richness of plant assemblages with
   different functional (regeneration and nutrient acquisition) traits vary
   with fire regime, moisture availability and substrate fertility? What is
   the role of different functional traits in maintaining plant diversity
   under changing environmental conditions in seasonally dry and fire-prone
   environments?
   Location: Southwest Western Australia.
   Methods: Plant species abundance and soil nutrients were determined at
   16 forest sites with variable fire histories across an aridity gradient.
   All plant species were classified based on their functional traits as
   (1) perennial or annual, (2) ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal,
   ericoid mycorrhizal, orchid mycorrhizal, proteoid or other
   non-mycorrhizal, (3) resprouters or seeder, and (4) nitrogen fixer or
   non-fixer. We used a multivariate (fourth-corner) technique to
   simultaneously test the significance and direction of the relationship
   between each of these traits and fire frequency, fire interval length,
   aridity, and soil N, P and C fractions.
   Results: The functional response of the vegetation to fire regime was
   minor and restricted to annual species, which comprised only similar to
   4\% of taxa. Proteoid and ectomycorrhizal species dominated over species
   with arbuscular and orchid mycorrhizal roots, N-fixers dominated over
   non-fixers, and seeders dominated over resprouters when N fertility was
   low but organic labile P was high. Further, proteoid and ectomycorrhizal
   species richness increased with aridity, while arbuscular mycorrhizal
   species richness decreased.
   Conclusions: While the functional composition of southwest Australian
   vegetation is largely insensitive to changes in fire regime, nutrient
   acquisition and, to a lesser extent, regeneration traits provide
   mechanisms for the vegetation community to adjust to changes in resource
   availability. Thus, diversity responses to environmental change in
   seasonally dry and fire-prone ecosystems are likely to be primarily
   mediated by the composition of nutrient acquisition traits in the
   vegetation community.}},

Abstract = {{Forest dieback caused by climate-change associated stresses and insect
   outbreaks has emerged as a global concern, and the biogeochemical
   consequences of this phenomenon need to be elucidated. We measured
   biological and chemical traits of soil beneath live trees or trees
   recently killed by a mountain-pine-beetle outbreak in a subalpine
   coniferous forest in the Front Range of Colorado. We focused on the top
   5 cm of mineral soil just beneath the O horizon and measured microbial
   biomass, soil invertebrate abundance and composition, and soil chemical
   characteristics. With the termination of inputs from rhizodeposition,
   mycorrhizal fungal turnover and fine root turnover, soil total carbon
   (C) and total nitrogen (N) in the mineral soil at three sites decreased
   by 38-49\% and 26-45\%, respectively. Tree mortality was associated with
   reduced soil microbial biomass but soil nematode and microarthropod
   densities were unchanged. Nematode trophic structure was altered with an
   increased proportion of bacterial feeders. Soil inorganic N
   concentrations were inversely correlated to microbial C:N ratios. Tree
   death was associated with increased soil pH, a possible loss of calcium
   (Ca2+), but an accumulation of soil inorganic N, largely as NH4+. Our
   results suggest that forest dieback results in rapid C and N loss from
   surface mineral soils and that the accumulation of soil inorganic N, the
   reduction in microbial biomass, and the more bacterial-based soil food
   web increase the potential of enhanced N loss from affected ecosystems.

Abstract = {{Within the framework of Sikfokut DIRT (Detritus Input and Removal
   Treatments) Project, we have been examining the extent to which
   microbial activities of soils are influenced by detritus inputs of
   diverse quantities and qualities. The experimental site is located in
   the south part of the Bukk Mountains in North Eastern Hungary. This
   forest is a semi-natural stand (Quercetum petraeae-cerris community)
   without forest management
   The six treatments established are as follows: three treatments
   involving detritus removal (No Litter, No Roots, No Inputs), two
   treatments involving detritus duplication (Double Litter, Double Wood)
   and a control treatment The study intends to present the results of
   saccharase and arylsulphatase activity examinations. Our hypothesis was
   that detritus reduction causes significantly greater influence on soil
   enzyme activities than detritus increase of the same extent.
   The general purpose of the project is to reveal the connection between
   modifications of detritus production and changes of climatic conditions
   and land use. It also studies how the modifications, decreases or
   increases in detritus production influence organic material content, and
   physical, chemical or biological processes of soils. Saccharase and
   arylsulphatase activities were measured three and a half years after the
   establishment of the plots; thus having enough time for the development
   of different ecological conditions at our disposal. Significant
   differences were detectable between the treatments for both enzymes. Two
   separate groups of treatments could be distinguished. The treatments
   with additional aboveground inputs (Double Litter, Double Wood) and the
   control (C) revealed higher activities, while a lower sometimes
   significantly lower enzyme activity characterized the other three,
   removal treatments (No Litter, No Roots, No Inputs). As for the Double
   Litter, Double Wood and Control treatments, no significant difference
   was detectable, although the latter two revealed higher values of enzyme
   activities than the former one.
   We found that soil moisture content was correlated with the two soil
   enzyme activities, especially that of the arylsulphatase. A much weaker
   correlation was found between the enzyme activities and soil moisture
   content in the soils that were wetter and poorer in substrates (No Roots
   and No Inputs treatments). Seasonal differences also involved the
   diverse moisture contents, while the effect of temperature could hardly
   be observed during the examinations (due to the nature of methods). In
   the case of both enzymes, the highest activities were detected during
   the wetter period, in spring.
   The three detritus removal treatments influenced enzyme activities in
   different ways.
   As for saccharase, it was the removal of belowground detritus that
   caused the greatest influence. However, in the case of arylsulphatase,
   it was the soil moisture content that influenced activity to the
   greatest extent in detritus removal treatments. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

Abstract = {{Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition can increase forest growth. Because
   N deposition commonly increases foliar N concentrations, it is thought
   that this increase in forest growth is a consequence of enhanced
   leaf-level photosynthesis. However, tests of this mechanism have been
   infrequent, and increases in photosynthesis have not been consistently
   observed in mature forests subject to chronic N deposition. In four
   mature northern hardwood forests in the north-central United States,
   chronic N additions (30 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1) as NaNO3 for 14 years) have
   increased aboveground growth but have not affected canopy leaf biomass
   or leaf area index. In order to understand the mechanism behind the
   increases in growth, we hypothesized that the NO3- additions increased
   foliar N concentrations and leaf-level photosynthesis in the dominant
   species in these forests (sugar maple, Acer saccharum). The NO3-
   additions significantly increased foliar N. However, there was no
   significant difference between the ambient and +NO3- treatments in two
   seasons (2006-2007) of instantaneous measurements of photosynthesis from
   either canopy towers or excised branches. In measurements on excised
   branches, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (mu mol CO2.s(-1).g(-1)
   N) was significantly decreased (-13\%) by NO3- additions. Furthermore,
   we found no consistent NO3- effect across all sites in either current
   foliage or leaf litter collected annually throughout the study
   (1993-2007) and analyzed for delta C-13 and delta O-18, isotopes that
   can be used together to integrate changes in photosynthesis over time.
   We observed a small but significant NO3- effect on the average area and
   mass of individual leaves from the excised branches, but these
   differences varied by site and were countered by changes in leaf number.
   These photosynthesis and leaf area data together suggest that NO3-
   additions have not stimulated photosynthesis. There is no evidence that
   nutrient deficiencies have developed at these sites, so unlike other
   studies of photosynthesis in N-saturated forests, we cannot attribute
   the lack of a stimulation of photosynthesis to nutrient limitations.
   Rather than increases in C assimilation, the observed increases in
   aboveground growth at our study sites are more likely due to shifts in C
   allocation.}},

Abstract = {{A substantial portion of the carbon (C) fixed by the trees is allocated
   belowground to ectomycorrhizal (EM) symbionts, but this fraction usually
   declines after fertilization. The aim of the present study was to
   estimate the effect of optimal fertilization (including all the
   necessary nutrients) on the growth of EM fungi in young Norway spruce
   forests over a three year period. In addition, the amount of carbon
   sequestered by EM mycelia was estimated using a method based on the
   difference in delta C-13 between C-3 and C-4 plants. Sand-filled
   ingrowth mesh bags were used to estimate EM growth, and similar bags
   amended with compost made from maize leaves (a C-4 plant) were used to
   estimate C sequestration. Fertilizers had been applied either every year
   or every second year since 2002 and the estimates of EM growth started
   in 2007. The application of fertilizer reduced EM growth to between 0\%
   and 40\% of the growth in the control plots at one site (Ebbegarde),
   while no significant effect was found at the other three sites studied.
   The effect of the fertilizer was similar in sand-filled and
   maize-compost-amended mesh bags, but the total production of EM fungi
   was 3-4 times higher in maize-compost-amended mesh bags. The fertilizer
   tended to reduce EM growth more when applied every year than when
   applied every second year. The amount of C sequestered in
   maize-compost-amended mesh bags collected from unfertilized treatments
   was estimated to be between 0.2 and 0.7 mg C g sand(-1) at Ebbegarde and
   between 0.2 and 0.5 mg C g sand(-1) at Grangshammar. This corresponds to
   between 300 and 1100 kg C per ha, assuming a similar production in the
   soil as in the mesh bags. Fertilization at the Ebbegarde site reduced
   carbon sequestration, which confirmed the results based on estimates of
   fungal growth (ergosterol levels). A correlation was found between
   fungal biomass and delta C-13 in mesh bags amended with maize compost.
   Based on this, it was estimated that a fungal production of 1 mu g
   ergosterol corresponded to 0.33 mg of sequestered carbon. In conclusion,
   the effect of the fertilizer on EM growth seemed to be dependent on the
   effect of the fertilizer on tree growth. Thus, at Ebbegarde, were tree
   growth was less stimulated by the fertilizer, EM growth was reduced upon
   fertilization. At other sites, where tree growth was more stimulated,
   the fertilizer did not influence EM growth. The large amounts of carbon
   sequestered during the experiment may be a result of fungal residues
   remaining in the soil after the death of the hyphae. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{Plant litter decomposition is a critical ecosystem process representing
   a major pathway for carbon flux, but little is known about how it is
   affected by changes in plant composition and diversity. Single plant
   functional groups (graminoids, legumes, non-leguminous forbs) were
   removed from a grassland in northern Canada to examine the impacts of
   functional group identity on decomposition. Removals were conducted
   within two different environmental contexts (fertilization and fungicide
   application) to examine the context-dependency of these identity
   effects. We examined two different mechanisms by which the loss of plant
   functional groups may impact decomposition: effects of the living plant
   community on the decomposition microenvironment, and changes in the
   species composition of the decomposing litter, as well as the
   interaction between these mechanisms. We show that the identity of the
   plant functional group removed affects decomposition through both
   mechanisms. Removal of both graminoids and forbs slowed decomposition
   through changes in the decomposition microenvironment. We found
   non-additive effects of litter mixing, with both the direction and
   identity of the functional group responsible depending on year; in 2004
   graminoids positively influenced decomposition whereas in 2006 forbs
   negatively influenced decomposition rate. Although these two mechanisms
   act independently, their effects may be additive if both mechanisms are
   considered simultaneously. It is essential to understand the variety of
   mechanisms through which even a single ecosystem property is affected if
   we are to predict the future consequences of biodiversity loss.}},

Abstract = {{1. Soil micro-organisms play important roles in ecosystems and respond
   quickly to environmental changes. We examined how understory removal and
   tree girdling influence the composition of soil microbial community and
   the litter decomposition in two subtropical plantations.
   2. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis was used to characterize
   soil microbial community. Redundancy analysis and principal response
   curves (PRC) were used to investigate the relationships between soil
   microbial community and environmental factors.
   3. Understory removal significantly reduced the amount of fungal PLFAs,
   the ratio of fungal to bacterial PLFAs, and the litter decomposition but
   did not affect bacterial PLFAs and total PLFAs. In contrast, tree
   girdling did not affect the soil microbial characteristics. The changes
   in soil microbial community caused by understory removal were mainly
   attributed to the indirect effects such as increased soil temperature
   and soil NO(3)(-) -N availability. In addition, PRC analysis showed that
   the relative abundance of most PLFAs increased in response to understory
   removal in the 2-year-old plantation but decreased in the 24-year-old
   plantation.
   4. We propose that understory plants are important components in
   subtropical forest ecosystems, and play different roles in maintaining
   soil microbial community and driving litter decomposition processes in
   young vs. old plantations. The functions of understory plants should be
   considered in forest management and restoration. The negligible effect
   of tree girdling on the soil micro-organisms can be attributed to the
   resprouting trait and mycorrhizal interactions of Eucalyptus.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature has generally great effects on both the activity and
   composition of microbial communities in different soils. We tested the
   impact of soil temperature and three different boreal forest tree
   species on the archaeal populations in the bulk soil, rhizosphere, and
   mycorrhizosphere. Scots pine, silver birch, and Norway spruce seedlings
   were grown in forest humus microcosms at three different temperatures,
   7-11.5A degrees C (night-day temperature), 12-16A degrees C, and 16-22A
   degrees C, of which 12-16A degrees C represents the typical mid-summer
   soil temperature in Finnish forests. RNA and DNA were extracted from
   indigenous ectomycorrhiza, non-mycorrhizal long roots, and boreal forest
   humus and tested for the presence of archaea by nested PCR of the
   archaeal 16S rRNA gene followed by denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE) profiling and sequencing. Methanogenic
   Euryarchaeota belonging to Methanolobus sp. and Methanosaeta sp. were
   detected on the roots and mycorrhiza. The most commonly detected
   archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences belonged to group I.1c Crenarchaeota,
   which are typically found in boreal and alpine forest soils.
   Interestingly, also one sequence belonging to group I.1b Crenarchaeota
   was detected from Scots pine mycorrhiza although sequences of this group
   are usually found in agricultural and forest soils in temperate areas.
   Tree- and temperature-related shifts in the archaeal population
   structure were observed. A clear decrease in crenarchaeotal DGGE band
   number was seen with increasing temperature, and correspondingly, the
   number of euryarchaeotal DGGE bands, mostly methanogens, increased. The
   greatest diversity of archaeal DGGE bands was detected in Scots pine
   roots and mycorrhizas. No archaea were detected from humus samples from
   microcosms without tree seedling, indicating that the archaea found in
   the mycorrhizosphere and root systems were dependent on the plant host.
   The detection of archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences from both RNA and DNA
   extractions show that the archaeal populations were living and that they
   may have significant contribution to the methane cycle in boreal forest
   soil, especially when soil temperatures rise.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{891-898}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. The existence of many types of monodominant forests is readily
   explainable by ecological theory (e.g. early successional forests).
   Nevertheless, monodominant stands sometimes occur in areas where a much
   higher diversity typically occurs. Such `classical monodominance' is not
   currently readily explained by ecological theory.
   2. We briefly review the published mechanisms suggested to cause
   classical monodominance and then combine them into a new probabilistic
   conceptual framework to better understand why these systems occur. We
   build on two theories proposed to explain monodominance: a lack of
   exogenous disturbance over long periods and species-specific
   life-history traits. We suggest that certain traits under certain
   conditions may generate positive feedbacks leading to a greater
   probability of monodominance being achieved. Such positive feedbacks
   have the potential to drive a typically diverse system towards a
   monodominant one.
   3. Synthesis. Classical monodominance in tropical forests is
   hypothesized to be attained when a group of traits occur together under
   low exogenous disturbance conditions, this giving rise to a series of
   positive feedbacks. The presented framework links the differing
   mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain classical monodominance
   and shows there are potentially alternative routes to monodominance,
   thus reconciling apparently contradictory observational and experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The two components of soil respiration, autotrophic respiration (from
   roots, mycorrhizal hyphae and associated microbes) and heterotrophic
   respiration (from decomposers), was separated in a root trenching
   experiment in a Norway spruce forest. In June 2003, cylinders (29.7 cm
   diameter) were inserted to 50 cm soil depth and respiration was measured
   both outside (control) and inside the trenched areas. The potential
   problems associated with the trenching treatment, increased
   decomposition of roots and ectomycorrhizal mycelia and changed soil
   moisture conditions, were handled by empirical modelling. The model was
   calibrated with respiration, moisture and temperature data of 2004 from
   the trenched plots as a training set. We estimate that over the first 5
   months after the trenching, 45\% of respiration from the trenched plots
   was an artefact of the treatment. Of this, 29\% was a water difference
   effect and 16\% resulted from root and mycelia decomposition.
   Autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration contributed to about 50\% each
   of total soil respiration in the control plots averaged over the two
   growing seasons. We show that the potential problems with the trenching,

Abstract = {{A soil module was developed to improve on the ecosystem-scale
   simulations of forest models. The module includes simulations of
   bacteria, mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal fungi. The inclusion of these
   soil organisms allows for the simulation of several soil biological
   processes in a more mechanistic way. In this paper the soil module is
   used in combination with the forest model ANAFORE (ANAlysing Forest
   Ecosystems) a stand-scale forest model that simulates wood tissue
   development, carbon (C) and water (H(2)O) fluxes dynamically from
   physiological principles. Although the main purpose of this paper is the
   model description, a showcase run of the new soil model was performed
   using a Bayesian parameterization procedure for 16 forest sites
   (pedunculate oak, beech, Scots pine and poplar) on different soils in
   Belgium. Emphasis was on the soil organic horizons formation. The
   results show that one single parameter set could be used for the
   different forests in the study, and yielded reasonably close fits for
   most sites concerning pH and formation of the humus layer. Although
   running the Bayesian procedure to obtain good input parameter
   distributions was time-consuming (several months), runs using the
   developed parameter set are reasonably fast (days). These results are
   promising. However, the high uncertainty of both the input and the
   output of the model indicates that it is mainly useful as an
   experimental tool, rather than a predictive instrument. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) limits plant growth in many forest ecosystems. The largest
   N pool in the plant soil system is typically organic, contained
   primarily within the living plants and in the humus and litter layers of
   the soil. Understanding the pathways by which plants obtain N is a
   priority for clarifying N cycling processes in forest ecosystems. In
   this review, the interactions between saprotrophic microorganisms and
   ectomycorrhizal fungi in N nutrition with a focus on the ability of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi to circumvent N mineralization for the nutrition
   of plants in forest ecosystems will be discussed. Traditionally, it is
   believed that in order for plants to fulfill their N requirements, they
   primarily utilize ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). In temperate
   forest ecosystems, many woody plants form ectomycorrhizas which
   significantly improves phosphorus (P) and N acquisition by plants. Under
   laboratory conditions, ectomycorrhizal fungi have also been proven to be
   able to obtain N from organic sources such as protein. It was thus
   proposed that ectomycorrhizal fungi potentially circumvent the standard
   N cycle involving N mineralization by saprotrophic microorganisms.
   However, in many forest ecosystems the majority of the proteins in the
   forest floor form complexes with polyphenols. Direct access of N by
   ectomycorrhizal fungi from a polyphenol protein complex may be limited.
   Ectomycorrhizal fungi may depend on saprotrophic microorganisms to
   liberate organic N sources from polyphenol complexes. Thus, interactions
   between saprotrophic microorganisms and ectomycorrhizal fungi are likely
   to be essential in the cycling of N within temperate forest ecosystems.

Abstract = {{The ectomycorrhizal mycelium is a large component of boreal and
   temperate forest soil microbial biomass and the resulting necromass is
   likely to be an important source of nutrients for saprotrophic

   ectomycorrhizal mycelial biomass on short-term CO2 efflux by amending
   forest soil with necromass from 8 fungal species added separately and in
   mixtures of 2, 4 and 8 species. All additions of necromass rapidly
   increased soil CO2 efflux compared to unamended controls but CO2 efflux
   increased significantly with species richness. Efflux of CO2 did not
   correlate with the carbon (C) or nitrogen (N) contents or the C:N ratio
   of the added necromass. The study demonstrates that species diversity of
   dead ectomycorrhizal fungal hyphae can have important consequences for
   soil CO2 efflux, and suggests decomposition of hyphae is regulated by
   specific constituents of the nutrient pools in the necromass rather than

Abstract = {{The long-term effects of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and
   tropospheric O-3 concentrations on fungal communities in soil are not
   well understood. Here, we examine fungal community composition and the
   activities of cellobiohydrolase and N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) after
   10 years of exposure to 1.5 times ambient levels of CO2 and O-3 in aspen
   and aspen-birch forest ecosystems, and compare these results to earlier
   studies in the same long-term experiment. The forest floor community was
   dominated by saprotrophic fungi, and differed slightly between plant
   community types, as did NAG activity. Elevated CO2 and O-3 had small but
   significant effects on the distribution of fungal genotypes in this
   horizon, and elevated CO2 also lead to an increase in the proportion of
   Sistotrema spp. within the community. Yet, although cellobiohydrolase
   activity was lower in the forest floor under elevated O-3, it was not
   affected by elevated CO2. NAG was also unaffected. The soil community
   was dominated by ectomycorrhizal species. Both CO2 and O-3 had a minor
   effect on the distribution of genotypes; however, phylogenetic analysis
   indicated that under elevated O-3 Cortinarius and Inocybe spp. increased
   in abundance and Laccaria and Tomentella spp. declined. Although
   cellobiohydrolase activity in soil was unaffected by either CO2 or O-3,
   NAG was higher (similar to 29\%) under CO2 in aspen-birch, but lower
   (similar to 18\%) under aspen. Time series analysis indicated that CO2
   increased cellulolytic enzyme activity during the first 5 years of the
   experiment, but that the magnitude of this effect diminished over time.
   NAG activity also showed strong early stimulation by elevated CO2, but
   after 10 years this effect is no longer evident. Elevated O-3 appears to
   have variable stimulatory and repressive effects depending on the soil
   horizon and time point examined.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbes in temperate forest ecosystems are able to cycle several
   hundreds of kilograms of N per hectare per year and are therefore of
   paramount importance for N retention. Belowground C allocation by trees
   is an important driver of seasonal microbial dynamics and may thus
   directly affect N transformation processes over the course of the year.
   Our study aimed at unraveling plant controls on soil N cycling in a
   temperate beech forest at a high temporal resolution over a time period
   of two years, by investigating the effects of tree girdling on microbial
   N turnover. In both years of the experiment, we discovered (1) a summer
   N mineralization phase (between July and August) and (2) a winter N
   immobilization phase (November-February). The summer mineralization
   phase was characterized by a high N mineralization activity, low
   microbial N uptake, and a subsequent high N availability in the soil.
   During the autumn/winter N immobilization phase, gross N mineralization
   rates were low, and microbial N uptake exceeded microbial N
   mineralization, which led to high levels of N in the microbial biomass
   and low N availability in the soil. The observed immobilization phase
   during the winter may play a crucial role for ecosystem functioning,
   since it could protect dissolved N that is produced by autumn litter
   degradation from being lost from the ecosystem during the phase when
   plants are mostly inactive. The difference between microbial biomass N
   levels in winter and spring equals 38 kg N/ha and may thus account for
   almost one-third of the annual plant N demand. Tree girdling strongly
   affected annual N cycling: the winter N immobilization phase disappeared
   in girdled plots (microbial N uptake and microbial biomass N were
   significantly reduced, while the amount of available N in the soil
   solution was enhanced). This was correlated to a reduced fungal
   abundance in autumn in girdled plots. By releasing recently fixed
   photosynthates to the soil, plants may thus actively control the annual
   microbial N cycle. Tree belowground C allocation increases N
   accumulation in microorganisms during the winter which may ultimately
   feed back on plant N availability in the following growing season.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge is limited about whether root nutrient concentrations are
   affected by mixtures of tree species and interspecific root competition.
   The goal of this field study was to investigate root nutrient element
   concentrations in relation to root and ectomycorrhizal (EM) diversity in
   six different mixtures of beech (Fagus sylvatica), ash (Fraxinus
   excelsior) and lime (Tilia sp.) in an old-growth, undisturbed forest
   ecosystem. Root biomass and nutrient concentrations per tree taxon as
   well as the abundance and identity of all EM fungi were determined in
   soil cores of a volume of 1 L (r = 40 mm, depth = 200 mm). Stand-level
   nutrient concentrations in overall root biomass and H' (Shannon-Wiener
   diversity) were obtained by pooling the data per stand. At stand level,
   Shannon H' for roots and aboveground tree species abundance were
   correlated. H' for roots and EM fungi were not correlated because of the
   contribution of ash roots that form only arbuscular mycorrhizal but no
   EM associations. Nutrient element concentrations in roots showed
   taxon-related differences and increased in the following order: beech <=
   lime < ash with the exception of calcium (Ca), which was lower in ash.
   Stand-level concentrations of Ca, magnesium, potassium and sulfur in
   roots increased with increasing tree diversity because of two effects:
   increasing contribution of ash roots to the mixture and increasing Ca
   accumulation in beech roots with increasing root diversity. On a small
   scale, increasing root diversity, but not EM diversity, was correlated
   with decreasing P concentrations in beech roots pointing to
   interspecific tree competition. Nitrogen (N) concentrations of beech
   roots were unaltered in relation to root and EM diversity. Opposing
   behavior was observed for lime and ash: the N concentrations in lime
   roots increased, whereas those in ash roots decreased with increasing EM
   diversity in a given soil volume. This suggests that EM diversity
   facilitates N acquisition of lime roots at the expense of non-EM ash.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature and substrate availability constrain the activity of the
   extracellular enzymes that decompose and release nutrients from soil
   organic matter (SOM). Proteolytic enzymes are the primary class of
   enzymes involved in the depolymerization of nitrogen (N) from
   proteinaceous components of SOM, and their activity affects the rate of
   N cycling in forest soils. The objectives of this study were to
   determine whether and how temperature and substrate availability affect
   the activity of proteolytic enzymes in temperate forest soils, and
   whether the activity of proteolytic enzymes and other enzymes involved
   in the acquisition of N (i.e., chitinolytic and ligninolytic enzymes)
   differs between trees species that form associations with either
   ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Temperature limitation
   of proteolytic enzyme activity was observed only early in the growing
   season when soil temperatures in the field were near 4 degrees C.
   Substrate limitation to proteolytic activity persisted well into the
   growing season. Ligninolytic enzyme activity was higher in soils
   dominated by ectomycorrhizal associated tree species. In contrast, the
   activity of proteolytic and chitinolytic enzymes did not differ, but
   there were differences between mycorrhizal association in the control of
   roots on enzyme activity. Roots of ectomycorrhizal species but not those
   of arbuscular mycorrhizal species exerted significant control over
   proteolytic, chitinolytic, and ligninolytic enzyme activity; the absence
   of ectomycorrhizal fine roots reduced the activity of all three enzymes.
   These results suggest that climate warming in the absence of increases
   in substrate availability may have a modest effect on soil-N cycling,
   and that global changes that alter belowground carbon allocation by
   trees are likely to have a larger effect on nitrogen cycling in stands
   dominated by ectomycorrhizal fungi.}},

Abstract = {{In all terrestrial ecosystems, testate amoebae (TA) encounter fungi.
   There are strong indications that both groups engage in multiple
   interactions, including mycophagy and decomposition of TA shells,
   processes which might be fundamental in nutrient cycling in certain
   ecosystems. Here, we present the results of an experiment focusing on
   interactions between TA and saprotrophic microfungi colonizing Scots
   pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) litter needles. The needles were collected
   from a temperate pine forest and cultivated in damp chambers. Over a few
   weeks, melanized mycelium of Anavirga laxa Sutton started to grow out of
   some needles; simultaneously, the common forest-soil TA Phryganella
   acropodia (Hertwig and Lesser) Hopkinson reproduced and spread around
   the mycelium. We investigated whether a potential relationship between
   TA and saprotrophic microfungi exists by comparing the composition of TA
   communities on and around the needles and testing the spatial
   relationship between the A. laxa mycelium and P. acropodia shells in the
   experimental microcosm. Additionally, we asked whether P. acropodia
   utilized the A. laxa mycelium as a nutrient source and screened whether
   P. acropodia shells were colonized by the microfungi inhabiting the
   experimental microcosm. Our results indicate that saprotrophic
   microfungi may affect the composition of TA communities and their
   mycelium may affect distribution of TA individuals in pine litter. Our
   observations suggest that P. acropodia did not graze directly on A. laxa
   mycelium, but rather fed on its exudates or bacteria associated with the
   exudates. The fungus Pochonia bulbillosa (Gams \& Malla) Zare \& Gams
   was often found parasitising encysted shells or decomposing already dead
   individuals of P. acropodia. TA and pine litter microfungi engage in
   various direct and indirect interactions which are still poorly
   understood and deserve further investigation. Their elucidation will
   improve our knowledge on fundamental processes influencing coexistence
   of soil microflora and microfauna.}},

   moving roots into sieved bulk soil. We sampled root fragments repeatedly

   patterns of fungal species composition. Disturbing the root rhizosphere
   prior to initiating decomposition changed the dominant fungal taxa, the
   distribution of dominant species within the community, and the temporal
   development in the culturable fungal community. Dominance in control
   roots shifted from Neonectria in early decay to Umbelopsis in later

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, the mid-Cretaceous amber deposits of Charentes (SW
   France) have been intensively studied. The fossils investigated were not
   only limited to arthropods preserved in amber, but also included
   microorganisms, plant debris and vertebrate remains. This plethora of
   analyses provided important data about the ecology of the overall
   system, including sources of litter input into the soil and of the
   above-ground ecology. More precisely, they showed that most of the
   microfossils were those of soil organisms or organisms that participated
   in the ecology of the forest soil. This new discovery provided the
   opportunity to study the ecology of the soil as preserved in the 100
   million years old Charentes amber. Indeed, the trophic links of the
   fossil forest soil have been reconstructed on the basis of the fossil
   assemblage discovered in amber outcrops and overlayed on a model
   ecological forest soil food web. We relied on existing phylogenetic
   information to discuss the absence of certain taxonomic groups in the
   fossilized specimens. Our synthesis shows that although the organisms of
   this ancient forest of Charentes were different from those of modern
   soils, the soil food web was organized functionally the same as modern
   soils. It also demonstrated that trophic links of the soil community
   were already diverse, including various means of predation, parasitism
   and organic matter decomposition. The most obvious differences are the
   absence of evidence for symbiotic root nitrogen fixation and
   mycorrhizae. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{795-803}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Soil fungi are highly diverse and act as the primary agents of nutrient
   cycling in forests. These fungal communities are often dominated by
   mycorrhizal fungi that form mutually beneficial relationships with plant
   roots and some mycorrhizal fungi produce extracellular and cell-bound
   enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of nitrogen (N)- and phosphorus
   (P)- containing compounds in soil organic matter. Here we investigated
   whether the community structure of different types of mycorrhizal fungi
   (arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi) is correlated with soil chemistry
   and enzyme activity in a northern hardwood forest and whether these
   correlations change over the growing season. We quantified these
   relationships in an experimental paired plot study where white-tailed
   deer (access or excluded 4.5 yrs) treatment was crossed with garlic
   mustard (presence or removal 1 yr). We collected soil samples early and
   late in the growing season and analyzed them for soil chemistry,
   extracellular enzyme activity and molecular analysis of both arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal/saprotrophic fungal communities
   using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP). AM
   fungal communities did not change seasonally but were positively
   correlated with the activities of urease and leucine aminopeptidase
   (LAP), enzymes involved in N cycling. The density of garlic mustard was
   correlated with the presence of specific AM fungal species, while deer
   exclusion or access had no effect on either fungal community after 4.5
   yrs. Ectomycorrhizal/saprotrophic fungal communities changed seasonally
   and were positively correlated with most soil enzymes, including enzymes
   involved in carbon (C), N and P cycling, but only during late summer
   sampling. Our results suggest that fine scale temporal and spatial
   changes in soil fungal communities may affect soil nutrient and carbon
   cycling. Although AM fungi are not generally considered capable of
   producing extracellular enzymes, the correlation between some AM taxa
   and the activity of N acquisition enzymes suggests that these fungi may
   play a role in forest understory N cycling. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{High concentrations of metals in organic matter can inhibit
   decomposition and limit nutrient availability in ecosystems, but the
   long-term fate of metals bound to forest litter is poorly understood.
   Controlled experiments indicate that during the first few years of
   litter decay, Al, Fe, Pb, and other metals that form stable complexes
   with organic matter are naturally enriched by several hundred percent as
   carbon is oxidized. The transformation of fresh litter to humus takes
   decades, however, such that current datasets describing the accumulation
   and release of metals in decomposing organic matter are time-scale
   limited. Here we use atmospheric Pb-210 to quantify the fate of metals
   in canopy-derived litter during burial and decay in coniferous forests
   in New England and Norway where decomposition rates are slow and
   physical soil mixing is minimal. We measure Pb-210 inventories in the O
   horizon and mineral soil and calculate a 60-630 year timescale for the
   production of mobile organo-metallic colloids from the decomposition of
   fresh forest detritus. This production rate is slowest at our highest
   elevation (similar to 1000 m) and highest latitude sites (>63 degrees N)
   where decomposition rates are expected to be low.
   We calculate soil layer ages by assuming a constant supply of
   atmospheric Pb-210 and find that they are consistent with the
   distribution of geochemical tracers from weapons fallout, air pollution,
   and a direct Pb-207 application at one site. By quantifying a gradient
   of organic matter ages with depth in the O horizon, we describe the
   accumulation and loss of metals in the soil profile as organic matter
   transforms from fresh litter to humus. While decomposition experiments
   predict that Al and Fe concentrations increase during the initial few
   years of decay, we show here that these metals continue to accumulate in
   humus for decades, and that enrichment occurs at a rate higher than can
   be explained by quantitative retention during decomposition alone. Acid
   extractable Al and Fe concentrations are higher in the humus layer of
   the O horizon than in the mineral soil immediately beneath this layer:
   it is therefore unlikely that physical soil mixing introduces
   significant Al and Fe to humus. This continuous enrichment of Al and Fe
   over time may best be explained by the recent suggestion that metals are
   mined from deeper horizons and brought into the O horizon via
   mycorrhizal plants. In sharp contrast to Al and Fe, we find that Mn
   concentrations in decomposing litter layers decrease exponentially with
   age, presumably because of leaching or rapid uptake, which may explain
   the low levels of acid extractable Mn in the mineral soil. This study
   quantifies how metals are enriched and lost in decomposing organic
   matter over a longer timescale than previous studies have been able to
   characterize. We also put new limits on the rate at which metals in
   litter become mobile organo-metallic complexes that can migrate to
   deeper soil horizons or surface waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Epipogium aphyllum is a rare Eurasian achlorophyllous forest orchid
   known to associate with fungi that form ectomycorrhizas, while closely
   related orchids of warm humid climates depend on wood- or
   litter-decomposer fungi. We conducted 13C and 15N stable isotope natural
   abundance analyses to identify the organic nutrient source of E.
   aphyllum from Central Norway. These data for orchid shoot tissues, in
   comparison to accompanying autotrophic plants, document C and N flow
   from ectomycorrhizal fungi to the orchid. DNA data from fungal pelotons
   in the orchid root cortex confirm the presence of Inocybe and Hebeloma,
   which are both fungi that form ectomycorrhizas. The enrichment factors
   for 13C and 15N of E. aphyllum are used to calculate a new overall
   average enrichment factor for mycoheterotrophic plants living in
   association with ectomycorrhizal fungi (epsilon 13C +/- 1 SD of 7.2 +/-
   1.6 parts per thousand and epsilon 15N +/- 1 SD of 12.8 +/- 3.9 parts
   per thousand). These can be used to estimate the fungal contribution to
   organic nutrient uptake by partially mycoheterotrophic plants where
   fully mycoheterotrophic plants are lacking. N concentrations in orchid
   tissue were unusually high and significantly higher than in accompanying
   autotrophic leaf samples. This may be caused by N gain of E. aphyllum
   from obligate ectomycorrhizal fungi. We show that E. aphyllum is an
   epiparasitic mycoheterotrophic orchid that depends on ectomycorrhizal
   Inocybe and Hebeloma to obtain C and N through a tripartite system

Abstract = {{A large remaining of dry deciduous forest (woody Caatinga) in semi-arid
   Brazil has been reached by successive fires and exploratory actions what
   leads to the invasion of low load trees and shrub mesh, called
   ``Carrasco vegetation{''}. As it restrains the sprouting of woody
   species, land recuperation was performed using a mixed plantation of
   native and Eucalyptus species to both preservation and to supply the
   demand for wood. In order to evaluate the recuperation, a study of
   microbial communities was proposed. In addition to the highest soil
   phosphorus content found in the Carrasco area, the greatest spore
   density of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities occurred in
   the rhizosphere of the both pioneer species: Carrasco and Eucalyptus. In
   contrast to the DGGE bacteria profile, it was possible to group AMF
   species of the preserved and experimental sites which were not clustered
   with Carrasco species through the DGGE of Glomales DNA and also by the
   principal component analysis (PCA) based on diversity index. Glomus and
   Acaulospora were the dominant genera at both the preserved site and
   Carrasco. Nevertheless, Gigaspora species were preferentially found in
   Dry Forest, while Scutellospora were absent. In contrast, Carrasco
   favoured the genus Scutellospora and the species Acaulospora
   scrobiculata. Our results allow one to conclude that vegetation type
   modifies the AMF communities, which may be used as good indicator of
   soil quality. Based on AMF communities as soil quality indicator, the
   mixed forest plantation appears to be underway towards the preserved
   site two years after transplantation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Microbial communities and their associated enzyme activities affect the
   amount and chemical quality of carbon (C) in soils. Increasing nitrogen
   (N) deposition, particularly in N-rich tropical forests, is likely to
   change the composition and behavior of microbial communities and feed
   back on ecosystem structure and function. This study presents a novel
   assessment of mechanistic links between microbial responses to N
   deposition and shifts in soil organic matter (SOM) quality and quantity.
   We used phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and microbial enzyme
   assays in soils to assess microbial community responses to long-term N
   additions in two distinct tropical rain forests. We used soil density
   fractionation and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to
   measure related changes in SOM pool sizes and chemical quality.
   Microbial biomass increased in response to N fertilization in both
   tropical forests and corresponded to declines in pools of low-density
   SOM. The chemical quality of this soil C pool reflected
   ecosystem-specific changes in microbial community composition. In the
   lower-elevation forest, there was an increase in gram-negative bacteria
   PLFA biomass, and there were significant losses of labile C chemical
   groups (O-alkyls). In contrast, the upper-elevation tropical forest had
   an increase in fungal PLFAs with N additions and declines in C groups
   associated with increased soil C storage (alkyls). The dynamics of
   microbial enzymatic activities with N addition provided a functional
   link between changes in microbial community structure and SOM chemistry.
   Ecosystem-specific changes in microbial community composition are likely
   to have far-reaching effects on soil carbon storage and cycling. This
   study indicates that microbial communities in N-rich tropical forests
   can be sensitive to added N, but we can expect significant variability
   in how ecosystem structure and function respond to N deposition among
   tropical forest types.}},

Abstract = {{Root turnover is fastest in the finest roots of the root system (first
   root order). Additionally, tissue chemistry varies among even the finest
   root orders and between white roots and older, pigmented roots. Yet the
   effects of pigmentation and order on root decomposition have rarely been
   examined. We separated the first four root orders (all,1 mm) of four
   temperate tree species into three classes: white first- and second-order
   roots; pigmented first- and second-order roots; and pigmented third-and
   fourth-order roots. Roots were enclosed in litterbags and buried under
   their own and under a common species canopy in a 34-year-old common
   garden in Poland. When comparing decomposition of different root orders
   over 36 months, pigmented third-and fourth-order roots with a higher C:N
   ratio decomposed more rapidly, losing 20-40\% of their mass, than
   pigmented first- and second-order roots, which lost no more than 20\%.
   When comparing decomposition of roots of different levels of
   pigmentation within the same root order over 14 months, pigmented
   (older) first- and second-order roots lost; 10\% of their mass, while
   white (younger) first- and second-order roots lost; 30\%. In contrast to
   root mass loss, root N content declined more rapidly in the first- and
   second-order roots than in third-and fourth-order roots. In higher-order
   roots, N increased in the first 10 months from; 110\% to nearly 150\% of
   initial N content, depending on species; by the end of the study N
   content had returned to initial levels. These findings suggest that, in
   plant communities where root mortality is primarily of pigmented first-
   and second-order roots, microbial decomposition may be slower than
   estimates derived from bulk fine-root litterbag experiments, which
   typically contain at least four root orders. Thus, a more mechanistic
   understanding of root decomposition and its contribution to ecosystem
   carbon and nutrient dynamics requires a fundamental shift in
   experimental methods that stratifies root samples for decomposition
   along more functionally based criteria such as root order and
   pigmentation, which parallel the markedly different longevities of these
   different root classes.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Climate changes will influence soil organisms both directly (warming)
   and indirectly (warming and elevated CO2) via changes in quantity and
   quality of plant-mediated soil C inputs. Elevated atmospheric CO2
   commonly stimulates flow of organic C into the soil system, increases
   root production and exudation, but decreases litter quality. There is
   little evidence that atmospheric CO2 enrichment will increase total soil
   organic matter content because greater C flow into soil stimulates the
   soil food web, often leading to equivalent increases in soil CO2 efflux.
   Effects of warming on C allocation belowground, on the other hand, will
   depend largely on the temperature optima of different plant species.
   Warming is likely to increase the rate of soil organic matter
   decomposition by stimulating soil heterotrophic respiration, although
   some degree of acclimatization to warming is likely. Mycorrhizal and
   N-2-fixing relationships are generally enhanced by CO2 enrichment, but
   effects of warming are highly variable. Data suggest that energy flow
   through fungal pathways may be enhanced relative to bacterial pathways
   by both warming and atmospheric CO2 enrichment. Whether the shift toward
   fungal domination of soils will increase soilborne fungal disease
   occurrence in the future is still an open question. Plant heat and
   drought tolerance, along with resistance to pathogens in warmer and
   wetter soils, may be achieved, to some unknown extent, by exploitation
   and management of beneficial soil organisms. Further study is needed to
   develop a more holistic understanding of the effects of climate change

Abstract = {{Introduction Important nutrients in forest soils such as nitrogen and

   Objectives Activities of enzymes such as phosphatases, proteases,
   cellulases, chitinases and laccase were shown in saprotrophic but also
   in ectomycorrhizal fungi and there is increasing evidence that these
   enzymes contribute not only to the functioning of the symbiosis but also
   to the mobilisation of nutrients. In the present review, we describe how
   enzyme secretion and localisation on fungal hyphae may be connected to
   the potential role in soil nutrient cycling.

Abstract = {{Understanding the impacts of plant community characteristics on soil
   carbon dioxide efflux (R) is a key prerequisite for accurate prediction
   of the future carbon (C) balance of terrestrial ecosystems under climate
   change. However, developing a mechanistic understanding of the
   determinants of R is complicated by the presence of multiple different
   sources of respiratory C within soil - such as soil microbes, plant
   roots and their mycorrhizal symbionts - each with their distinct
   dynamics and drivers. In this review, we synthesize relevant information
   from a wide spectrum of sources to evaluate the current state of
   knowledge about plant community effects on R, examine how this
   information is incorporated into global climate models, and highlight
   priorities for future research. Despite often large variation amongst
   studies and methods, several general trends emerge.
   Mechanisms whereby plants affect R may be grouped into effects on
   belowground C allocation, aboveground litter properties and
   microclimate. Within vegetation types, the amount of C diverted
   belowground, and hence R, may be controlled mainly by the rate of
   photosynthetic C uptake, while amongst vegetation types this should be
   more dependent upon the specific C allocation strategies of the plant
   life form. We make the case that plant community composition, rather
   than diversity, is usually the dominant control on R in natural systems.
   Individual species impacts on R may be largest where the species
   accounts for most of the biomass in the ecosystem, has very distinct
   traits to the rest of the community and/or modulates the occurrence of
   major natural disturbances. We show that climate vegetation models
   incorporate a number of pathways whereby plants can affect R, but that
   simplifications regarding allocation schemes and drivers of litter
   decomposition may limit model accuracy. We also suggest that under a
   warmer future climate, many plant communities may shift towards
   dominance by fast growing plants which produce large quantities of
   nutrient rich litter. Where this community shift occurs, it could drive
   an increase in R beyond that expected from direct climate impacts on
   soil microbial activity alone.
   We identify key gaps in knowledge and recommend them as priorities for
   future work. These include the patterns of photosynthate partitioning
   amongst belowground components, ecosystem level effects of individual
   plant traits, and the importance of trophic interactions and species
   invasions or extinctions for ecosystem processes. A final, overarching
   challenge is how to link these observations and drivers across
   spatio-temporal scales to predict regional or global changes in R over
   long time periods. A more unified approach to understanding R, which
   integrates information about plant traits and community dynamics, will
   be essential for better understanding, simulating and predicting
   patterns of R across terrestrial ecosystems and its role within the
   earth-climate system.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2011}},

Abstract = {{Increasing environmental concerns with forestry have led to mounting
   interest in mixedwood management as a possible strategy to achieve a
   diversity of ecological and productivity goals within the context of
   sustainable forest management. This review focuses on the effects of
   mixedwoods on biodiversity including understory plants, birds, soil
   fauna, and ectomycorrhizae (ECM). It examines stand-level species
   diversity and composition but particularly focuses on the regional scale
   (gamma diversity) by examining evidence for the occurrence of
   mixedwood-indicator species. The main conclusions are as follows: (i)
   The existence of different tree species in the canopy is associated with
   provision of a greater diversity of microhabitats allowing for the
   addition of understory plant species associated with each canopy
   species. However, there is little evidence for the existence of
   understory plant species uniquely associated with mixedwoods. (ii) Some
   bird species require or prefer the presence of different tree species
   within a landscape or within a stand. Mixed forest stands and landscapes
   are thus critical to support populations of these species. (iii) A few
   studies showed a positive effect of mixed stands or mixed litters on
   some groups of soil organisms, but high variability makes it difficult
   to draw firm conclusions about any potential benefits of mixedwoods for
   biodiversity of soil fauna. (iv) Some ECM taxa are associated with
   multiple hosts, and could thus benefit from availability of multiple
   possible host species found in mixed forest stands. Several studies
   confirmed that there was a greater abundance of multiple-host ECM taxa
   in mixedwoods.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Quantifying pathways and temporal dynamics of carbon (C) flux
   between plants and soil is critical to our understanding of the
   long-term fate of C stored in soils. The potential priming of old
   organic matter decomposition by fresh C input from plants means that the
   impact of environmental changes on the interactions between plant C
   allocation and soil C storage need to be better understood. We used
   forest girdling to investigate the partitioning of total soil CO2 efflux
   (R-S) into autotrophic (R-A) and heterotrophic (R-H) flux components and
   their interaction with litter decomposition.
   2. The reduction in R-S in girdled plots stabilized within two weeks at
   65\% of control plot values, indicating that R-S is dominated by R-H,
   and that only a small pool of available non-structural C remains in
   roots in late summer to sustain rhizosphere metabolic processes. R-A
   contributions declined from 35\% late in the growing season to about
   25\% in winter.
   3. Our results indicate that actual root respiration (R-R) and
   respiration by ectyomycorrhizas and other rhizospheric organisms (R-M)
   contribute c. 50\% each to R-A between September and early November.
   During winter, R-A remained significantly greater than zero despite
   frequent sub-zero air temperatures, with R-M being a dominant component
   of R-A during this period.
   4. Forest girdling significantly increased the age of C in soil-respired
   CO2, consistent with the removal of contemporary C derived from R-A.
   Partitioning of soil CO2 efflux on the basis of 14C results shows good
   agreement with the flux reduction observed between girdled and control
   plots.
   5. Litter bag incubations indicate a promoting influence of an intact C
   supply to the rhizosphere on decomposition, indicating a positive
   rhizosphere priming effect.
   6. Synthesis: Our results demonstrate significant contribution of
   mycorrhizas and other rhizosphere organisms to R-S, and suggest a direct
   link between an intact rhizosphere and litter decomposition dynamics.
   These results highlight the tight coupling between autotroph activity
   and soil decomposition processes in forest soils, and add to the growing
   body of evidence that plant and soil processes cannot be treated
   separately.}},

Journal = {{NEW PHYTOLOGIST}},

Volume = {{191}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{508-514}},
Abstract = {{In many forest ecosystems, fine root litter comprises a large pool of
   organic carbon and nutrients. In temperate climates ectomycorrhizal
   fungi colonize the roots of many forest plant species. If
   ectomycorrhizal colonization influenced root decomposition, it could
   significantly influence carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling.
   Fungal tissues and fine roots may decompose at different rates and,
   therefore, ectomycorrhizal colonization may either hasten or retard root
   decomposition. Unfortunately, no comparisons of the decomposition of
   roots and ectomycorrhizal fungi have yet been made. Therefore, we
   compared decomposition of Pinus resinosa fine roots and ectomycorrhizal
   fungi from a Pinus resinosa plantation. We also compared the
   decomposition rates of nonmycorrhizal Pinus resinosa fine roots with
   roots colonized by nine species of ectomycorrhizal fungi.
   We found that the several tested isolates of ectomycorrhizal fungi
   decomposed far more rapidly than the fine roots and that ectomycorrhizal
   colonization either had no significant effect on root decomposition or
   significantly increased root decomposition depending on the isolate of
   fungus.
   We conclude that the composition of an ectomycorrhizal fungal community
   may affect carbon and nutrient cycling through its influence on root
   decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{Proper estimates of decomposition are essential for tropical forests,
   given their key role in the global carbon (C) cycle. However, the
   current paradigm for litter decomposition is insufficient to account for
   recent observations and may limit model predictions for highly diverse
   tropical ecosystems. In light of recent findings from a nutrient-poor
   Amazonian rainforest, we revisit the commonly held views that: litter
   traits are a mere legacy of live leaf traits; nitrogen (N) and lignin
   are the key litter traits controlling decomposition; and favourable
   climatic conditions result in rapid decomposition in tropical forests.
   Substantial interspecific variation in litter phosphorus (P) was found
   to be unrelated to variation in green leaves. Litter nutrients explained
   no variation in decomposition, which instead was controlled primarily by
   nonlignin litter C compounds at low concentrations with important soil
   fauna effects. Despite near-optimal climatic conditions, tropical litter
   decomposition proceeded more slowly than in a climatically less
   favourable temperate forest. We suggest that slow decomposition in the
   studied rainforest results from a syndrome of poor litter C quality
   beyond a simple lignin control, enforcing energy starvation of
   decomposers. We hypothesize that the litter trait syndrome in
   nutrient-poor tropical rainforests may have evolved to increase plant
   access to limiting nutrients via mycorrhizal associations.}},

Abstract = {{This review critically examines the role of boron (B) in forests in view
   of recent findings on B nutrition and the continuing occurrence of B
   deficiency. Many perceptions about the role of B in plants and its
   uptake and mobility have been altered since the last review on B in
   forest trees in 1990. Now there is evidence for a fundamental role of B
   in the formation of the pectic structure in primary cell walls in
   plants, and further roles in membrane function are being explored. In
   plants, channel-mediated B uptake, active B uptake and B uptake by
   mycorrhizas have been shown, B transporters have been identified, and B
   retranslocation has been shown. We explore these findings and their
   consequences on forest trees and on ecosystems that they dominate.
   Particular emphasis is placed on B retranslocation and B in mycorrhizal
   symbiosis, given their importance in trees.
   Following from impaired development of the primary cell wall in
   B-deficient trees, disorders in the structural development of organs and
   whole plants are manifested. This has consequences for tree form,
   affecting wood quality and productivity. At a stand level, at least part
   of the value of wood production is lost by the time the deficiency
   symptoms appear. As symptoms identifying deficiency in many tree species
   are too easily confused with many other effects, greater use should be
   made of foliar analysis but this requires establishing robust prognostic
   values for the trees of interest. There is still no explanation as to
   why root tip and mycorrhiza development are among the first phenomena to
   be affected as the B supply decreases. Whether B is required by, or
   whether it is useful for fungi, is still an open question.
   Boron remobilisation within trees may be a key factor in the occurrence
   of forests in areas with very low B availability, as most of the B in
   the whole stand can be in the standing biomass. The ability to
   remobilise B varies considerably between species, but we suggest that
   there is a continuum rather than a strict division to B-retranslocating
   and non-retranslocating species. Boron output from forest ecosystems
   with potential for leaching is controlled by adsorption in the soil,
   which is still poorly understood particularly in soils with abundant
   organic matter. Increased concentrations of phenolic compounds in
   B-deficient plants and possibly altered lignin concentration can affect
   plant defence systems to herbivory and pathogens, and nutrient and
   carbon release through decomposition. Hence, B nutrition and
   fertilisation of low-B stands can have implications both to the
   resistance of trees to biotic stress, as well as influence the cycles of
   other nutrients and carbon in forests. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This was a study of vegetation and soil properties in tree-fall gaps in

   (1) to determine if there are correlations between above-ground

   gaps, (2) to determine how large gaps influence forest soils compared
   with non-gap soils, and (3) to measure the effects of differently sized

   were created in old-growth Douglas-fir forests of the H. J. Andrews
   Experimental Forest in the western Oregon Cascade Mountains. To address
   the first objective, within-gap soil spatial patterns were compared with
   above ground distributions of both vegetation and large woody debris in
   two large gaps. Spatial and Pearson correlation analyses showed no
   consistent correlations between soil characteristics and above ground
   vegetation and coarse woody debris. With reference to the second
   objective, statistically significant differences between gal) and
   non-gap soil characteristics were observed. Soil moisture, temperature
   and denitrification potentials were all elevated in forest 50 m diameter
   gaps and litter depth, labile C, soil respiration, beta-gluosidase
   activity, and ectomytcorrhizal mat concentrations were all reduced.
   Comparisons between north and south gap soils, showed significant
   differences in soil characteristics in one but not the other 50 m gap.
   The third objective was addressed by documenting gap size effects on
   differences between gap and non gal) soil characteristics in two gaps
   each of 10, 20, 30, and 50 m diameter. Differences between gap and
   nongap soil moisture, litter depth and ectomycorrhizal mat coverages

   The ecological role and potential biotechnological applications of 300
   isolates of Basidiomycetes were assessed, taking into account the
   degradation of model dyes in different culture conditions and the
   production of oxidoreductase enzymes. The tested isolates belong to
   different ecophysiological groups (wood-degrading, litter-degrading,
   ectomycorrhizal, and coprophilous fungi) and represent a broad
   systematic and functional biodiversity among Basidiomycetes occurring in
   deciduous and evergreen forests of northwest Italy (Piedmont Region).
   The high number of species tested and the use of different culture
   conditions allowed the investigation of the degradation activity of
   several novel species, neglected to date. Oxidative enzyme activities
   varied widely among all ecophysiological groups and laccases were the
   most commonly detected enzymes. A large number of isolates (86\%),
   belonging to all ecophysiological groups, were found to be active
   against at least one model dye; the wood-degrading fungi represented the
   most efficient group. Noteworthily, also some isolates of
   litter-degrading and ectomycorrhizal fungi achieved good decolorization
   yield. The 25 best isolates were then tested against nine industrial

Abstract = {{Losses of species and changes in the composition of plant communities
   are likely to influence numerous ecosystem functions. Changes in the
   plant-soil interactions that control decomposition, in particular, could
   alter carbon and nutrient cycling in soils and further alter other
   ecosystem functions. The effects of plant communities on decomposition
   may depend both on the type of tissue being decomposed and also on the
   different stages of the decomposition process. We used an experimental
   design where single plant functional groups were removed from a northern
   grassland to examine the role of plant identity in determining both
   short-term and long-term above- and belowground decomposition rates.
   Plant removals were conducted across fertilization and fungicide
   treatments to examine environmental context-dependency of functional
   group identity effects on decomposition. There were significant effects
   of plant functional group identity on aboveground decomposition, with
   the loss of grasses and forbs slowing decomposition, whereas the effects
   on belowground decomposition were rare and transient. Effects of plant
   identity on decomposition were consistent in both short- and long-term
   decomposition studies indicating that the influences of identity on the
   decomposition environment remained consistent throughout the different
   stages of the decomposition process. Both fertilizer and fungicide
   treatments affected overall decomposition rate, but there were few
   interactions between these treatments and plant removals. Although
   current species loss is likely to be happening in concert with
   environmental changes, the role a species plays in determining ecosystem
   functions such as decomposition may not be context-dependent in these
   northern environments, and this may provide greater predictive power in
   determining the effects of species loss with changing environments.
   Further, as plant identity shows significant effects on litter
   decomposition rates, the effects of current and predicted future
   biodiversity losses may depend specifically on which species are lost.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria and fungi drive the cycling of plant litter in forests, but
   little is known about their role in tropical rain forest nutrient
   cycling, despite the high rates of litter decay observed in these
   ecosystems. However, litter decay rates are not uniform across tropical
   rain forests. For example, decomposition can differ dramatically over
   small spatial scales between low-diversity, monodominant rain forests,
   and species-rich, mixed forests. Because the climatic patterns and soil
   parent material are identical in co-occurring mixed and monodominant
   forests, differences in forest floor accumulation, litter production,
   and decomposition between these forests may be biotically mediated. To
   test this hypothesis, we conducted field and laboratory studies in a
   monodominant rain forest in which the ectomycorrhizal tree Dicymbe
   corymbosa forms > 80\% of the canopy, and a diverse, mixed forest
   dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. After 2 years, decomposition
   was significantly slower in the monodominant forest (P < 0.001), but
   litter production was significantly greater in the mixed forest (P <
   0.001). In the laboratory, we found microbial community biomass was
   greater in the mixed forest (P = 0.02), and the composition of fungal
   communities was distinct between the two rain forest types (P = 0.001).
   Sequencing of fungal rDNA revealed a significantly lower richness of
   saprotrophic fungi in the monodominant forest (19 species) relative to
   the species-rich forest (84 species); moreover, only 4\% percent of
   fungal sequences occurred in both forests. These results show that
   nutrient cycling patterns in tropical forests can vary dramatically over
   small spatial scales, and that changes in microbial community structure
   likely drive the observed differences in decomposition.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1139-1151}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Clearcut logging results in major changes in ectomycorrhizal fungal
   communities, but whether this results in the loss of key functional
   traits, such as those associated with nutrient acquisition from soil
   organic matter, is unknown. Furthermore, little is known about the
   importance of resource partitioning in structuring ectomycorrhizal
   fungal communities following disturbance because most research on these
   communities has focussed on life history strategies. By studying
   functional traits, such as activities of enzymes involved in the
   catabolism of organic macromolecules in soil, we can determine whether a
   physiological potential for resource partitioning exists in pioneer
   ectomycorrhizal communities and whether severe disturbance affects these
   important ecosystem services.
   2. We used activities of key hydrolytic enzymes in the
   ectomycorrhizospheres of Douglas-fir seedlings regenerating at clearcut
   sites as a functional trait to test whether these differed from those at
   recent wildfire sites or control forests. We sampled the most abundant
   types of ectomycorrhizas from 16-month-old seedlings from sites exposed
   to (i) low or (ii) high severity wildfire, (iii) sites that had been
   clearcut logged in the same year as the fire and (iv) sites that
   contained control stands of mature Douglas-fir. We expected differences
   in activities among ectomycorrhizas sampled from different disturbance
   treatments and among those formed by different fungal species.
   3. In spite of large differences in soil chemistry, activities of acid
   phosphomonoesterase, N-acetylglucosaminidase and beta-glucosidase, when
   averaged among the ectomycorrhizas sampled per site, were not affected
   by disturbance agent. However, activities varied up to sixfold among
   mycorrhizospheres of different fungal species on the same seedling.
   Multivariate analysis also indicated some consistent differences in
   enzyme profiles among ectomycorrhizas formed by specific fungal species,
   independent of treatment.
   4. The finding that ectomycorrhizal fungal communities exposed to
   different disturbance agents are functionally similar with respect to
   the activities of three mycorrhizosphere enzymes supports the conclusion
   that complementarity exists among ectomycorrhizal fungi. The substantial
   physiological diversity among ectomycorrhizal fungi at the scale of an
   individual seedling's root tips, especially at control mature forests,
   indicates the potential for resource partitioning within the
   ectomycorrhizal community and access to a wider range of nutrient
   sources by each seedling.
   5. Functional similarity among ectomycorrhizal fungal communities across
   a disturbance severity gradient suggests that dry interior Douglas-fir
   forests are resilient to severe disturbances such as high severity
   wildfire and clearcutting with forest floor removal. Moreover, our
   results suggest that current harvesting practices emulate natural
   disturbances with respect to site-level mycorrhizosphere enzyme
   activity. The large variation in activity among fungal species, however,
   indicates that a substantial simplification of the fungal community
   through other perturbations, as expected with climate change, has the
   potential to affect ecosystem function.}},

Abstract = {{Soil CO2 efflux is a large component of total respiration in many
   ecosystems. It is important to understand the environmental controls on
   soil CO2 efflux, in order to evaluate potential responses of ecosystems
   to climate change. This study investigated the relationship between
   total soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature, soil moisture and solar
   radiation on an interannual basis for a plot of temperate deciduous
   ancient semi-natural woodland at Wytham Woods in central southern
   England. We also aimed to quantify the contribution of soil organic
   matter decomposition (SOM), root-and-rhizosphere respiration, and
   mycorrhizal respiration components to total soil CO2 efflux, and
   determine their environmental correlates. Total soil CO2 efflux was
   measured regularly from April 2006 to December 2008 and found to average
   4.1 MgC ha(-)1 yr(-1) in both 2007 and 2008. In addition, we applied a
   recently developed approach to partition the efflux into SOM,
   root-and-rhizosphere, and mycorrhizal components in situ using mesh
   bags. SOM decomposition, root-and-rhizosphere, and mycorrhizal
   respiration were estimated to contribute 70 +/- 6\%, 22 +/- 6\% and 8
   3\% of total soil CO2 efflux respectively. equating to 3.0 +/- 0.3, 0.9
   +/- 0.2 and 0.3 +/- 0.1 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). In order to avoid the effect
   of temporal correlation between variables caused by seasonality, we
   investigated interannual variability by examining the relationship
   between CO2 flux anomalies and anomalies in environmental variables.
   Variation in soil temperature explained 50\% of the interannual variance
   in soil CO2 efflux, and soil moisture a further 18\% of the residual
   variance. Solar radiation, as a proxy for plant photosynthesis, had no
   significant effect on total soil CO2 efflux, but was positively
   correlated with root-and-rhizosphere respiration, and mycorrhizal
   respiration. The relationship between anomalies in soil CO2 efflux and
   soil temperature was highly significant, with a sensitivity of 0.164 +/-
   0.023 pmol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)degrees C-1. For mean peak summer efflux rates
   (2.03 mu mol CO2 m(2) s(-1)), this is equivalent to 8\% per degrees C,
   or a Q(10) temperature sensitivity of 2.2 +/- 0.2. We demonstrate the
   utility of an anomaly analysis approach and conclude that soil
   temperature is the key driver of total soil CO2 efflux primarily through
   its positive relationship with SOM-decomposition rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Boreal forests store a large fraction of global terrestrial carbon and
   are susceptible to environmental change, particularly rising
   temperatures and increased fire frequency. These changes have the
   potential to drive positive feedbacks between climate warming and the
   boreal carbon cycle. Because few studies have examined the warming
   response of boreal ecosystems recovering from fire, we established a
   greenhouse warming experiment near Delta Junction, Alaska, seven years
   after a 1999 wildfire. We hypothesized that experimental warming would
   increase soil CO2 efflux, stimulate nutrient mineralization, and alter
   the composition and function of soil fungal communities. Although our
   treatment resulted in 1.20 degrees C soil warming, we found little
   support for our hypothesis. Only the activities of cellulose- and
   chitin-degrading enzymes increased significantly by 15\% and 35\%,
   respectively, and there were no changes in soil fungal communities.
   Warming resulted in drier soils, but the corresponding change in soil
   water potential was probably not sufficient to limit microbial activity.
   Rather, the warming response of this soil may be constrained by
   depletion of labile carbon substrates resulting from combustion and
   elevated soil temperatures in the years after the 1999 fire. We conclude
   that positive feedbacks between warming and the microbial release of
   soil carbon are weak in boreal ecosystems lacking permafrost. Since
   permafrost-free soils underlie 45-60\% of the boreal zone, our results
   should be useful for modeling the warming response during recovery from
   fire in a large fraction of the boreal forest. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Soils emit a large variety of volatile organic compounds. In natural

   exchange rates between soil and atmosphere are difficult due to e.g. the

   potential sources for the same compounds. We measured in laboratory
   conditions the MVOC emission rates and spectra of eight typical fungi
   occurring in boreal forest soils. The studied species are decomposers
   (Gymnopilus penetrans, Ophiostoma abietinum), ectomycorrhizal
   (Cenococcum geophilum, Piloderma olivaceum, Suillus variegatus,
   Tomentellopsis submollis) and endophytic fungi (Meliniomyces variabilis,
   Phialocephala fortinii). The MVOC emissions contained altogether 21
   known and 6 unidentified compounds whose emission rates were >0.1 mu g

   Terpenoid emissions (isoprene, mono- and sesquiterpenes) were detected

Abstract = {{Three different approaches were used to calculate heterotrophic soil
   respiration (Rh) and soil carbon dynamics in an old-growth deciduous
   forest in central Germany. A root and mycorrhiza exclosure experiment in
   the field separated auto- and heterotrophic soil respiration. It was
   compared to modeled heterotrophic respiration resulting from two
   different approaches: a modular component model of soil respiration
   calculated autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration with litter,
   climate and canopy photosynthesis as input variables. It was calibrated
   by independent soil respiration measurements in the field. A second
   model was calibrated by incubation of soil samples from different soil
   layers in the laboratory. In this case, the annual sum of Rh was
   calculated by an empirical model including response curves to
   temperature and a soil moisture. The three approaches showed good
   accordance during spring and summer and when the annual sums of Rh
   calculated by the two models were compared. Average Rh for the years
   2002-2006 were 436 g C m(-2) year(-1) (field model) and 417 g C m(-2)
   year(-1) (lab-model), respectively. Differences between the approaches
   revealed specific limitations of each method. The average carbon balance
   of the Hainich forest soil was estimated to be between 1 and 35 g C
   m(-2) year(-1) depending on the model used and the averaging period. A
   comparison with nighttime data from eddy covariance (EC) showed that EC
   data were lower than modelled soil respiration in many situations. We
   conclude that better filter methods for EC nighttime data have to be
   developed.}},

   kBq/m(2) (calculated for October 2006). The majority of this activity
   was in the first 6 cm. Fruitbodies were analyzed for radiocesium and

   54.1 +/- 0.7 kBq/kg (dry weight) for a sample of Lactarius helvus

   the differences in the depth of the mycelium localization in a

Abstract = {{We used 454 sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region to
   characterize fungal communities in tallgrass prairie soils subdivided
   into strata 0-10, 10-20, 30-40 and 50-60 cm deep. The dataset included
   more than 14 000 fungal sequences distributed across Basidiomycota,
   Ascomycota, basal fungal lineages and Glomeromycota in order of
   decreasing frequency. As expected the community richness and diversity
   estimators tended to decrease with increasing depth. Although species
   richness was significantly reduced for samples from the deeper profiles,
   even the deepest stratum sampled contained richness of more than a third
   of that in the topmost stratum. More importantly, nonparametric
   multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination analyses indicated that the
   fungal communities differed across vertical profiles, although only the
   topmost and deepest strata were significantly different when the NMS
   axis scores were compared by ANOVA. These results emphasize the
   importance of considering the fungal communities across the vertical
   strata because the deeper soil horizons might maintain a distinct
   community composition and thus contribute greatly to overall richness.
   The majority of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) declined in frequency
   with increasing depth, although a linear regression analysis indicated
   that some increased with increasing depth. The OTUs and BLAST-assigned
   taxa that showed increasing frequencies were mainly unculturable fungi,
   but some showed likely affinities to families Nectriaceae and
   Venturiaceae or to genus Pachnocybe. Although the ecological roles of
   the fungi in the deeper strata remain uncertain, we hypothesize that the
   fungi with preferences for deeper soil have adequate access to

Abstract = {{We investigated the link between aboveground and belowground diversity
   in temperate deciduous forest ecosystems. To this end, we determined the
   effects of the tree species composition on the biomass and composition
   of the soil microbial community using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA)
   profiles in the Hainich National Park, a deciduous mixed forest on loess
   over limestone in Central-Germany. We investigated the effects of the
   leaf litter composition on the microbial community, hypothesizing that
   distinctive leaf litter compositions increase signature PLFAs. In
   addition, we studied the impact of clay content, pH and nutrient status
   of the soil on the microbial community in different surface soil layers.
   Consequently, soil was sampled from depths of 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm and 10-20
   cm. Plots with highest leaf litter diversity had the largest total
   amounts of fatty acids, but only PLFA 16:1 omega 5, which is a common
   marker for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, was significantly increased. In
   the uppermost soil layer, the pH explained most of the variance in
   microbial composition. In the deeper surface soil layers, nutrients such
   as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus determined the microbial abundances
   and composition. Our results suggest that the soil microbial community
   is mainly indirectly influenced by aboveground diversity. Changes in
   soil pH or the soil nutrient status that are driven by specific plant
   traits like leave litter quality drive these indirect changes. Specific
   direct interactions are most reasonable for mycorrhizal fungi. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Dense hyphal mats formed by ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi are prominent
   features in Douglas-fir forest ecosystems, and have been estimated to
   cover up to 40\% of the soil surface in some forest stands. Two
   morphotypes of EcM mats have been previously described: rhizomorphic
   mats, which have thick hyphal rhizomorphs and are found primarily in the
   organic horizon, and hydrophobic mats, which occur in the mineral
   horizon and have an ashy appearance. This study surveyed EcM mat and
   non-mat soils from eight early and late seral conifer forest stands at
   the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in western Oregon. EcM mats were
   classified by morphology and taxonomic identities were determined by DNA
   sequencing. A variety of chemical and biochemical properties, including
   enzymes involved in C, N, and P cycling were measured. Analysis was
   confined to a comparison of rhizomorphic mats colonizing the organic
   horizon with non-mat organic soils, and hydrophobic mats with non-mat
   mineral soils. Both the organic and mineral horizons showed differences
   between mat and non-mat enzyme profiles when compared on a dry weight
   basis. In the organic horizon, rhizomorphic mats had greater chitinase
   activity than non-mat soils: and in the mineral horizon, hydrophobic
   mats had increased chitinase, phosphatase, and phenoloxidase activity
   compared to the non-mat soil. The rhizomorphic mats had 2.7 times more
   oxalate than the non-mats and significantly lower pH. In the mineral
   horizon, hydrophobic mats had 40 times more oxalate and significantly
   lower pH than non-mat mineral soils. Microbial biomass C was not
   significantly different between the rhizomorphic mat and non-mat organic
   soils. In the mineral horizon, however, the hydrophobic mats had greater
   microbial biomass C than the non-mat soils. These data demonstrate that
   soils densely colonized by EcM fungi create a unique soil environment
   with distinct microbial activities when compared to non-mat forest
   soils. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Mangrove forests dominate the world's tropical and subtropical
   coastlines. Similar to other plant communities, nutrient availability is
   one of the major factors influencing mangrove forest structure and
   productivity. Many mangrove soils have extremely low nutrient
   availability, although nutrient availability can vary greatly among and
   within mangrove forests. Nutrient-conserving processes in mangroves are
   well developed and include evergreeness, resorption of nutrients prior
   to leaf fall, the immobilization of nutrients in leaf litter during
   decomposition, high root/shoot ratios and the repeated use of old root
   channels. Both nitrogen-use efficiency and nutrient resorption
   efficiencies in mangroves are amongst the highest recorded for
   angiosperms. A complex range of interacting abiotic and biotic factors
   controls the availability of nutrients to mangrove trees, and mangroves
   are characteristically plastic in their ability to opportunistically
   utilize nutrients when these become available. Nitrogen and phosphorus
   have been implicated as the nutrients most likely to limit growth in
   mangroves. Ammonium is the primary form of nitrogen in mangrove soils,
   in part as a result of anoxic soil conditions, and tree growth is
   supported mainly by ammonium uptake. Nutrient enrichment is a major
   threat to marine ecosystems. Although mangroves have been proposed to
   protect the marine environment from land-derived nutrient pollution,
   nutrient enrichment can have negative consequences for mangrove forests
   and their capacity for retention of nutrients may be limited.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions among different components of detrital food webs are
   likely to influence carbon processing and linkages between C and
   nutrient cycling. Our objective was to identify potentially important
   interactions in detrital food webs at the Hubbard Brook Experimental
   Forest, NH, USA, by exploring relationships among C resources, microbial
   biomass, microarthropod abundance and nitrogen availability as they vary
   across the landscape. We found significant spatial variation in
   microarthropod abundance in the forest floor across elevation zones in
   two watersheds, with consistently higher abundance in low-elevation
   hardwoods and upper conifer zones and lower abundance in mid- and
   high-elevation hardwoods. The same pattern was observed in the Oe
   horizon for microbial biomass C and respiration but not for N
   transformations; however, no patterns were observed in the Oa horizon.
   Microarthropod abundance and microbial biomass C were significantly
   positively correlated, but neither were related to forest floor mass or
   to annual aboveground fine litterfall flux. Instead, a positive
   correlation with fine root biomass suggests that C supply from roots
   plays a key role in the fungal channel of the detrital food web of these
   forests. The lack of relationship between patterns of microarthropod
   abundance and net N mineralization leads us to hypothesize that spatial
   patterns of nitrogen availability are not closely linked to variation in
   carbon flow through the detrital food web, within this forested
   landscape. In contrast, microarthropod abundance and net N
   mineralization did exhibit similar interannual variation and may respond
   to the same temporal controls. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15)
   have been used for more than two decades in analyses of food web
   structure. The utility of isotope ratio measurements is based on the
   observation that consumer delta C-13 values are similar (< 1aEuro
   degrees difference) to those of their diet, while consumer delta N-15
   values are about 3aEuro degrees higher than those of their diet. The
   technique has been applied most often to aquatic and aboveground
   terrestrial food webs. However, few isotope studies have examined
   terrestrial food web structure that includes both above- and belowground
   (detrital) components. Here, we review factors that may influence
   isotopic signatures of terrestrial consumers in above- and belowground
   systems. In particular, we emphasize variations in delta C-13 and delta
   N-15 in belowground systems, e.g., enrichment of C-13 and N-15 in soil
   organic matter (likely related to soil microbial metabolism). These
   enrichments should be associated with the high C-13 (similar to 3aEuro
   degrees) enrichment in belowground consumers relative to litter and soil
   organic matter and with the large variation in delta N-15 (similar to
   6aEuro degrees) of the consumers. Because such enrichment and variation
   are much greater than the trophic enrichment generally used to estimate
   consumer trophic positions, and because many general predators are
   considered dependent on energy and material flows from belowground, the
   isotopic variation in belowground systems should be taken into account
   in delta C-13 and delta N-15 analyses of terrestrial food webs.
   Meanwhile, by measuring the delta C-13 of key predators, the linkage
   between above- and belowground systems could be estimated based on
   observed differences in delta C-13 of primary producers, detritivores
   and predators. Furthermore, radiocarbon (C-14) measurements will allow
   the direct estimation of the dependence of predators on the belowground
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal fungi dominate the humus layers of boreal forests. They
   depend on carbohydrates that are translocated through roots, via fungal
   mycelium to microsites in the soil, wherein they forage for nutrients.
   Mycorrhizal fungi are therefore sensitive to disruptive disturbances
   that may restrict their carbon supply. By disrupting root connections,
   we induced a sudden decline in mycorrhizal mycelial abundance and
   studied the consequent effects on growth and activity of free living,
   saprotrophic fungi and bacteria in pine forest humus, using molecular
   community analyses in combination with enzyme activity measurements.
   Ectomycorrhizal fungi had decreased in abundance 14 days after root
   severing, but the abundance of certain free-living ascomycetes was three
   times higher within 5 days of the disturbance compared with undisturbed
   controls. Root disruption also increased laccase production by an order
   of magnitude and cellulase production by a factor of 5. In contrast,
   bacterial populations seemed little affected. The results indicate that
   access to an external carbon source enables mycorrhizal fungi to
   monopolise the humus, but disturbances may induce rapid growth of
   opportunistic saprotrophic fungi that presumably use the dying
   mycorrhizal mycelium. Studies of such functional shifts in fungal
   communities, induced by disturbance, may shed light on mechanisms behind
   nutrient retention and release in boreal forests. The results also
   highlight the fundamental problems associated with methods that study
   microbial processes in soil samples that have been isolated from living
   roots. The ISME Journal (2010) 4, 872-881; doi:10.1038/ismej.2010.19;

Abstract = {{Fine root (< 2 mm) decomposition provides a substantial amount of
   available nitrogen (N) that sustains plant growth. The N release pattern
   during litter decomposition is generally controlled by initial N
   concentrations or C/N. Because root branch order and mycorrhizal
   colonization (related with branch order) are both highly related with
   different initial chemistry, a hypothesis was proposed that N dynamics
   during root decomposition varied among different branch orders. Using
   the litterbag method, decomposition of the first six order roots for
   Fraxinus mandshurica (an arbuscular mycorrhizal species) and Larix
   gmelinii (an ectomycorrhizal species) was studied in Northeast China
   during a 513-day period. Results showed a similar pattern for the two
   species with contrasting mycorrhizal type: lower-order roots (the
   lateral root tips), which had an initial C/N of 17-21, continuously
   released N without any immobilization and maintained a consistently low
   C/N (< 20), whereas higher-order roots, which had an initial C/N of
   28-48, periodically immobilized N, leading to a declining C/N over time.
   In addition, the magnitude of N dynamics is different between species
   for lower-order roots, but no different for higher-order roots. These
   results suggest that fine root N dynamics are heterogeneous among branch
   orders and that species-specific differences depend on the behavior of
   lower-order roots.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of how forest management influences soil microbial community
   interactions is necessary for complete understanding of forest ecology.
   In this study, soil microbial communities, vegetation characteristics
   and soil physical and chemical properties were examined across a
   rectangular 4.57 x 36.58 m sample grid spanning adjacent coniferous
   forest and clearcut areas. Based on analysis of soil extracted
   phospholipid fatty acids, total microbial biomass, fungi and
   Gram-negative bacteria were found to be significantly reduced in soil of
   the clearcut area relative to the forest. Concurrent with changes in
   microbial communities, soil macroaggregate stability was reduced in the
   clearcut area, while no significant differences in soil pH and organic
   matter content were found. Variography indicated that the range at which
   spatial autocorrelation between samples was evident (patch size) was
   greater for all microbial groups analyzed in the clearcut area. Overall,
   less spatial structure could be resolved in the forest. Variance
   decomposition using principal coordinates of neighbor matrices spatial
   variables indicated that soil aggregate stability and vegetation
   characteristics accounted for significant microbial community spatial
   variation in analyses that included the entire plot. When clearcut and
   forest areas were analyzed separately, different environmental variables
   (pH in the forest area and soil organic matter in the clearcut) were
   found to account for variation in soil microbial communities, but little
   of this variation could be ascribed to spatial interactions. Most
   microbial variation explained by different components of microbial
   communities occurred at spatial scales other than those analyzed. Fungi
   accounted for over 50\% of the variation in bacteria of the forest area
   but less than 11\% in the clearcut. Conversely, AMF accounted for
   significant variation in clearcut area, but not forest, bacteria. These
   results indicate broadly disparate controls on soil microbial community
   composition in the two systems. We present multiple lines of evidence
   pointing toward shifts in fungi functional groups as a salient mechanism
   responsible for qualitative, quantitative and spatial distribution

Abstract = {{Pyrosequencing, a non-electrophoretic method of DNA sequencing, was used

   carried out on amplicons derived from the 5' region of 18S rDNA. A total
   of 10,166 reads were obtained, with an average length of 103 bp. The
   maximum number of fungal phylotypes in soil predicted at 99\% similarity
   was 3,334. The maximum numbers of phylotypes predicted at 97\% and 95\%
   similarities were 736 and 286, respectively. Through phylogenetic

Abstract = {{Among tree fine roots, the distal small-diameter lateral branches
   comprising first- and second-order roots lack secondary (wood)
   development. Therefore, these roots are expected to decompose more
   rapidly than higher order woody roots. But this prediction has not been
   tested and may not be correct. Current evidence suggests that lower
   order roots may decompose more slowly than higher order roots in tree
   species associated with ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi because they are
   preferentially colonized by fungi and encased by a fungal sheath rich in
   chitin (a recalcitrant compound). In trees associated with arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, lower order roots do not form fungal sheaths,
   but they may have poorer C quality, e.g. lower concentrations of soluble
   carbohydrates and higher concentrations of acid-insolubles than higher
   order roots, thus may decompose more slowly. In addition, litter with
   high concentrations of acid insolubles decomposes more slowly under
   higher N concentrations (such as lower order roots). Therefore, we
   propose that in both AM and EM trees, lower order roots decompose more
   slowly than higher order roots due to the combination of poor C quality
   and high N concentrations. To test this hypothesis, we examined
   decomposition of the first six root orders in Fraxinus mandshurica (an
   AM species) and Larix gmelinii (an EM species) using litterbag method in
   northeastern China. We found that lower order roots of both species
   decomposed more slowly than higher order roots, and this pattern appears
   to be associated mainly with initial C quality and N concentrations.
   Because these lower order roots have short life spans and thus dominate
   root mortality, their slow decomposition implies that a substantial
   fraction of the stable soil organic matter pool is derived from these
   lower order roots, at least in the two species we studied.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of the biodiversity of wild macrofungi, including edible
   species yields, was carried out from 1 May to 30 September 2007 at four
   different forest types (in mainly Miang tea forest). The plots 100 m(2),
   comprised a tea garden with a few planted canopy tree species (37.2\%
   canopy cover), a cultivated sustainable tea forest (80.2\% canopy
   cover), an abandoned sustainable tea forest (89.8\% canopy cover), and
   an abandoned sustainable tea forest that had suffered fire damage
   (72.9\% canopy cover). All visible mushrooms were collected during
   weekly forays. Macro-characters of the fungi were annotated and
   photographed by digital camera and the fungi were identified to genera
   and morphospecies (e.g. Agaricus sp.1, Agaricus sp.2). The fresh weight
   of wild edible mushrooms produced in the plots was also recorded during
   this period. The biodiversity of macrofungi in abandoned sustainable tea
   forest was highest with 115 species in 47 genera, followed by cultivated
   sustainable tea forest with 85 species in 42 genera and fire damaged
   abandoned sustainable tea forest with 48 species in 25 genera, while
   only 19 species belonging to 15 genera were found in the tea garden.
   Twenty-one species belonging to nine genera with a total of 60.9 kg of
   edible fungi were collected throughout this study. The fresh weight of
   edible mushrooms was recorded with the highest fresh weight (25.3 kg)
   collected from the abandoned sustainable tea forest, followed by 18.2 kg
   in the cultivated sustainable tea forest, while in the fire damaged
   sustainable tea forest 16.4 kg were collected and only 1 kg was
   collected in the tea garden. Abandoned sustainable tea forest contained
   a greater shade tree biodiversity and higher canopy cover than other
   plots. This area has a generally higher humidity, a greater ground
   litter cover, a greater number of microhabitats, a greater number of
   trees that can form mycorrhizal associations and this probably accounts
   for the higher diversity of macrofungi and production of edible
   mushrooms. The fire damaged sustainable tea forest had lower mushroom
   diversity and edible mushroom production possibly due to the loss of
   litter and lower tree diversity. The tea garden supported a poor
   diversity of mushrooms and almost no edible mushrooms. Shade tea forest
   (Miang tea forest) is a good method to produce tea in a sustainable way
   as it maintains diversity of mushrooms and other organisms and could be
   developed as an alternative to shade coffee.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how abiotic conditions mediate the outcome of biotic
   interactions is a key question in community ecology. This is
   particularly interesting in the case of mutualisms because changing
   environmental conditions may be a source of evolutionary or ecological
   instability in the relationship between symbiotic partners. For the
   mycorrhizal symbiosis, elevated nutrient levels may make the carbon cost
   to plants of supporting mycorrhizal fungi outweigh the benefits of
   mycorrhizal nutrient acquisition. In this study, we simulated the
   effects of post-fire nutrient enrichment on the ectomycorrhizal
   symbiosis between Rhizopogon occidentalis and Pinus muricata by using
   factorial combinations of soil heating, ash addition and mycorrhizal
   colonization. In general, the presence of R. occidentalis and the heat
   and ash treatments increased growth of P. muricata seedlings. However,
   significant interactions between the treatments indicated that there
   were context-dependent effects on seedling growth. Soil heating
   increased soil mineral nitrogen content, but did not decrease the
   benefit of mycorrhizal colonization relative to unheated controls. This
   appeared to be driven by a decrease in the proportion of the root system
   occupied by R. occidentalis, indicating that host-plants can optimize
   colonization in a way that maximizes growth. Because seedlings in
   heat-treated soils were larger than unheated controls, reduced percent
   colonization did not cause any decrease in fungal biomass in
   heat-treated soils. Since there was no decrease in the performance of
   either partner, our results show that, in this system, ectomycorrhizal
   mutualisms are likely robust within the natural degree of environmental
   variability caused by moderate intensity wildfires.}},

   winter-deciduous oak species due to differences in leaf fall quality,
   was the most important variable for explaining ECM species distribution.
   The evaluation of alternative causal models by the d-sep method revealed
   that only those considering indirect leaf fall-mediated host effects
   statistically matched the observed covariation patterns between host,
   environment (litter, topsoil, subsoil) and fungal community variables.

Abstract = {{Soil nutrient environments are changing in forests of the northeastern
   United States due to decades of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) emissions and
   acidic deposition, causing N enrichment and cation depletion, and
   possibly alleviating N limitation to forest growth. We asked whether
   biotic demand for phosphorus (P) or calcium (Ca) exceeded that for N and
   used an ingrowth core approach to test belowground responses to
   different nutrients. We tested fine root foraging for nutrients (N, P,
   or Ca) in three mid-age (26-30 years) and mature (a parts per thousand
   yen100 years) northern hardwood forest stands in the Bartlett
   Experimental Forest (BEF), NH, and in one mature forest stand in the
   Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH, USA. Fine root
   colonization of cores responded clearly to Ca in mature forest at HBEF,
   responded to P in mid-age forests at BEF, and responded primarily to N
   in mature forests at BEF. Net N mineralization potential was higher in
   soils of mid-age than mature forests at BEF, with roots responding to N
   where N availability was low and to P or Ca where N availability was
   high. Nutrients elicited no responses from either fungi or phosphatase
   activity in mid-age forests, but in mature forests at BEF, N enhanced
   phosphatase activity. While no straightforward pattern emerged among the
   different mechanisms of nutrient acquisition that we tested, our results
   do suggest that P and Ca can be important limiting nutrients in these
   northern hardwood forests when N availability is relatively high. We
   hypothesize that the interacting effects of disturbance by forest
   harvest and N deposition can cause a transient P limitation to forest
   growth, and that other nutrients become more limiting as forests age.}},

Abstract = {{Plant and microbial use of nitrogen (N) can be simultaneously
   mutualistic and competitive, particularly in ecosystems dominated by
   mycorrhizal fungi. Our goal was to quantify plant uptake of organic and
   inorganic N across a broad latitudinal gradient of forest ecosystems
   that varied with respect to overstory taxon, edaphic characteristics,
   and dominant mycorrhizal association. Using C-13 and N-15, we observed
   in situ the cycling dynamics of NH4 (+) and glycine through various soil
   pools and fine roots over 14 days. Recovery of N-15 as soil N varied
   with respect to N form, forest type, and sampling period; however, there
   were similarities in the cycling dynamics of glycine and NH4 (+) among
   all forest types. Microbial immobilization of N-15 was immediately
   apparent for both treatments and represented the largest sink (similar
   to 25\%) for N-15 among extractable soil N pools during the first 24 h.
   In contrast, fine roots were a relatively small sink (< 10\%) for both N
   forms, but fine root C-13 enrichment indicated that plants in all forest
   types absorbed glycine intact, suggesting that plants and microbes
   effectively target the same labile soil N pools. Relative uptake of
   amino acid-N versus NH4 (+) varied significantly among sites and
   approximately half of this variation was explained by mycorrhizal
   association. Estimates of plant uptake of amino acid-N relative to NH4
   (+) were 3x higher in ectomycorrhizal-dominated stands (1.6 +/- A 0.2)
   than arbuscular mycorrhizae-dominated stands (0.5 +/- A 0.1). We
   conclude that free amino acids are an important component of the N
   economy in all stands studied; however, in these natural environments
   plant uptake of organic N relative to inorganic N is explained as much
   by mycorrhizal association as by the availability of N forms per se.}},

Abstract = {{Extracellular enzymes mediate the degradation, transformation and
   mineralization of soil organic matter. The activity of cellulases,
   phosphatases and other hydrolases has received extensive study and in
   many cases stoichiometric relationships and responses to disturbances
   are well established. In contrast, phenol oxidase and peroxidase
   activities, which are often uncorrelated with hydrolase activities, have
   been measured in only a small subset of soil enzyme studies. These
   enzymes are expressed for a variety of purposes including ontogeny,
   defense and the acquisition of carbon and nitrogen. Through excretion or
   lysis, these enzymes enter the environment where their aggegrate
   activity mediates key ecosystem functions of lignin degradation,
   humification, carbon mineralization and dissolved organic carbon export.
   Phenol oxidases and peroxidases are less stable in the environment than
   extracellular hydrolases, especially when associated with organic
   particles. Activities are also affected, positively and negatively, by
   interaction with mineral surfaces. High spatiotemporal variation
   obscures their relationships with environmental variables and ecological
   process. Across ecosystems, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities
   generally increase with soil pH, a finding not predicted from the pH
   optima of purified enzymes. Activities associated with plant litter and
   particulate organic matter often correlate with decomposition rates and
   potential activities generally increase with the lignin and secondary
   compound content of the material. At the ecosystem scale, nitrogen
   amendment alters the expression of phenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes
   more broadly than culture studies imply and these responses correlate
   with positive and negative changes in litter decomposition rates and
   soil organic matter content. At the global scale, N amendment of
   basidiomycete-dominated soils of temperate and boreal forest ecoystems
   often leads to losses of oxidative enzyme activity, while activities in
   grassland soils dominated by glomeromycota and ascomycetes show little
   net response. Land use that leads to loss of soil organic matter tends
   to increase oxidative activities. Across ecosystems, soil organic matter
   content is not correlated with mean potential phenol oxidase and
   peroxidase activities. A multiple regression model that includes soil
   pH, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and potential
   phenol oxidase activity accounts for 37\% of the variation in soil
   organic matter (SOM) content across ecosystems (n = 63); a similar model
   for peroxidase activity describes 32\% of SOM variance (n = 43).
   Analysis of residual variation suggest that suites of interacting
   factors create both positive and negative feedbacks on soil organic
   matter storage. Soils with high oxygen availability, pH and mineral
   activity tend to be substrate limited: high in situ oxidative activities
   limit soil organic matter accumulation. Soils with opposing
   characteristics are activity limited: low in situ oxidative activities
   promote soil organic matter storage. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The relative diversity and abundance of different functional groups of
   macrofungi were investigated in the northern jarrah forest, a
   mediterranean climate sclerophyllous forest dominated by eucalyptus
   trees in Western Australia. We sampled paired sites that were either
   severely affected by dieback, a disease caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi
   which causes selective plant mortality, or unaffected by this type of
   forest decline. Macrofungi were sampled 3 times during the growing
   season along six 100 m x 2 m transects in these sites.
   Dieback-unaffected sites were found to have significantly different
   macrofungal floras than unaffected sites. Macrofungal abundance and
   diversity were approximately 1.5 times and 1.8 times greater
   respectively in dieback-unaffected sites than in severely affected
   sites. Dieback-affected sites had a similar diversity of saprotrophic
   and ectomycorthizal fungi, whereas more fungal taxa on
   dieback-unaffected sites were mycorrhizal (>60\%). Dung fungi were the
   most common saprophytes, especially in dieback-affected sites, but
   abundance data greatly overestimated the importance of these relatively
   small fungi. We concluded that vegetation changes linked to dieback had
   a negative effect on fungal community structure and biodiversity in the
   northern jarrah forest, in a similar manner to other forms of severe
   disturbance. Conversely, high tree mortality increased the abundance of
   wood decay fungi, at least in the short term. We expect that reductions
   in macrofungal species richness were indirectly linked to impacts on
   mycorrhizal host plants and saprotrophic substrates. Our data show that
   changes in vegetation composition had the greatest effect on
   ectomycorrhizal fungi, presumably due to their obligate symbiotic

Abstract = {{This study aimed to determine the response of native plant species to
   changed growing conditions, especially increased shade, following
   establishment of exotic Pinus radiata plantation on cleared native
   eucalypt forest. in the Northern Hemisphere, species tolerant to shading
   are typically herbaceous perennials, with large seeds, no obvious
   mechanism of seed dispersal, and spread by clonal means. We investigated
   whether life form, mode of seed dispersal, leaf area, specific leaf area
   (SLA), nutrient uptake strategy, seed mass, fire response, plant height,
   and clonal spread differed between understorey species of pine
   plantation and native forest. Further, we asked whether plant functional
   traits that confer tolerance to stress through shading differ from those
   in other floras. The study was conducted on the Delatite Peninsula in
   north-eastern Victoria, Australia. Vegetation of adjacent native forest
   and pine plantation were surveyed using eight 7 m x 7 m plots per site,
   randomly located within five paired sites. Differences in plant traits
   between land-use types were tested by Non-metric Multi-dimensional
   Scaling (NMDS), analysis of similarity (ANOSIM)and paired t-tests.
   Cluster analysis of the nine plant traits was used to define emergent
   groups, with differences between land-use types examined by ANOSIM and
   indicator species analysis. There was a significant change in the
   composition of understorey vegetation following conversion to pine
   plantation that included a decline in the richness of native species.
   NMDS of plant attributes showed a clear separation of native forest from
   pine plantation with land use strongly correlated in ordination space
   (r(2) = 0.611). Cluster analysis produced seven emergent groups of plant
   functional traits for 78 identified plant species. Phanerophytes split
   into two groups (myrmecochorous trees and shrubs; myrmecochorous
   shrubs), perennial herbs into four groups (upright herbs, myrmecochorous
   herbs, barochorous herbs, flat rosette herbs) with one group
   representing therophytes and anemochorous perennials. Perennial herbs
   with intermediate SLA and clonal spread were tolerant of the shaded
   conditions in pine plantation while the two groups of phanerophytes and
   the myrmecochorous herbs were largely excluded. Shared traits of
   excluded emergent groups included those that provided an over-riding
   adaptation to mineral nutrient stress. including myrmecochory, low SLA,
   ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal associations and N-2-fixation.
   These plant traits could not provide tolerance to stress through
   shading, which is better explained by the open canopied nature of the
   native forest. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Liming is a forestry practice used to counteract forest decline in
   acidic soils. It consists of direct Ca and Mg input to forest soil,
   which restores tree mineral nutrition, but also modifies microbial
   communities in soil. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of
   liming on both belowground (ectomycorrhizal root tips) and aboveground
   (epigeous sporocarps) fungal communities.
   Results showed that the modification of soil chemical properties ( pH,
   and Ca-Mg contents versus total free Al and Fe concentrations) was a
   stronger factor of ECM community structuring than tree host. The species
   appearing in limed plots were ubiquist or known as good competitors and
   replaced acidophilic and stress species.
   At the sporocarp level, tree host was a stronger factor of community
   structuring than soil chemical properties associated with liming. On the
   whole, there was a shift in the community composition from a typical
   acidophilic forest fungal community of medium altitude in the untreated
   plots to a less typical one, with the reduced dominance of acidophilic
   fungi while many late-stage forest species appeared.
   We finally suggest a marker species (Russula ochroleuca) to assess both
   above and belowground effects of liming on ectomycorrhizal communities.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{The growth of Eucalyptus regnans F.Muell. (mountain ash) seedlings is
   poor in natural forest soil, where purple coloration of the foliage
   indicates P deficiency and where the fungus Cylindrocarpon destructans
   (Zinsm.) Scholten is commonly isolated from the roots of the seedlings.
   When forest soil is air-dried, P acquisiton and growth of seedlings are
   markedly improved, although the degree of growth stimulation varies
   considerably at different times, as does the frequency of occurrence of
   C. destructans on the roots. C. destructans has been implicated as a
   possible reason for suppressed growth of seedlings in undried natural
   soil. To find out whether C. destructans contributes to growth
   inhibition of E. regnans seedlings in undried forest soil, the effect of
   three isolates of C. destructans on the root growth of E. regnans
   seedlings was tested in Petri dish experiments in vitro and the effect
   of C. destructans inoculation on seedling growth both in air-dried and
   undried forest soil was tested in pot experiments. The frequency of
   occurrence of C. destructans on the roots varied at different times, and
   was not consistently higher in undried than in air-dried soil, even
   though the growth of the seedlings was always poor in undried soil
   compared with that in air-dried soil. In vitro, C. destructans decreased
   the root growth significantly and caused blackening of root tips. This
   effect was removed by adding natural air-dried or undried soil. In pot
   experiments using undried forest soil, there was no evidence of either
   direct toxic effect or any other adverse effect on the roots when soil
   was inoculated with this fungus, even when the growth of the seedlings
   was reduced to similar to 1/2 of that in uninoculated undried soil. In
   air-dried soil, inoculation with the fungus did not significantly reduce
   seedling growth. Although potentially pathogenic and able to cause
   blackening of root tips, C. destructans is unlikely to be the main
   reason for poor seedling growth in undried forest soil. It appears to be
   antagonistic rather than pathogenic, suppressing seedling growth only
   under unfavourable conditions, such as in undried soil, possibly by
   competing for limited nutrients, or by suppressing other beneficial
   micro-organisms. The results are discussed in the context of field
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand how management and restoration practices influence
   the response of terrestrial ecosystems to large-scale disturbances, it
   is critical to study above- and belowground effects. In this study, we
   examined the immediate effect of a major hurricane on aboveground forest
   structure, arbuscular mycorrhizae ( AM) and belowground carbon pools in
   experimentally thinned plots in a tropical forest. The hurricane
   occurred five years after a thinning treatment, when thinned plots had
   similar aboveground carbon stocks but different forest structure
   compared to control plots. Thinned plots had more large diameter (>10
   cm) trees compared to the control plots, which were characterized by a
   higher density of small diameter (<10 cm) trees. Despite pre-hurricane
   differences in forest structure, there were no significant differences
   between treatments in changes of canopy openness or number of affected
   trees following the hurricane. Thinned plots had larger belowground
   carbon pools than the controls plots before the hurricane, and these
   differences remained after the hurricane despite rapid decomposition of
   organic matter rich in nitrogen. There were no pre-hurricane differences
   in AM fungal spores or total AM root colonization. The hurricane reduced
   AM sporulation by nearly 50\% in both treatments, yet we observed a
   significant increase in AM root colonization after the hurricane with
   greater AM colonization in the thinned plots. Hurricanes have well-known
   visible aboveground effects, but here we showed that less visible
   belowground effects are influenced by forest management and may play an

Abstract = {{P>Plant seasonal cycles alter carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) availability
   for soil microbes, which may affect microbial community composition and

   Here, we experimentally manipulated the C and N availability in a beech
   forest through N fertilization or tree girdling and conducted a detailed
   analysis of the seasonal pattern of microbial community composition and
   decomposition processes over 2 yr.
   We found a strong relationship between microbial community composition
   and enzyme activities over the seasonal course. Phenoloxidase and
   peroxidase activities were highest during late summer, whereas cellulase
   and protease peaked in late autumn. Girdling, and thus loss of
   mycorrhiza, resulted in an increase in soil organic matter-degrading
   enzymes and a decrease in cellulase and protease activity.
   Temporal changes in enzyme activities suggest a switch of the main
   substrate for decomposition between summer (soil organic matter) and
   autumn (plant litter). Our results indicate that ectomycorrhizal fungi
   are possibly involved in autumn cellulase and protease activity. Our

Volume = {{186}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Experimental evidence from a diverse set of forested ecosystems
   indicates that CO2 enrichment may lead to deeper rooting distributions.
   While the causes of greater root production at deeper soil depths under
   elevated CO2 concentration ({[}CO2]) require further investigation,
   altered rooting distributions are expected to affect important ecosystem
   processes. The depth at which fine roots are produced may influence root
   chemistry, physiological function, and mycorrhizal infection, leading to
   altered nitrogen (N) uptake rates and slower turnover. Also, soil
   processes such as microbial decomposition are slowed at depth in the
   soil, potentially affecting the rate at which root detritus becomes
   incorporated into soil organic matter. Deeper rooting distributions
   under elevated {[}CO2] provide exciting opportunities to use novel
   sensors and chemical analyses throughout the soil profile to track the
   effects of root proliferation on carbon (C) and N cycling. Models do not
   currently incorporate information on root turnover and C and N cycling
   at depth in the soil, and modification is necessary to accurately
   represent processes associated with altered rooting depth distributions.
   Progress in understanding and modeling the interface between deeper
   rooting distributions under elevated {[}CO2] and soil C and N cycling
   will be critical in projecting the sustainability of forest responses to
   rising atmospheric {[}CO2].}},

Abstract = {{Fungal peroxidases (ClassII) have a key role in degrading recalcitrant
   polyphenolic compounds in boreal forest wood, litter and humus. To date,
   their occurrence and activity have mainly been studied in a small number
   of white-rot wood decomposers. However, peroxidase activity is commonly
   measured in boreal forest humus and mineral soils, in which
   ectomycorrhizal fungi predominate. Here, we used degenerate PCR primers
   to investigate whether peroxidase-encoding genes are present in the
   genomes of a wide phylogenetic range of ectomycorrhizal taxa. Cloning
   and sequencing of PCR products showed that ectomycorrhizal fungi from
   several different genera possess peroxidase genes. The new sequences
   represent four major homobasidiomycete lineages, but the majority is
   derived from Cortinarius, Russula and Lactarius. These genera are
   ecologically important, but consist mainly of non-culturable species
   from which little ecophysiological information is available. The
   amplified sequences contain conserved active sites, both for folding and
   substrate oxidation. In some Cortinarius spp., there is evidence for
   gene duplications during the evolution of the genus. ClassII peroxidases
   seem to be an ancient and a common feature of most homobasidiomycetes,

Abstract = {{Dalbergia sissoo, an important tree of tropical regions, is grown as

   fertility in tropical regions results in poor plant growth. This is
   significant in the case of forest trees, since they are generally
   transplanted without considering the fertility status of soil. The

   leguminosarum strain DSP2 and D. sissoo showed improved plant growth
   response in the Entisol compared to uninoculated plants. The interaction
   of AMF with DSP2 was found; however, AMF did not show the same growth
   responses in combination with either GRPr or DSP2 and GRPr regardless of
   soil type. AMF and GRPr showed decreased plant growth, suggesting that
   enhanced plant growth was dependent on the bacteria - AMF combination

   mixing improved the substrate conditions by increased soil moisture, pH,

Abstract = {{The decomposition of soil organic matter in forest ecosystems is
   important in two ways. First, soil organic matter is the largest pool of
   C in terrestrial ecosystems, so understanding global carbon cycling
   requires an appreciation of the factors that control the size of that
   pool and the fluxes through it. Among these factors are those that
   control the rate of organic matter decomposition. Second, organic matter
   decomposition is the major process controlling the supply of nutrients
   to plants. In some ecosystems ectomycorrhizal. fungi comprise a
   surprisingly large fraction of soil organic matter. However, little is
   known of the rates of decomposition of ectomycorrhizal fungi, or of the
   factors that control those rates. Therefore, we set out to examine the
   relationship between N concentrations and decomposition rates of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi using a wide variety of strains isolated from a
   Pinus resinosa plantation. We found that substantial variation among
   strains existed in decomposition rate, and that decomposition rate was
   highly correlated with tissue N concentration. We conclude, therefore,
   that the structures of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities may be
   ecologically important in terms of ecosystem C and N dynamics. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Changes in temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric carbon dioxide
   (CO2) concentration that are expected in the coming decades will have
   profound impacts on terrestrial ecosystem net primary production (NPP).
   Nearly all models linking forest NPP with soil carbon (C) predict that
   increased NPP will result in either unchanged or increased soil C
   storage, and that decreased NPP will result in decreased soil C storage.
   However, linkages between forest productivity and soil C storage may not
   be so simple and direct. In an old-growth coniferous forest located in
   the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, OR, USA, we experimentally doubled
   needle litter inputs, and found that actual soil respiration rates
   exceeded those expected due to the C added by the extra needles. Here,
   we estimated that this `priming effect' accounted for 11.5-21.6\% of
   annual CO2 efflux from litter-amended plots, or an additional 137-256 g
   C m(-2) yr(-1) loss of stored C to the atmosphere. Soil priming was
   seasonal, with greatest amounts occurring in June-August coincident with
   peaks in temperature and dry summer conditions. As a result of priming,
   mineral soil was more resistant to further mineralization during
   laboratory incubations. Soil lignin-derived phenols in the Double Litter
   plots were more oxidized than in the control, suggesting that the soil
   residue was more degraded. Our hypothesis that excess dissolved organic
   C produced from the added litter provided the link between the forest
   floor and mineral soil and a substrate for soil priming was not
   supported. Instead, the rhizosphere, and associated mycorrhizal fungi,
   likely responded directly to the added aboveground litter inputs. Our
   results revealed that enhanced NPP may lead to accelerated processing of
   some stored soil C, but that the effects of increased NPP on ecosystem C
   storage will be based on a net balance among all ecosystem C pools and
   are likely to be ecosystem-dependant. Forest C models need to include
   these complex linkages between forest productivity and soil C storage.

Abstract = {{Forest litter is a large reservoir of organic compounds that adds CO2 to

   from litter decomposition is difficult because litter can undergo
   significant diurnal and day-to-day shifts in temperature. Moreover, the
   relationship between temperature and respiration may change if the

   Therefore, we studied the relationship between temperature and
   respiration by litter decomposer microorganisms in a Pinus resinosa
   (Ait.) system and tested the hypothesis that their respiration
   acclimates to temperature. We found only limited evidence for
   acclimation following 6 degrees C shifts for 7 days. This suggests that
   increase in respiratory CO2 loss associated with increased temperature
   would not be greatly ameliorated by physiological acclimation for
   periods of up to a week.}},

Abstract = {{We examined T matsutake survived in soil after forest fires in T
   matsutake-produced forest in the pre-fire period and the situation of
   damages from forest fire in stands. We established a square plot of (50
   mx50 m) in a burned site and divided it into 100 square quadrats of (5
   mx5 m). Tree density of P densiflora, the dominant tree species, in plot
   was 2,104/ha, with a basal area accounting for 99\%. The percentage of
   dead pine trees was 52.1\%, which is less than in other species as
   88.6\% and 100\% of Quercus spp. and Prunus sargentii, respectively. In
   PCR amplification using the T matsutake-specific primer pair, the 400-bp
   fragment was found in 29 of 100 soil sample s from each quadrat and in
   control Cultures. The relationship to the percentage of crown damage
   differed significantly (p=0.0026), with means between Tin and nTm of
   59\% and 70.5\%, respectively. Moreover, the difference between BLT and
   nBLT on crown damage was highly significant in the U-test (p=0.0008).
   Therefore, P densiflora in inner quadrats with low crown damage had T
   matsutake on their roots. T matsutake favor P densiflora and mineral
   soils with low litter rather than under BLT with a thick humus layer.
   The area of T matsutake from a forest fire in crown damage to R
   densiflora will eventually decrease in relation to the increase in BLT.
   Hence, the species distribution in understory vegetation such as shrub
   and BLT is an important factor for overstory tree survival from forest
   fires. In conclusion, the management of T matsutake forest by
   controlling tree density and taking out understory vegetation is
   considered a good method for decreasing damage from forest fires.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of earthworms to digest and assimilate microorganisms varies

   endogeic (Aporrectodea caliginosa, Octolasion tyrtaeum) and an epigeic
   (Dendrobaena octaedra) earthworm to determine the nature of naturally
   existing actinomycete community in earthworm casts. Earthworms were kept
   in soil free compartmented chambers containing leaf litter colonized
   with actinomycetes antagonistic to litter decomposer fungi and
   actinomycetes not antagonistic to litter decomposer fungi to infer
   feeding preferences of earthworms. The actinomycete population dynamics
   of the casts of the earthworms fed with single antagonistic actinomycete
   species and soil supplemented with these casts were investigated in
   order to understand the impacts of both endogeic and epigeic earthworms
   on the dispersal of actinomycetes antagonistic to the decomposer fungi.
   According to the current study, the cast actinomycete communities of
   epigeic (i.e. D. octaedra) and endogeic earthworms (i.e. A. caliginosa,
   O. tyrtaeum) consisted of frequently isolated actinomycetes of the
   forest floor. All the cast actinomycetes were Streptomyces species and
   most of them were found to be antagonistic to the common litter and wood
   decomposer fungi. All the casts had higher actinomycete counts than
   those in the surrounding soil.
   When leaf litter inoculated with antagonistic and non-antagonistic
   actinomycetes was supplied as the food choices for the earthworms, they
   preferentially consumed some of the highly antagonistic actinomycetes as
   well as some weakly antagonistic actinomycetes but the order of
   preference depended on the earthworm species. Many of the actinomycetes
   antagonistic to litter decomposer fungi survived gut passage but
   analysis of earthworm casts did not show any increase in actinomycete

   able to successfully spread into surrounding soil thereby increasing the

Abstract = {{To determine the dominant processes controlling nitrogen (N) dynamics in
   soils and increase insights into soil N cycling from nitrogen isotope
   (delta N-15) data, patterns of N-15 enrichment in soil profiles were
   compiled from studies on tropical, temperate, and boreal systems. The
   maximum N-15 enrichment between litter and deeper soil layers varied
   strongly with mycorrhizal fungal association, averaging 9.6 +/- A
   0.4aEuro degrees in ectomycorrhizal systems and 4.6 +/- A 0.5aEuro
   degrees in arbuscular mycorrhizal systems. The N-15 enrichment varied
   little with mean annual temperature, precipitation, or nitrification
   rates. One main factor controlling N-15 in soil profiles, fractionation
   against N-15 during N transfer by mycorrhizal fungi to host plants,
   leads to N-15-depleted plant litter at the soil surface and
   N-15-enriched nitrogen of fungal origin at depth. The preferential
   preservation of N-15-enriched compounds during decomposition and
   stabilization is a second important factor. A third mechanism, N loss
   during nitrification and denitrification, may account for large N-15
   enrichments with depth in less N-limited forests and may account for
   soil profiles where maximum delta N-15 is at intermediate depths. Mixing
   among soil horizons should also decrease differences among soil
   horizons. We suggest that dynamic models of isotope distributions within

Abstract = {{Logging residues, consisting of branches and treetops, are increasingly
   being extracted for biofuel purposes in Fennoscandia, thereby decreasing
   the availability of fine woody debris (FWD). Little is known about the
   importance of FWD and litter to fungal diversity, although they
   constitute the major components of dead organic matter in both managed
   and natural forests. We investigated the long-term effects of removing
   logging residue on the saprotrophic fungi community in the litter layer
   by using an experiment established 25 years ago, comprising stands with
   and without removal of clear-cut slash. The fungal communities were
   identified using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism from
   standardized baits of wood and needles left in the litter layer for 30
   months. A total of 74 fungal taxa were recorded. No differences in
   species richness or frequency of abundant species were detected between
   the stands with and without slash removal, suggesting that the
   extraction of logging residues has a negligible long-term impact on
   abundant saprotrophic fungi. Twenty-five of the 36 abundant species
   colonized wood and needles indiscriminately, while 10 species occurred
   exclusively on wood or needles and only one species mainly on wood. The
   importance of litter to certain wood-inhabiting fungi may therefore be
   underrated. The frequent records of Trichaptum abietinum (Dicks.)
   Ryvarden indicate that wood-inhabiting species may, surprisingly, be
   found in the litter layer.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of ectomycorrhizal fungi or rhizosphere bacteria on tree
   seedling growth and nutrient uptake is well known. However, few studies
   have combined those microorganisms in one experiment to clarify their
   relative contribution and interactions in nutrient acquisition. Here, we
   monitored the respective contributions of pine roots, two ubiquitous
   forest ectomycorrhizal fungi Scleroderma citrinum and Laccaria bicolor,
   and two S. citrinum-mycorrhizosphere bacterial strains of Burkholderia
   glathei and Collimonas sp., on mineral weathering, nutrient uptake, and
   plant growth. Pinus sylvestris plants were grown on quartz-biotite
   substrate and inoculated or not with combinations of mycorrhizal fungi
   and/or bacterial strains. Magnesium and potassium fluxes were measured
   and nutrient budgets were calculated. Both ectomycorrhizal fungi
   significantly increased Mg plant uptake. No significant effects of the
   two bacterial strains were detected on the K and Mg budgets, but
   co-inoculating the mycorrhizal fungus S. citrinum and the efficient
   mineral-weathering B. glathei bacterial strain significantly improved
   the Mg budget. Similarly, co-inoculating S. citrinum with the Collimonas
   sp. bacterial strain significantly improved the pine biomass compared to
   non-inoculated pine plants. In order to better understand this process,
   we monitored the survival of the inoculated bacterial strains in the
   quartz-biotite substrate, the pine rhizosphere, and the mycorrhizal
   niche. The results showed that the two bacterial strains harboured
   different colonization behaviours both of which depended on the presence
   of the ectomycorrhizal partner. The populations of the Burkholderia
   strain were maintained in all these environments with a significantly
   higher density in the mycorrhizal niche, especially of S. citrinum. In
   contrast the population of the Collimonas strain reached the detection
   level except in the treatment inoculated with S. citrinum. These results
   highlight the need for taking into account the ecology of the

Abstract = {{An accurate assessment of soil organic matter dynamics is critical for
   understanding and predicting ecosystem responses to anthropogenic
   perturbation such as climate change, pollution and agriculture. These
   measurements of carbon (C) turnover are frequently made in the
   laboratory where it is easier to control the experimental conditions.
   However, this could potentially bias the results due to a range of
   factors including the absence of plants and associated mycorrhizas,
   physical disturbance, alteration in redox status etc. The aim of this
   study was therefore to directly compare the turnover of organic acids
   under field and laboratory conditions in three contrasting land use
   regimes (grassland, woodland and arable). The method involved the
   injection of C-14-labeled citric acid into the top soil and monitoring
   of its mineralization by capturing (CO2)-C-14 evolved from the soil over
   a 7 day period. Laboratory climate conditions were matched to those in
   the field. In both the laboratory and the field we showed that
   (CO2)-C-14 evolution followed a bi-phasic pattern and conformed
   extremely well to a double first-order kinetic model. While the first
   rapid mineralization phase showed a similar half-life for citrate under
   both laboratory and field conditions (4.9 +/- 0.7 h), the second slower
   mineralization phase had a significantly longer half-life when performed
   in the field. Overall, our results suggest that the first rapid
   mineralization phase was largely independent of our experimental
   conditions whilst the turnover of the citrate-derived C immobilized in
   the microbial biomass was significantly affected by the incubation
   conditions either due to differences in substrate utilization and
   storage pathways or due to faster microbial turnover in the laboratory.

Abstract = {{Many field and laboratory studies have demonstrated that the addition of
   easily available carbon can increase rates of decomposition of plant
   litter or humified soil organic matter, though opposite trends are also
   common. In boreal forests, a large part of labile carbon enters soil via
   tree roots and ectomycorrhizal (EM) network. The influence of increased
   C availability and the presence of EM roots on litter decomposition was
   studied in a long-term field experiment in a 50-year-old Picea abies
   plantation. Litterbags containing litter of three species (Populus
   tremula, Quercus robur, or P. abies) were buried to the depth of ca. 2.5
   cm. The experiment was set up in a full-factorial design with carbon
   availability and presence of roots as factors. Carbon was added as an
   aqueous sucrose solution (50 g C m(-2)) every second week during
   snow-free period. Spruce roots around and underneath experimental plots
   were cut once a month. Subsets of litterbags were analysed after 12, 21
   and 24 months. The serial dilution technique was used to assess the
   fungal community composition. The addition of labile carbon led to a
   strong decrease in litter decomposition rates, associated with
   consistent shifts in the composition of saprotrophic microfungal
   communities, and to an increase in the overall density of culturable
   fungal species (r-strategists), but not of specialized cellulolytic
   microfungi (K-strategists), isolated on Hutchinson agar. Sucrose
   addition did not affect the number of species isolated but the dominance
   structure was shifted toward the domination of the 2-4 most abundant
   species. The presence of EM roots significantly reduced moisture content
   in decomposing litter but had only weak and inconsistent effect on the
   decomposition rates and on the community composition of saprotrophic
   microfungi; these effects did not depend on the level of carbon
   availability. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   multivariate analysis and ordination for pooling of ecological groups of

   closed canopy stands indicates an effect of forest management practice
   and the high importance of maintaining and protecting natural forest
   areas for conservation of soil biodiversity and forest genetic
   resources. The ordination analysis revealed three groups of
   ectomycorrhiza correlated with changing environmental conditions. The
   litter and soil pH, number of beech seedlings, and presence of a gap had
   a pronounced effect on the ectomycorrhizal community. Combined analysis

Abstract = {{A comprehensive appraisal of the mycorrhizal literature provides data
   for 336 plant families representing 99\% of flowering plants, with
   regard to mycorrhizas and other nutritional adaptations. In total,
   arbuscular (AM), orchid, ectomycorrhizas (EM) and ericoid mycorrhizas
   and nonmycorrhizal (NM) roots occur in 74\%, 9\%, 2\%, 1\% and 6\% of
   Angiosperm species respectively. Many families of NM plants have
   alternative nutritional strategies such as parasitism, carnivory, or
   cluster roots. The remaining angiosperms (8\%) belong to families
   reported to have both AM and NM species. These are designated as NM-AM
   families here and tend to occur in habitats considered non-conducive to
   mycorrhizal fungi, such as epiphytic, aquatic, extremely cold, dry,
   disturbed, or saline habitats. Estimated numbers of species in each
   category of mycorrhizas is presented with lists of NM and EM families.
   Evolutionary trends are also summarised by providing data on all clades
   and orders of flowering and non-flowering vascular plants on a global
   scale. A case study of Western Australian plants revealed that plants
   with specialised nutritional modes such as carnivory, cluster roots, or
   EM were much more diverse in this ancient landscape with infertile soils
   than elsewhere. Detailed information on the mycorrhizal diversity of
   plants presented here is linked to a website (mycorrhizas.info) to allow
   data to remain current. Over a century of research effort has resulted
   in data on mycorrhizal associations of > 10,000 plant species that are
   of great value, but also somewhat of a liability due to conflicting
   information about some families and genera. It is likely that these
   conflicts result in part from misdiagnosis of mycorrhizal associations
   resulting from a lack of standardisation in criteria used to define
   them. Families that contain both NM and AM species provide a second
   major source of inconsistency, but even when these are excluded there is
   a similar to 10\% apparent error rate in published lists of mycorrhizal
   plants. Arbuscules are linked to AM misdiagnosis since they are used
   less often than vesicles to recognise AM associations in roots and
   apparently occur sporadically in NM plants. Key issues with the
   diagnosis of mycorrhizal plants are discussed using the Cyperaceae as a
   case study. Detailed protocols designed to consistently distinguish AM
   from endophytic Glomeromycotan Fungus Colonisation (GFC) are provided.

Abstract = {{Mature deciduous forests can serve as important carbon (C) sinks, but
   the C storage differs significantly in dependency on the tree species.
   To specify the significance of overstory-specific effects of litter fall
   on the soil microbial C turnover, we have investigated the C-13 isotopic
   signature of microbial biomarker phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs).
   Samples were taken under pure Fagus sylvatica and mixed overstory (F.
   sylvatica and Fraxinus excelsior or F. excelsior, Acer spp. and F.
   sylvatica) in a mature temperate deciduous forest in Central Germany 4
   weeks prior to and 3 weeks after litter fall. Accordingly, the CO2
   emission from soil was measured before, during and after the litter fall
   to investigate the response of decomposition. At all sites and at both
   sampling dates the fungal biomarker PLFA 18:2 omega 6,9 had
   predominantly lower delta C-13 values (from -32 to -43 parts per
   thousand) than the bacterial biomarker PLFAs (delta C-13 values from -23
   to -39 parts per thousand). This difference indicated that fungi
   generally used preferentially plant derived C, whereas the bacterial
   populations include groups which used SOM derived C, independent on the
   overstory, trees. Under pure F. sylvatica overstory the delta C-13
   values of microbial biomarker PLFAs were slightly decreased (up to 2
   parts per thousand for 17:0br) or unchanged after litter fall. By
   contrast, under both variants of mixed overstory the delta C-13 values
   of biomarker PLFAs of fungi (18:2w6,9) were increased after litter fall
   (+3.5 and +3.8 parts per thousand). This might be explained partly by a
   faster initial decomposition of foliar litter from mixed overstory
   already during litter fall as confirmed by higher CO2 emission under
   mixed F. excelsior, Acer spp. and F. sylvatica than under pure F
   sylvatica in this period. However, the involved microbial populations
   differed overstory-specific. Bacterial biomarker PLFAs with strongest
   overstory-specific differences in the response on litter fall were
   17:0br (Gram-positive bacteria), 18:1 and 19:0cy (Gram-negative
   bacteria). The present results indicate that a tree species conversion
   even exclusively between deciduous tree species might alter the soil
   microbial C turnover during litter decomposition and suggest that it
   would in the long-term change the SOM stability and C storage. (C) 2009

   Castoreum radicatum, Mesophellia clelandii and Nothocastoreum cretaceum,
   with the type of response varying. Below a threshold, C. radicatum
   preferred sites with cooler mean annual temperatures. In contrast, M.
   clelandii and N. cretaceum had optimal ranges of temperature, above and
   below which the probability of detecting them dropped. Also at a
   landscape scale, C. radicatum was more likely to be detected at sites
   with lower levels of precipitation during the driest quarter of the
   year. At a micro-site scale, M. clelandii and N. cretaceum were more
   likely to occur in stands with an intermediate number of host eucalypt
   stems, likely relating to successional age of the stand. Sites with a
   higher number of large fallen trees were more likely to have N.
   cretaceum, while sites with intermediate litter depths were more likely
   to have C. radicatum and M. clelandii. Mesophellia glauca and M.
   trabalis showed no consistent patterns. They are apparently the most
   broadly adaptable in terms of the independent variables tested. Although
   fire has been previously suggested to be heavily implicated in the life
   cycle of several members of the Mesophelliaceae, we found no
   relationship between time since disturbance by fire and other factors
   and likelihood of occurrence. Instead, other habitat attributes appeared
   to be more important in explaining their distribution. The complex and
   differing responses of the species of Mesophelliaceae studied here, to
   features of their environment, reinforce the need to manage multiple-use
   forest landscapes across the region for a diversity of attributes. (C)

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to compare the monoterpene content and
   distribution in litters and roots of three conifer species: Picea abies
   (L) Karst, Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. and Pinus sylvestris (L). We
   analysed the monoterpene content of green needles, needle litter, F
   (fermentation) layer material and roots collected from monoculture
   plots. The rate of loss of monoterpenes from freshly fallen litter in
   the field was also studied at two monthly intervals over 10 months, to
   assess the length of time that monoterpenes entering the litter layer
   remain. Monoterpene analysis was carried out by extracting homogenised
   samples in hexane and identifying and quantifying the resulting
   monoterpenes using gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection
   (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Mean total
   monoterpene concentrations varied significantly between the three
   species examined (e.g. in freshly fallen litter 1531 +/- 96, 100 +/- 5
   and 1175 +/- 122 mu g g(-1) d. wt for P. abies, P. sitchensis and P.
   sylvestris); each species had distinctive and consistent monoterpene
   profiles associated with each type of tissue, and total monoterpene
   concentrations in green needles varied between individual trees of the
   same species, particularly for P. sitchensis. A substantial proportion
   of the monoterpene content of green needles remained in the needles
   after litter fall for P. abies (42\%), P. sitchensis (11\%) and P.
   sylvestris (30\%). Although rates of monoterpene loss from needle
   litters varied initially (P sylvestris > P. abies > P. sitchensis), the
   majority of the monoterpene content was lost after 4-6 months. Maximum
   monoterpene emission rates from decaying litter were calculated of 39 (P
   abies), 1.7 (P. sitchensis) and 39 mu g m(-2) h(-1) (P. sylvestris).
   Monoterpene concentrations in F layer material were very low (<10 mu g
   g(-1) d. wt). Roots, particularly in P. sylvestris, represented a
   significant pool of monoterpenes (185 +/- 16, P. abies; 258 +/- 54, P.
   sitchensis; 2133 +/- 200 mu g g(-1) d. wt, P. sylvestris). The
   monoterpene profile was similar between roots and litter of P.
   sylvestris (a-pinene most abundant), and for P. sitchensis, (limonene
   and a-pinene most abundant), although a different pattern was observed
   between needle litter (most abundant beta-pinene) and roots (most
   abundant myrcene) of P abies. The relatively high concentrations and
   different profiles of monoterpenes characterised in upper organic soil
   horizons here emphasise the need for their influence on soil ecological
   processes to be assessed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The soil animal food web has become a focus of recent ecological
   research but trophic relationships still remain enigmatic for many taxa,
   Analysis of stable isotope ratios of N and C provides a powerful tool
   for disentangling food web structure. In this study, animals, roots,
   soil and litter material from a temperate deciduous forest were
   analysed. The combined measurement of delta N-15 and delta C-13 provided
   insights into the compartmentalization of the soil animal food web. Leaf
   litter feeders were separated from animals relying mainly on recent
   belowground carbon resources and from animals feeding on older carbon.
   The trophic pathway of leaf litter-feeding species appears to be a dead
   end, presumably because leaf litter feeders (mainly diplopods and
   oribatid mites) are unavailable to predators due to large size and/or
   strong sclerotization. Endogeic earthworms that rely on older carbon
   also appear to exist in predator-free space. The data suggest that the
   largest trophic compartment constitutes of ectomycorrhizal feeders and
   their predators. Additionally, there is a smaller trophic compartment
   consisting of predators likely feeding on enchytraeids and potentially
   nematodes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide is released from the soil to the atmosphere in
   heterotrophic respiration when the dead organic matter is used for
   substrates for soil micro-organisms and soil animals. Respiration of
   roots and mycorrhiza is another major source of carbon dioxide in soil
   CO2 efflux. The partitioning of these two fluxes is essential for
   understanding the carbon balance of forest ecosystems and for modelling
   the carbon cycle within these ecosystems. In this study, we determined
   the carbon balance of three common tree species in boreal forest zone,
   Scots pine, Norway spruce, and Silver birch with gas exchange
   measurements conducted in laboratory in controlled temperature and light
   conditions. We also studied the allocation pattern of assimilated carbon
   with C-14 pulse labelling experiment. The photosynthetic light responses
   of the tree species were substantially different. The maximum
   photosynthetic capacity (P (max)) was 2.21 mu g CO2 s(-1) g(-1) in Scots
   pine, 1.22 mu g CO2 s(-1) g(-1) in Norway spruce and 3.01 mu g CO2 s(-1)
   g(-1) in Silver birch seedlings. According to the pulse labelling
   experiments, 43-75\% of the assimilated carbon remained in the
   aboveground parts of the seedlings. The amount of carbon allocated to
   root and rhizosphere respiration was about 9-26\%, and the amount of
   carbon allocated to root and ectomycorrhizal biomass about 13-21\% of
   the total assimilated CO2. The (CO2)-C-14 pulse reached the root system
   within few hours after the labelling and most of the pulse had passed
   the root system after 48 h. The transport rate of carbon from shoot to

Abstract = {{Relationships between mycorrhizal plants and soil nitrogen (N) have led
   to the speculation that the chemistry of plant litter and the
   saprotrophy of mycorrhizal symbionts can function together to closely
   couple the N cycle between plants and soils. We hypothesized that a
   tannin-rich, ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) plant promotes the retention of
   protein-tannin N in soil, and that this N source is accessible to
   saprotrophic ERM symbionts and their hosts, but remains less available
   to co-occurring ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)
   symbionts and their hosts.
   We tested this feedback hypothesis in a southern Appalachian forest
   community composed of two microsites: a hardwood microsite with ECM and
   AM trees in the overstorey and understorey, and an AM herb layer; and a
   rhododendron microsite where the understorey and herb layer are replaced
   by ERM rhododendron. We synthesized N-15-enriched protein-tannin
   complexes from leaf litter extracts representing each forest microsite
   and examined the fate of N-15 in soil volumes 3 months and 1 year after
   the complexes were placed in the field.
   Protein-tannin complexes derived from the rhododendron microsite led to
   a higher retention of N-15 in soil organic matter and a lower recovery
   in dissolved N pools than those from the hardwood microsite, supporting
   the hypothesis that rhododendron tannins create stable complexes that
   increase organic N retention in soils.
   Rhododendron complexes led to greater N-15-enrichment in ERM roots than
   in AM and ECM roots, supporting the hypothesis that rhododendron can
   better access the N complexed by its own litter tannins than can
   co-occurring forest trees and plants. Our results suggest that both
   fungal saprotrophy and a high specific root length contribute to the
   ability of ERM roots to acquire N from complex organic sources.
   Synthesis. This study provides evidence of an intricate N feedback where
   plant litter chemistry influences the cycle of N to maximize N
   acquisition by the host's mycorrhizal roots, while hindering N
   acquisition by mycorrhizal roots of co-occurring plants. Feedback
   processes such as these have the potential to drive patterns in nitrogen
   cycling and productivity in many terrestrial ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic release of biologically available N has increased
   atmospheric N deposition in forest ecosystems, which may slow
   decomposition by reducing the lignolytic activity of white-rot fungi. We
   investigated the potential for atmospheric N deposition to reduce the
   abundance and alter the composition of lignolytic basidiomycetes in a
   regional network of four northern hardwood forest stands receiving
   experimental NO3 (-) deposition (30 kg NO3 (-)-N ha(-1) year(-1)) for a
   decade. To estimate the abundance of basidiomycetes with lignolytic
   potential, we used PCR primers targeting laccase (polyphenol oxidase)
   and quantitative fluorescence PCR to estimate gene copy number. Natural
   variation in laccase gene size permitted use of length heterogeneity PCR
   to profile basidiomycete community composition across two sampling dates
   in forest floor and mineral soil. Although past work has identified
   significant and consistent negative effects of NO3 (-) deposition on
   lignolytic enzyme activity, microbial biomass, soil respiration, and
   decomposition rate, we found no consistent effect of NO3 (-) deposition
   on basidiomycete laccase gene abundance or community profile. Rather,
   laccase abundance under NO3 (-) deposition was lower (-52\%), higher
   (+223\%), or unchanged, depending on stand. Only a single stand
   exhibited a significant change in basidiomycete laccase gene profile.
   Basidiomycete laccase genes occurring in mineral soil were a subset of
   the genes observed in the forest floor. Moreover, significant effects on
   laccase abundance were confined to the forest floor, suggesting that
   species composition plays some role in determining how lignolytic
   basidiomycetes are affected by N deposition. Community profiles differed
   between July and October sampling dates, and basidiomycete communities
   sampled in October had lower laccase gene abundance in the forest floor,
   but higher laccase abundance in mineral soil. Although experimental N
   deposition significantly suppresses lignolytic activity in these
   forests, this change is not related to the abundance or community
   composition of basidiomycete fungi with laccase genes. Understanding the
   expression of laccases and other lignolytic enzymes by basidiomycete
   fungi and other lignin-decaying organisms appears to hold promise for
   explaining the consistent decline in lignolytic activity elicited by
   experimental N deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic material (SOM) is usually enriched in N-15 in deeper soil
   layers. This has been explained by discrimination against the heavier
   isotope during decomposition or by the accumulation of N-15-enriched
   microbial biomass versus plant biomass in older SOM. In particular,
   ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi have been suggested to accumulate in old SOM
   since this group is among the most N-15-enriched components of the
   microbial community. In the present study we investigated the microbial
   community in soil samples along a chronosequence (7,800 years) of sites
   undergoing isostatic rebound in northern Sweden. The composition of the
   microbial community was analyzed and related to the delta N-15 and delta
   C-13 isotope values of the SOM in soil profiles. A significant change in
   the composition of the microbial community was found during the first
   2,000 years, and this was positively related to an increase in the delta
   N-15 values of the E and B horizons in the mineral soil. The proportion
   of fungal phospholipid fatty acids increased with time in the
   chronosequence and was positively related to the N-15 enrichment of the
   SOM. The increase in delta C-13 in the SOM was much less than the
   increase in delta N-15, and delta C-13 values in the mineral soil were
   only weakly related to soil age. The C:N ratio and the pH of the soil
   were important factors determining the composition of the microbial
   community. We suggest that the N being transported from the soil to
   aboveground tissue by EM fungi is a driver for N-15 enrichment of soil
   profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical and modeling studies of the N cycle in temperate forests of

   We quantified fine root biomass and applied tracer-level quantities of

   N uptake in the oak-beech-hemlock stand, a stand that produces
   recalcitrant litter, cycles N slowly and has a thick, amino acid-rich
   organic horizon. By contrast, glycine accounted for only 20\% of total N
   uptake in the sugar maple and white ash stand, a stand characterized by
   labile litter and rapid rates of amino acid production and turnover
   resulting in high rates of mineralization and nitrification. This study

Abstract = {{Understanding the contribution of genetic variation within foundation
   species to community-level pattern and diversity represents the
   cornerstone of the developing field of community genetics. We assessed
   the relative importance of intraspecific genetic variation, spatial
   variation within a forest and microhabitat variation on a macrofungal
   decay community developing on logs of the Australian forest tree,
   Eucalyptus globulus. Uniform logs were harvested from trees from eight
   geographic races of E. globulus growing in a 15-year-old genetic trial.
   Logs were placed as designed grids within a native E. globulus forest
   and after 3 years of natural colonisation the presence of 62 macrofungal
   taxa were recorded from eight microhabitats on each log. The key factor
   found to drive macrofungal distribution and biodiversity on structurally
   uniform coarse woody debris was log-microhabitat, explaining 42\% of the
   total variation in richness. Differences between log-microhabitats
   appeared to be due to variation in aspect, substrate (bark vs wood) and
   area/time of exposure to colonisation. This findings demonstrates the
   importance of considering fine-scale (within substrate) variation in the
   conservation and management of macrofungal biodiversity, an area that
   has received little previous attention. While a number of recent studies
   have demonstrated that the genetics of foundation tree species can
   influence dependent communities, this was not found to be the case for
   the early log decay community associated with E. globulus. Despite
   genetic variation in wood and bark properties existing within this
   species, there was no significant effect of tree genetics on macrofungal
   community richness or composition. This finding highlights the variation
   that may exist among guilds of organisms in their response to genetic
   variation within foundation species, an important consideration in a
   promising new area of research.}},

   measurements of growth; acetate incorporation into ergosterol, and
   leucine incorporation for fungi and bacteria, respectively. The higher
   organic matter content of the canopy soils correlated with higher fungal
   growth. The relative importance of fungi, indicated by fungal: bacterial
   growth ratio, was higher in the canopy soil of the Maple site, while
   there was no difference in the Alder site. The high C:N ratio of the
   Maple canopy soil likely contributed to this difference. These results

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Buttressing is a trait special to tropical trees but explanations for
   its occurrence remain inconclusive. The two main hypotheses are that
   they provide structural support and/or promote nutrient acquisition.
   Studies of the first are common but the second has received much less
   attention. Architectural measurements were made on adult and juvenile
   trees of the ectomycorrhizal species Microberlinia bisulcata, in Korup
   (Cameroon). Buttressing on this species is highly distinctive with
   strong lateral extension of surface roots of the juveniles leading to a
   mature buttress system of a shallow spreading form on adults. This
   contrasts with more vertical buttresses, closer to the stem, found on
   many other tropical tree species. No clear relationship between main
   buttress and large branch distribution was found. Whilst this does not
   argue against the essential structural role of buttresses for these very
   large tropical trees, the form on M. bisulcata does suggest a likely
   second role, that of aiding nutrient acquisition. At the Korup site,
   with its deep sandy soils of very low phosphorus status, and where most
   nutrient cycling takes place in a thin surface layer of fine roots and
   mycorrhizas, it appears that buttress form could develop from
   soil-surface root exploration for nutrients by juvenile trees. It may
   accordingly allow M. bisulcata to attain the higher greater competitive
   ability, faster growth rate, and maximum tree size that it does compared
   with other co-occurring tree species. For sites across the tropics in
   general, the degree of shallowness and spatial extension of buttresses
   of the dominant species is hypothesized to increase with decreasing
   nutrient availability.}},

Abstract = {{The functional roles of fungi in recovery of forest ecosystems after

   two widely separated sites, one in the Pacific Northwest United States
   and the other in southeastern mainland Australia. The range of species
   on-site was compared against macrofungi reported after the volcanic
   eruption at Mount St. Helens, also in the Pacific Northwest. Each of the
   three sites shared species, particularly representatives of the genus
   Anthracobia. Soon after disturbance, we noted extensive mycelial mats
   and masses of fruit-bodies of this genus, particularly at heavily
   impacted microsites. The mycelial mats appeared to play an important
   functional role on-site, possibly aggregating soil particles in
   otherwise highly erodable landscapes. We hypothesise that fungi such as
   Anthrocobia are pivotal species in early system recovery after
   disturbance, helping minimize the movement of soil in the absence of
   plant roots. As plant root systems recover, the importance of these
   fungi in soil stabilization may diminish. Other functional roles of

Abstract = {{Climate warming and associated increases in nutrient mineralization may
   increase the availability of soil nitrogen (N) in high latitude
   ecosystems, such as boreal forests. These changes in N availability
   could feed back to affect the decomposition of litter and organic matter
   by soil microbes. Since fungi are important decomposers in boreal forest
   ecosystems, we conducted a 69-day incubation study to examine N
   constraints on fungal decomposition of organic substrates common in
   boreal ecosystems, including cellulose, lignin, spruce wood, spruce
   needle litter, and moss litter. We added 0, 20, or 200 mu g N to vials
   containing 200 mg substrate in factorial combination with five fungal
   species isolated from boreal soil. including an Ascomycete, a
   Zygomycete, and three Basidiomycetes. We hypothesized that N addition
   would increase CO2 mineralization from the substrates, particularly
   those with low N concentrations. In addition we predicted that
   Basidiomycetes would be more effective decomposers than the other fungi,
   but would respond weakly or negatively to N additions. In support of the
   first hypothesis, cumulative CO2 mineralization increased from 635 +/-
   117 to 806 + 108 mu g C across all fungal species and substrates in
   response to 20 jig added N; however, there was no significant increase
   at the highest level of N addition. The positive effect of N addition
   was only significant on cellulose and wood substrates which contained
   very little N. We also observed clear differences in the substrate
   preferences of the fungal species. The Zygomycete mineralized little CO2
   from any of the substrates, while the Basidiomycetes mineralized all of
   the substrates except spruce needles. However, the Ascomycete
   (Penicillium) was surprisingly efficient at mineralizing spruce wood and
   was the only species that substantially mineralized spruce litter. The
   activities of beta-glucosidase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase were
   strongly correlated with cumulative respiration (r 0.78 and 0.74,
   respectively), and Penicillium was particularly effective at producing
   these enzymes. On moss litter, the different fungal species produced
   enzymes that targeted different chemical components. Overall, our
   results suggest that fungal species specialize on different organic
   substrates, and only respond to N addition on low N Substrates, such as
   wood. Furthermore, the response to N addition is non-linear, with the
   greatest substrate mineralization at intermediate N levels. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Phenolics are a dominant class of plant secondary metabolites that have
   strong effects on various ecosystem processes. The ecological
   significance of these compounds, however, is still poorly understood. We
   hypothesized that the inhibitory effects of phenolics on microbial
   activity could enhance plant nitrogen acquisition by relaxing
   competition between plants and microbes. To test this hypothesis
   theoretically, we constructed a novel and simple mechanistic model by
   unifying two concepts: one is a new paradigm of nitrogen cycling which
   considers the uptake of organic nitrogen by plants, and the other is
   that phenolics can regulate nitrogen cycling by inhibiting microbial
   decomposition processes. Our plant-microbe competition model consists of
   five compartments (plants, soil microbes, debris, organic nitrogen and
   inorganic nitrogen) and incorporates the essential processes of nitrogen
   cycling: plant uptake of monomers, competition between plants and
   microbes, and the depolymerization process. Our analysis showed that
   plant nitrogen acquisition was maximized at intermediate levels of
   phenolics, but only when plants could utilize organic nitrogen.
   Furthermore, this pattern occurred over a broad range of parameter
   conditions. Our study successfully demonstrated the potential role of

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition affects a wide range of soil
   processes including phenol oxidase (PO) activity and soil organic matter
   dynamics. Depression of phenol oxidase activity in response to N
   saturation is believed to be mediated by the activity of white-rot
   basidiomycetes, whose production of extracellular oxidative enzymes can
   be limited by high N availability. We examined the effect of short-term
   N deposition on basidiomycete laccase gene diversity and relative
   abundance in temperate oak forest soil in which significant decreases in
   phenol oxidase and increased SOM have been recorded in response to
   experimental N deposition. UniFrac was used to compare the composition
   of laccase genes between three control- and three nitrogen-fertilized
   (80 kg(-1) ha(-1) per year) oak forest soils. The relative abundance of
   laccase genes was determined from qPCR analysis of laccase and
   basidiomycete ITS gene abundances. Our results indicate that there was
   no significant shift in the composition of laccase genes between
   control- and N-fertilized soils, nor was there a significant change in
   the relative abundance of laccase genes. These data suggest that N
   deposition effects on mineral soil PO activity do not result from
   changes in laccase gene diversity of white-rot basidiomycetes but are
   likely the result of altered microbial abundance or expression in this

   factors that structure microbial communities in general, as soil laccase
   gene communities are more similar to other forest soils than with the

Abstract = {{P>Mycoheterotrophic orchids have adapted to shaded forest understory by
   shifting to achlorophylly and receiving carbon from their mycorrhizal
   fungi. In temperate forests, they associate in a highly specific way
   with fungi forming ectomycorrhizas on nearby trees, and exploiting tree
   photosynthates. However, many rainforests lack ectomycorrhizal fungi,
   and there is evidence that some tropical Asiatic species associate with
   saprotrophic fungi.
   To investigate this in different geographic and phylogenetic contexts,
   we identified the mycorrhizal fungi supporting two tropical
   mycoheterotrophic orchids from Mascarene (Indian Ocean) and Caribbean
   islands. We tested their possible carbon sources by measuring natural
   nitrogen (15N) and carbon (13C) abundances.
   Saprotrophic basidiomycetes were found: Gastrodia similis associates
   with a wood-decaying Resinicium (Hymenochaetales); Wullschlaegelia
   aphylla associates with both litter-decaying Gymnopus and Mycena
   species, whose rhizomorphs link orchid roots to leaf litter. The 15N and
   13C abundances make plausible food chains from dead wood to G. similis
   and from dead leaves to W. aphylla.
   We propose that temperature and moisture in rainforests, but not in most
   temperate forests, may favour sufficient saprotrophic activity to
   support development of mycoheterotrophs. By enlarging the spectrum of
   mycorrhizal fungi and the level of specificity in mycoheterotrophic
   orchids, this study provides new insights on orchid and mycorrhizal
   biology in the tropics.

Abstract = {{In forest soils, ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic Agaricales differ in
   their strategies for carbon acquisition, but share common gene families
   encoding multi-copper oxidases (MCOs). These enzymes are involved in the

   The MCO gene family of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor is
   composed of 11 genes divided into two distinct subfamilies corresponding
   to laccases (lcc) sensu stricto (lcc1 to lcc9), sharing a high sequence
   homology with the coprophilic Coprinopsis cinerea laccase genes, and to
   ferroxidases (lcc10 and lcc11) that are not present in C. cinerea. The
   fet3-like ferroxidase genes lcc10 and lcc11 in L. bicolor are each
   arranged in a mirrored tandem orientation with an ftr gene coding for an
   iron permease. Unlike C. cinerea, L. bicolor has no sid1/sidA gene for
   siderophore biosynthesis.
   Transcript profiling using whole-genome expression arrays and
   quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
   revealed that some transcripts were very abundant in ectomycorrhizas
   (lcc3 and lcc8), in fruiting bodies (lcc7) or in the free-living
   mycelium grown on agar medium (lcc9 and lcc10), suggesting a specific

   a-pinene or P-pinene resulted in a significantly greater proportion of
   root tips being colonised by the fungus when it was grown with seedlings
   of Picea abies (L) Karst. Exposure to monoterpenes resulted in a
   significant decrease in respiration rate of two species of litter
   degrading SP fungi, Mycena galopus var. candida J. E. Lange and Collybia
   butyracea (Bull.) P. Kumm. There was no difference in response between
   the two SP species, despite the fact that previous tests in liquid
   nutrient media, with monoterpenes at higher concentrations, indicated
   that one species was sensitive and one was not. The high volatility and
   low solubility of monoterpenes in water make them challenging to work
   with. The experimental system developed here. although still artificial,
   provides a bridge between pure culture studies in defined media and all
   the complexities of forest soils in the field, by allowing the exposure
   of fungi to environmentally relevant monoterpene concentrations in more
   natural substrata. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Climate warming is expected to have particularly strong effects on
   tundra and boreal ecosystems, yet relatively few studies have examined
   soil responses to temperature change in these systems. We used
   closed-top greenhouses to examine the response of soil respiration,
   nutrient availability, microbial abundance, and active fungal
   communities to soil warming in an Alaskan boreal forest dominated by
   mature black spruce. This treatment raised soil temperature by 0.5
   degrees C and also resulted in a 22\% decline in soil water content. We
   hypothesized that microbial abundance and activity would increase with
   the greenhouse treatment. Instead, we found that bacterial and fungal
   abundance declined by over 50\%, and there was a trend toward lower
   activity of the chitin-degrading enzyme N-acetyl-glucosaminidase. Soil
   respiration also declined by up to 50\%, but only late in the growing
   season. These changes were accompanied by significant shifts in the
   community structure of active fungi, with decreased relative abundance
   of a dominant Thelephoroid fungus and increased relative abundance of
   Ascomycetes and Zygomycetes in response to warming. In line with our
   hypothesis, we found that warming marginally increased soil ammonium and
   nitrate availability as well as the overall diversity of active fungi.
   Our results indicate that rising temperatures in northern-latitude
   ecosystems may not always cause a positive feedback to the soil carbon
   cycle, particularly in boreal forests with drier soils. Models of carbon
   cycle-climate feedbacks could increase their predictive power by
   incorporating heterogeneity in soil properties and microbial communities
   across the boreal zone.}},

Abstract = {{The fungi-to-bacteria ratio in soil ecological concepts and its
   application to explain the effects of land use changes have gained
   increasing attention over the past decade. Four different main
   approaches for quantifying the fungal and bacterial contribution to
   microbial tissue can be distinguished: (1) microscopic methods, (2)
   selective inhibition, (3) specific cell membrane components and (4)
   specific cell wall components. In this review, the different methods
   were compared and we hypothesized that all these approaches result in
   similar values for the fungal and bacterial contribution to total
   microbial biomass, activity, and residues (dead microbial tissue) if
   these methods are evenly reliable for the estimation of fungal biomass.
   The fungal contribution to the microbial biomass or respiration varied
   widely between 2 and 95\% in different data sets published over the past
   three decades. However, the majority of the literature data indicated
   that fungi dominated microbial biomass, respiration or non-biomass
   microbial residues, with mean percentages obtained by the different
   methodological approaches varying between 35 and 76\% in different soil
   groups, i.e. arable, grassland, and forest soils and litter layers.
   Microscopic methods generally gave the lowest average values, especially
   in arable and grasslands soils. Very low ratios in fungal biomass
   C-to-ergosterol obtained by microscopic methods suggest a severe
   underestimation of fungal biomass by certain stains. Relatively
   consistent ratios of ergosterol to linoleic acid (18:2 omega 6,9)
   indicate that both cell membrane components are useful indicators for
   saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi. More quantitative information on
   the PLFA content of soil bacteria and the 16:1 omega 5 content of
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is urgently required to fully exploit the
   great potential of PLFA measurements. The most consistent results have
   been obtained from the analysis of fungal glucosamine and bacterial
   muramic acid in microbial residues. Component-specific delta C-13
   analyses of PLFA and amino sugars are a promising prospect for the near
   future. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal forests contain significant quantities of soil carbon that may be
   oxidized to CO2 given future increases in climate warming and wildfire
   behavior. At the ecosystem scale, decomposition and heterotrophic
   respiration are strongly controlled by temperature and moisture, but we
   questioned whether changes in microbial biomass, activity, or community
   structure induced by fire might also affect these processes. We
   particularly wanted to understand whether postfire reductions in
   microbial biomass could affect rates of decomposition. Additionally, we
   compared the short-term effects of wildfire to the long-term effects of
   climate warming and permafrost decline. We compared soil microbial
   communities between control and recently burned soils that were located
   in areas with and without permafrost near Delta Junction, AK. In
   addition to soil physical variables, we quantified changes in microbial
   biomass, fungal biomass, fungal community composition, and C cycling
   processes (phenol oxidase enzyme activity, lignin decomposition, and
   microbial respiration). Five years following fire, organic surface
   horizons had lower microbial biomass, fungal biomass, and dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) concentrations compared with control soils.
   Reductions in soil fungi were associated with reductions in phenol
   oxidase activity and lignin decomposition. Effects of wildfire on
   microbial biomass and activity in the mineral soil were minor. Microbial
   community composition was affected by wildfire, but the effect was
   greater in nonpermafrost soils. Although the presence of permafrost
   increased soil moisture contents, effects on microbial biomass and
   activity were limited to mineral soils that showed lower fungal biomass
   but higher activity compared with soils without permafrost. Fungal
   abundance and moisture were strong predictors of phenol oxidase enzyme
   activity in soil. Phenol oxidase enzyme activity, in turn, was linearly
   related to both C-13 lignin decomposition and microbial respiration in
   incubation studies. Taken together, these results indicate that
   reductions in fungal biomass in postfire soils and lower soil moisture
   in nonpermafrost soils reduced the potential of soil heterotrophs to
   decompose soil carbon. Although in the field increased rates of
   microbial respiration can be observed in postfire soils due to warmer
   soil conditions, reductions in fungal biomass and activity may limit
   rates of decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal (EM) basidiomycete fungi are obligate mutualists of
   pines and hardwoods that receive fixed C from the host tree. Though they
   often share most recent common ancestors with wood-rotting fungi, it is
   unclear to what extent EM fungi retain the ability to express enzymes
   that break down woody substrates. In this study, we tested the
   hypothesis that the dominant EM fungus in a pure pine system retains the
   ability to produce enzymes that break down woody substrates in a natural
   setting, and that this ability is inducible by reduction of host
   photosynthetic potential via partial defoliation. To achieve this, pines
   in replicate blocks were defoliated 50\% by needle removal, and enzyme
   activities were measured in individual EM root tips that had been
   treated with antibiotics to prevent possible bacterial activity. Results
   indicate that the dominant EM fungal species (Suillus granulatus)
   expressed all enzymes tested (endocellulase D-glucosidase, laccase,
   manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, phosphatase and protease), and
   that activities of these enzymes increased significantly (P < 0.001) in
   response to defoliation. Thus, this EM fungus (one of the more
   specialized mutualists of pine) has the potential to play a significant
   role in C, N and P cycling in this forested ecosystem. Therefore, many
   above-ground factors that reduce photosynthetic potential or divert
   fixed C from roots may have wide-reaching ecosystem effects.}},

Abstract = {{Tree girdling has been experimentally used to stop the allocation of
   carbohydrates from the canopy to tree roots and their associated
   ectomycorrhizal (EM) mycelia. We used three already established girdling
   experiments in northern Sweden, one in a Pinus sylvestris stand and two
   in Picea abies stands, to determine the effect of tree girdling on
   soil-living oribatid mites. These mites often feed on fungal hyphae, but
   it is not known to what extent they feed on EM or saprotrophic fungi. We
   hypothesised that a presumed decline in EM fungi after girdling would
   strongly reduce EM-feeding specialists and, correspondingly, reduce
   total abundance and species richness of oribatids in girdled plots. Tree
   girdling resulted in a significant decline in total abundance of
   oribatid mites in the two spruce stands, which was assumed to be linked
   to the decline in EM fungi, but not in the pine stand. Species richness
   decreased in girdled plots in one of the spruce forests. The decline in
   total abundance in girdled spruce stands was primarily dependent on a
   significant and consistent population decrease in Oppiella nova, which
   was the most abundant oribatid mite in the ungirdled spruce plots. Its
   abundance after girdling was only 8-18\% of that in ungirdled spruce
   plots. In the pine stand, O. nova had much lower abundance than in the
   spruce stands, and despite a tendency to decline in number after
   girdling also in the pine stand, it had a minor effect on total
   abundance. These results suggest that O. nova may be dependent on EM
   fungi in spruce forest soils, whereas the dependence on EM fungi in pine
   forest soils is less evident. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Significant effects of two fractions of alkali-extractable soil organic
   matter (AEOM) extracted from three different soils (agricultural soil,
   soil from deciduous forest, soil from spruce monoculture) on mycelial
   growth of 17 isolates of ectomycorrhizal fungi were observed. Growth of
   Lactarius deterrimus, Meliniomyces bicolor and one of the isolates of
   Leccinum aurantiacum was significantly stimulated by acid-insoluble
   fraction extracted from all three soils. The stimulatory effects were
   frequent but inhibition of mycelial growth of some isolates was also
   observed. The fungal response to the presence of the organic extract in
   the nutrient medium was isolate-specific rather than species-specific.
   organic matter extracted from different source soils affected
   differently the mycelial growth, the largest number of stimulatory
   effects being observed in an experiment where the extract was richest in
   trace the same time elements Zn and Cu. At the same time, the observed
   stimulatory effects were not attributable to increased concentrations of
   trace elements in the nutrient medium. The results indicate that soil

Abstract = {{We investigated microbial biomass, fungal biomass and microbial
   community structure at three altitudes (1000, 2000 and 3000 m) and in
   two soil layers {[}L/F layer (Layer I) and underlying H/Ah layer (Layer
   II)] of tropical mountain rain forests in southern Ecuador. Basal
   respiration, microbial biomass and concentration of ergosterol generally
   declined from Layer I to Layer II and peaked at 2000 m. Compared to
   temperate forest ecosystems microbial biomass and ergosterol
   concentrations were generally low. Patterns in phospholipid fatty acids
   indicated that the composition of microbial communities markedly changed
   from Layer I to Layer II. These differences between layers decreased
   with increasing altitude. The concentration of the arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungal marker PLFA 16:1 omega 5c decreased with altitude in
   Layer I but increased in Layer II. The fungal-to-bacterial ratio
   increased with altitude and was higher in Layer I than in Layer II.
   Presumably, low microbial biomass in soils of tropical forest ecosystems
   is due to high temperature associated with high respiration but also low
   litter quality, with the latter declining with altitude. These
   conclusions are supported by the fact that at higher altitude the
   microbial community changed from a bacterial-dominated to a
   fungal-dominated system. CCA showed that microbial biomass correlated
   closely with density of a number of putatively bacterial feeding testate
   amoeba species including Corythion dubium Taranek, 1871, Euglypha
   cristata Leidy, 1879, Trigonopyxis arcula Penard, 1912, Tracheleuglypha
   dentata Deflandre, 1928 and Trinema lineare Penard, 1890. Ergosterol
   concentrations, but not the PLFA 18:2 omega 6c, strongly correlated with
   the putatively fungal feeding species Phryganella acropodia (Hertwig,
   Lesser, 1874) Hopkinson, 1909. Generally, parallel to microbial biomass
   and ergosterol concentrations the density of testate amoebae peaked at
   2000 m. However, compared to microbial parameters changes in testate
   amoebae communities between two layers were less pronounced. The data
   suggest that density and community structure of testate amoebae are
   driven by the availability of food resources (bacteria and fungi) which
   at high altitude decrease with increasing moisture and decreasing pH.

Abstract = {{Different theories have been brought forward to explain the commonly
   observed delta N-15 enrichment with depth in soil profiles, including
   the discrimination against N-15 during N decomposition and the buildup
   of N-15-enriched microbial residues. A combination of soil organic
   matter (SOM) size and density fractionations, N-15 determinations, and
   phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses was conducted on soils from a
   pristine N-limited Nothofagus forest in southern Chile. The purpose of
   this study was to investigate which SOM fractions mostly reflect the
   N-15-enrichment pattern and to link N-15 SOM enrichment with microbial
   community composition. Nitrogen-15 enrichments were greater for the
   microaggregate (< 150 mu m) than for the macroaggregate (> 150 mu m)
   size fraction, with Rayleigh isotope enrichment factors averaging -8.5\%
   and -3.7\%, respectively. The macro-organic matter density fractions (>
   150 mu m) showed intermediate enrichment factors of -5.1\% and -7.3\%
   for the light (< 1.37 g cm-(3)) and heavy (> 1.37 g cm(-3)) fraction,
   respectively. The abundance of fungal and bacterial PLFAs was
   significantly higher in the microaggregate compared to the
   macroaggregate size fraction, but their relative abundance did not
   change between aggregate size fractions. Our data link differential N-15
   enrichment of SOM fractions to ``total{''} microbial abundance and, as
   such, corroborates existing theories of microbial-induced N-15
   enrichment. Isotopic fractionation during microbial N decomposition
   processes alone could not explain the large N-15 enrichment in the
   microaggregate size fraction (-8.5\%) and the heavy density fraction
   (-7.3\%). We therefore suggest that microbial turnover and accretion of
   N-15-enriched microbial (especially fungal) compounds was an additional
   driver for N-15 enrichment of this soil profile.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change will increase the recurrence of extreme weather events
   such as drought and heavy rainfall. Evidence suggests that extreme
   weather events pose threats to ecosystem functioning, particularly to
   nutrient cycling and biomass production. These ecosystem functions
   depend strongly on below-ground biotic processes, including the activity
   and interactions among plants, soil fauna, and micro-organisms. Here,
   experimental grassland and heath communities of three phytodiversity
   levels were exposed either to a simulated single drought or to a heavy
   rainfall event. Both weather manipulations were repeated for two
   consecutive years. The magnitude of manipulations imitated the local
   100-year extreme weather event. Heavy rainfall events increased
   below-ground plant biomass and stimulated soil enzyme activities as well
   as decomposition rates for both plant communities. In contrast, extreme
   drought did not reduce below-ground plant biomass and root length, soil
   enzyme activities, and cellulose decomposition rate. The low
   responsiveness of the measured ecosystem properties in face of the
   applied weather manipulations rendered the detection of significant
   interactions between weather events and phytodiversity impossible. Our
   data indicate on the one hand the close interaction between below ground
   plant parameters and microbial turnover processes in soil; on the other
   hand it shows that the plant-soil system can buffer against extreme
   drought events, at last for the period of investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Current theory expects that fungi, on the one hand, are spatially
   ubiquitous but, on the other, are more susceptible than bacteria to
   disturbance such as land use change due to dispersal limitations. This
   study examined the relative importance of location and land use effects
   in determining soil fungal community composition in south-eastern
   Australia. We use terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism
   (T-RFLP; primer pair ITS1-F-ITS4) and multivariate statistical methods
   (NMDS ordinations, ANOSIM tests) to compare relative similarities of
   soil fungal communities from nine sites encompassing three locations (ca
   50-200 km apart) and four land uses (native eucalypt forest, Pinus
   radiata plantation, Eucalyptus globulus plantation, and unimproved
   pasture). Location effects were generally weak (e.g. ANOSIM test
   statistic R <= 0.49) and were, in part, attributed to minor differences
   in soil texture. By contrast, we found clear and consistent evidence of
   land use effects on soil fungal community composition (R <= 0.95). That
   is, soils from sites of the same land use grouped together in NMDS
   ordinations of fungal composition despite geographic separations of up
   to ca 175 km (native eucalypt forests) and 215 km (P. radiata
   plantations). In addition, different land. uses from the same location
   were clearly separate in NMDS ordinations, despite, in one case, being
   just 180 m apart and having similar land use histories (i.e. P. radiata
   versus E. globulus plantation both established on pasture in the
   previous decade). Given negligible management of all sites beyond the
   early establishment phase, we attribute much of the land use effects to
   changes in dominant plant species based on consistent evidence elsewhere
   of strong specificity in pine and eucalypt mycorrhizal associations. In
   addition, weak to moderate correlations between soil fungal community
   composition and soil chemical variables (e.g. Spearman rank correlation
   coefficients for individual variables of 0.08-0.32), indicated a minor
   contributing role of vegetation-mediated changes in litter and soil
   chemistry. Our data provide evidence of considerable plasticity in soil
   fungal community composition over time spans as short as 6-11 years.
   This suggests that - at least within geographic zones characterised by
   more-or-less contiguous forest cover - soil fungal community composition
   depends most on availability of suitable habitat because dispersal
   propagules are readily available for colonisation after land use change.

Abstract = {{We assessed the degree to which ectomycorrhizal fungi exploit organic

   Thus, the sporocarps and associated mycorrhizal mycelium appeared to

Abstract = {{Aphyllophoraceous fungi are expected to reflect changes in the

   survey of aphyllophoraceous species in five forest types (undisturbed

   between fungal community composition and the environmental variables
   (canopy openness, soil water potential, amount and composition of coarse
   woody debris, litter mass, basal area, plant species composition). A
   total of 155 samples from 67 species were collected during the study
   period. The fungal species density represented by the number of species
   in a transect differed significantly among forest types. The fungal
   species density increased significantly with increasing number of pieces
   of coarse woody debris (CWD), but decreased significantly with
   increasing the scores of second axis of principal component analysis
   (PCA) for plant species composition. In the CCA ordination, automatic
   forward selection revealed that only the number of pieces of CWD
   significantly affected the fungal species composition. The occurrences
   of Flabellophora licmophora, Coriolopsis retropicta, Microporus
   vernicipes, and Amauroderma subrugosum were positively correlated with
   the number of pieces of CWD. Our study clearly demonstrated that forest

   that the quantity of CWD would be an important determinant of fungal

Abstract = {{In this study, we explore two mycorrhizal groups during development of
   riparian soils along a freely-flowing river. We provide the first
   documentation of a shift in abundance between arbuscular mycorrhizae and
   ectomycorrhizae during floodplain succession. We used a chronosequence
   spanning 0-70 yr along a river in northwestern Montana, USA, to test the
   hypothesis that abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is
   greatest in early stages of soil development, and abundance of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF) is greatest later in floodplain succession.
   We also measured the AMF-mediated process of formation of soil
   aggregates during site development. AMF colonization of the dominant
   tree (black cottonwood, Populus trichocarpa) remained low (< 5\%), while
   AMF colonization of understory species was high (45-90\%), across the
   chronosequence. Mycorrhizal inoculum potential (MIP) and hyphal length
   of AMF in soil peaked within the first 13 yr of succession and then
   declined. No single variable significantly correlated with AMF
   abundance, but AMF tended to decline as litter and soil organic matter
   increased. Density of ectomycorrhizal root tips in soil increased
   linearly throughout the chronosequence, and ectomycorrhizal colonization
   of cottonwood roots increased rapidly in early stages of succession.
   These patterns suggest that ECMF are not limited by dispersal, but
   rather influenced by abundance of host plants. Formation of water stable
   aggregates increased rapidly during the first third of the
   chronosequence, which was the period of greatest AMF abundance in the
   soil. The peak in AMF infectivity and hyphal length during early
   succession suggests that regular flooding and establishment of new sites
   promotes AMF abundance in this ecosystem. Regulation of rivers that
   eliminates creation of new sites may reduce contributions of AMF to
   riparian areas.}},

Abstract = {{Grassland afforestation with coniferous trees, occurring in many parts
   of the world, can greatly affect the nature and transformation of soil
   organic matter and associated nutrients, including phosphorus (P). This
   review critically examines the shifts in soil P availability and
   chemical nature, microbial properties and soil quality, and possible
   mechanisms involved in the changes in P nature and transformation as a
   result of grassland afforestation, based on the published and
   unpublished data from investigations carried out in recent years.
   Grassland afforestation with coniferous trees is found to enhance
   mineralization of organic matter and associated P and consequently
   improve P availability in topsoil. This is attributed to a combination
   of factors including the greater P demand and uptake by trees, the
   improved solubility of organic P by root and microbial exudates (e.g.
   low molecular weight organic acids), greater tree root phosphatase
   activity associated with ectomycorrhizae, and favourable soil moisture
   and temperature conditions. In addition, grassland afforestation also
   modifies the chemical nature of soil organic P, with a decrease of
   inositol phosphates (including myo- and scyllo-inositol
   hexakisphosphate) in soil under forest compared with grassland. On the
   other hand, grassland afforestation leads to lower soil microbial
   biomass carbon (C) and P, soil respiration and phosphatase activity,
   indicating a decrease in soil biological fertility. This may be
   associated with lower and less labile organic inputs into the mineral
   soil under coniferous forest compared with grassland and other chemical
   changes (e.g. lower soil pH) due to grassland afforestation. Future
   studies should focus on quantifying root and leaf litter inputs and
   turnover, characterization of the source, chemical composition and role
   of organic acids in the solubilization and hydrolysis of organic P using
   isotopic tracing and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques,
   assessment of shifts in the composition, activity and function of the
   soil microbial biomass in relation to grassland afforestation using
   appropriate molecular techniques, and comparative study on particular

Abstract = {{Mineral stress (nutrient deficiency and (or) ion toxicity) is a
   widespread phenomenon in forests around the world. However, with the
   exception of N limitation, its significance is often under appreciated.
   On weathered, acidic soils that support many of the world's forests, P,
   Ca, and Mg deficiencies and toxicities of Al and Mn are important
   constraints to forest productivity. Nutrient resources are a primary
   controller of forest function and structure and have important trophic
   implications, because foliar nutrient status is an important determinant
   of leaf palatability and consumer fitness. Nutrient acquisition and
   utilization in forest ecosystems is strongly influenced by environmental
   factors, which are changing at unprecedented rates with regional and
   global climate shifts. Here we examine nutrient limitations common to
   temperate, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) dominated forests as a
   model for understanding how climatic factors influence the acquisition
   and utilization of nutrient resources in forest ecosystems. In general,
   foliar nutrient imbalances created by soil weathering and acidification
   impair sugar maple physiology and correlate with health decline
   symptoms. Extremes in light environment, temperature, precipitation,
   pathogen attack, and herbivory tend to induce and (or) negatively
   interact with nutrient imbalances in sugar maple. A conceptual model is
   presented that characterizes abiotic and biotic interactions influencing
   sugar maple health and fitness in the context of nutrient limitation.}},

Abstract = {{Microbes are the unseen majority in soil and comprise a large portion of
   life's genetic diversity. Despite their abundance, the impact of soil
   microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we
   explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial
   ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant
   productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of
   plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant
   symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients.
   Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria are responsible for c.
   5-20\% (grassland and savannah) to 80\% (temperate and boreal forests)
   of all nitrogen, and up to 75\% of phosphorus, that is acquired by
   plants annually. Free-living microbes also strongly regulate plant
   productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for,
   nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including
   microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community
   dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some
   cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates
   suggest that c. 20 000 plant species are completely dependent on
   microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance
   of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth.
   Overall, this review shows that soil microbes must be considered as
   important drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{The mycelia of saprotrophic (SP) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi occur
   throughout the upper soil horizons in coniferous forests and could
   therefore be exposed to high concentrations of monoterpenes occurring in
   the needle litter of some tree species.
   Monoterpenes are mycotoxic and could potentially affect fungi that are
   exposed to them in the litter layers. In order to investigate whether
   monoterpenes typical of coniferous litters could influence fungal
   communities, we analysed the monoterpene content of freshly fallen
   needles of Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Picea sitchensis. The most
   abundant monoterpenes were found to be alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and
   3-carene. We evaluated the effects of these three monoterpene vapours on
   the biomass production of 23 SP isolates and 16 ECM isolates. Overall,
   75\% of ECM isolates and 26\% of SP isolates were significantly
   inhibited by at least one of the monoterpene treatments and both intra-
   and inter-specific variations in response were observed.
   Monoterpene concentrations are highest in surface litters. The
   differential effects on fungal taxa may influence the spatial and
   temporal distribution of fungal community composition, indirectly
   affecting decomposition and nutrient cycling, the fundamental ecosystem
   processes in which fungi have a key role in coniferous forest soils. (c)

Abstract = {{Controls on the colonization and abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi (AMF) in ecosystems are little understood and may be related

   a negative correlation between increases in black cottonwood (Populus
   trichocarpa) litter and AMF abundance and inoculum potential along a
   riparian chronosequence in northwest Montana. From this, we hypothesized
   that litter inputs negatively affect the native AMF community and may
   contribute to the shift between AM F and ectomycorrhizas. We tested the
   effects of cottonwood foliage and litter extract additions on the
   colonization of AMF of both cottonwood and Sudan grass (Sorghum
   sudanese) seedlings. Addition of 5\% (v/v) dried cottonwood leaves
   completely inhibited AMF colonization of S. sudanese. AMF colonization
   of S. sudanese was significantly reduced by litter extract of P.
   trichocarpa foliage, and colonization was negatively correlated with
   litter extract concentrations. Additions of aqueous litter extract
   significantly reduced AM F colonization of cottonwood seedlings as well.
   The effect of the litter extract on AM F colonization of S. sudanese did
   not appear to be mediated by changes in soil pH or plant biomass.
   Available phosphorus was higher in soil receiving highest concentration
   of litter extract, but not at a level expected to be inhibitory to AM F
   colonization. Litter additions significantly increased total soil
   phenolics, but with a range similar to natural soils of the Nyack
   foodplain. We tested pure soluble phenolic compounds common to Populus

Abstract = {{On a global basis, peatlands are a major reserve of carbon (C).
   Hydrological changes can affect the decomposition processes in peatlands
   and in turn can alter their C balance. Since 1959, a groundwater
   extraction plant has generated a water-level gradient at our study site
   that has gradually changed part of the wet fen into a dry peatland
   forest. The average water-level drawdown of the gradient (from a
   pristine 9 cm to 26 cm in the dry end) is close to an estimate predicted
   by an increase in mean global temperature of 3 degrees C. We studied the
   total microbial community of the aerobic surface peat in four locations
   along the gradient through phospholipid fatty acid and PCR-DGGE methods.
   Additionally, field measurements of soil respiration showed a threefold
   increase in the C-emission rate at the driest location compared with the
   wettest one, indicating enhanced decomposition. Also, both fungal and
   bacterial biomass increased in the drier locations. At the species
   level, the fungal community changed due to water-level drawdown whereas
   actinobacteria were less sensitive to drying. The majority of fungal
   sequences were similar to ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which dominated
   throughout the gradient. Our results indicate that ECM fungi might act
   as important facultative decomposers in organic-rich environments such
   as peatlands.}},

Abstract = {{We warmed the top soil of a mature coniferous forest stand by means of
   heating cables on control and trenched plots within 24 h by 10 degrees C
   at 1 cm soil depth (9 degrees C at 5 cm depth) and measured the effect
   on the autotrophic (R-A) and heterotrophic (R-H) component of total soil
   CO2 efflux (R-S). The short time frame of warming enabled us to exclude
   confounding fluctuations in soil moisture and carbon (C) flow from the
   canopy. The results of the field study were backed up by a lab soil
   incubation experiment. During the first 12 h of warming, R-A strongly
   responded to soil warming; The Q(10) values were 5.61 and 6.29 for 1 and
   5 cm soil depth temperature. The Q(10) values for R-A were almost twice
   as high as the Q(10) values of R-H (3.04 and 3.53). Q(10) values above 5
   are above reasonable plant physiological values for root respiration. We
   see interactions of roots, mycorrhizae and heterotrophic microbes,
   combined with fast substrate supply to the rhizosphere as an explanation
   for the high short-term temperature response of R-A. When calculated
   over the whole duration (24 h) of the field soil-warming experiment,
   temperature sensitivities of R-A and R-H were similar (no significant
   difference at P < 0.05); Q(10) values were 3.16 and 3.96 for R-A and
   2.94 and 3.35 for R-H calculated with soil temperatures at 1 and 5 cm
   soil depth, respectively. Laboratory incubation showed that different
   soil moisture contents of trenched and control plots affected rates of
   R-H, but did not affect the temperature sensitivity of R-H. We conclude
   that a single parameter is sufficient to describe the temperature
   sensitivity of R-S in soil C models which operate on larger temporal and
   spatial scales. The strong short-term response of R-A may be of
   relevance in soils suspected to experience increasingly strong diurnal
   temperature variations.}},

   negatively affected by fertilization than fungal growth rates, while
   fungal biomass (estimated using the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) 18:2

Abstract = {{Fungi are primary agents of organic matter decomposition in forests.
   Although invertebrate grazing affects fungal biomass and morphology, the
   species-specific consequences of these interactions are little
   understood. Using three collembola species (Folsomia candida,
   Protaphorura armata, Proisotoma minuta) we employed a multi-trophic
   approach to investigate the individual effects of invertebrate grazing
   on four species of saprotrophic basidiomycete fungi growing in two
   species (one fungus: one collembola) soil microcosms. We studied these
   effects at three trophic levels: the rate of wood decay brought about by
   the fungi was assessed; fungal growth was characterized across multiple
   time points using a range of image analysis parameters (radial
   extension, hyphal coverage, fractal dimension); and collembola abundance
   was determined at the end of the experiment. Collembola species had
   different impacts both within and across fungal species; F. candida had
   the greatest effect on fungal mycelia whereas P. armata often had little
   impact. Fungal species varied in their resilience to grazing; all
   collembola species modified Phanerochaete velutina and Hypholoma
   fasciculare morphology, that of Resinicium bicolor was only markedly
   affected by F. candida, and effects on Phallus impudicus were
   negligible. In the case of H. fasciculare, these grazing effects
   translated into effects on the rate of fungus-induced wood decay: F
   candida and P. armata, but not P. minuta, reduced wood decay rate
   compared to ungrazed controls. Rate of wood decay was unaffected in the
   other three fungal species. Changes in collembola population size were
   generally consistent across fungal species, with each species achieving
   a greater abundance on P. velutina than on H. fasciculare and P.
   impudicus. The collembola species did, however, respond differently to
   R. bicolor, with F. candida being more successful than P. armata. Our
   study suggests that a wide range of impacts can occur during
   fungus-collembola interactions, and that caution should be exercised
   when treating saprotrophic fungi and mycophagous collembola as uniform
   functional components. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) tends to limit plant productivity on young soils;

Abstract = {{The mechanism behind the (13)C enrichment of fungi relative to plant
   materials is unclear and constrains the use of stable isotopes in
   studies of the carbon cycle in soils.
   Here, we examined whether isotopic fractionation during respiration
   contributes to this pattern by comparing delta(13)C signatures of
   respired CO(2), sporocarps and their associated plant materials, from 16
   species of ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic fungi collected in a Norway
   spruce forest.
   The isotopic composition of respired CO(2) and sporocarps was positively
   correlated. The differences in delta(13)C between CO(2) and sporocarps
   were generally small, < +/- 1 parts per thousand in nine out of 16
   species, and the average shift for all investigated species was 0.04
   parts per thousand. However, when fungal groups were analysed
   separately, three out of six species of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes
   respired (13)C-enriched CO(2) (up to 1.6 parts per thousand), whereas
   three out of five species of polypores respired (13)C-depleted CO(2) (up
   to 1.7 parts per thousand; P < 0.05). The CO(2) and sporocarps were
   always (13)C-enriched compared with wood, litter or roots.
   Loss of (13)C-depleted CO(2) may have enriched some species in (13)C.
   However, that the CO(2) was consistently (13)C-enriched compared with
   plant materials implies that other processes must be found to explain
   the consistent (13)C-enrichment of fungal biomass compared with plant

Abstract = {{The establishment and subsequent impacts of invasive plant species often
   involve interactions or feedbacks with the below-ground subsystem. We
   compared the performance of planted tree seedlings and soil communities
   in three ectomycorrhizal tree species at Craigieburn, Canterbury, New
   Zealand - two invasive species (Pseudotsuga menziesii, Douglas-fir;
   Pinus contorta, lodgepole pine) and one native (Nothofagus solandri var.
   cliffortioides, mountain beech) - in monodominant stands. We studied
   mechanisms likely to affect growth and survival, i.e. nutrient
   competition, facilitation of carbon and nutrient transfer through
   mycorrhizal networks, and modification of light and soil conditions by
   canopy trees. Seedlings were planted in plastic tubes filled with local
   soil, and placed in monospecific stands. Effects of root competition
   from trees and mycorrhizal connections on seedling performance were
   tested by root trenching and use of tubes with or without a fine mesh
   (20 mu m), allowing mycorrhizal hyphae (but not roots) to pass through.
   Survival and growth were highest in stands of Nothofagus and lowest
   under Pseudotsuga. Surprisingly, root trenching and mesh treatments had
   no effect on seedling performance, indicating canopy tree species
   affected seedling performance through reduced light availability and
   altered soil conditions rather than below-ground suppression from root
   competition or mycorrhizal facilitation. Seedlings in Pseudotsuga stands
   had lower mycorrhizal colonisation, likely as a result of the lower
   light levels. Soil organic matter levels, microbial biomass, and
   abundance and diversity of microbe-consuming nematodes were all highest
   under Nothofagus, and nematode community assemblages differed strongly
   between native and non-native stand types. The negative effects of
   non-native trees on nematodes relative to Nothofagus are likely due to
   the lower availability of soil organic matter and microbial biomass in
   these stands, and therefore lower availability of resources for
   nematodes. This study shows that established stands of non-native
   invasive tree species may adversely affect tree seedlings and soil
   communities through modifications of the microenvironment both above and
   below ground. As such, invasion and domination of new landscapes by
   these species is likely to result in fundamental shifts in community-
   and ecosystem-level properties relative to those under native forest
   cover.}},

Abstract = {{Tannins are plant-derived polyphenolic compounds that precipitate

   determine if they would affect recovery of soluble soil carbon (WSC) or
   -nitrogen (WSN) or influence the extraction and composition of
   Bradford-reactive soil protein (BRSP), associated with glomalin. Tannic
   acid-C added with water was not completely recovered from samples and
   the amount of total net WSC and WSN recovered was reduced, suggesting
   formation of insoluble complexes. By comparison, non-tannin phenolics
   like gallic acid, or methyl gallate. had little effect on extraction of
   WSC or WSN while a simple gallotannin derived from tannic acid,
   1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-D-glucose (PGG), inhibited extraction most.
   The C and N concentrations in BRSP increased when soil samples were

   models have incorporated a representation of allelopathy, but its
   inclusion should be considered in forest models dealing with
   environmental stress, exotic plant invasions and ecological succession.
   Multiple factors influence allelochemical production and toxicity,
   including nutrient availability, soil moisture and texture, solar
   radiation, and temperature. Ecosystem-level effects of allelopathy
   include changes in germination rates, inhibition of seedling growth,
   mycorrhizal function, insect and bacterial growth, inhibition of
   nitrification or litterfall decomposition and dieback of mature trees.
   To illustrate some potential consequences of incorporation some aspects
   of allelopathy, in an ecosystem-level model, a virtual experiment was
   carried out with the forest ecosystem-level model FORECAST. This
   revealed different effects of allelopathy on several ecological
   variables depending on the type of allelopathic influence simulated. In
   addition, this experiment showed the utility of ecosystem-level models
   to simulate, if not directly the allelopathic interactions, at least the
   ecological effects of allelopathy at the ecosystem level. Overall, my
   work points out that researchers and forest managers should think
   carefully about the need to include allelopathy as a way of improving
   the accuracy of forest models and ecosystem-based decision support

Abstract = {{Beneficial soil microorganisms are integral to nutrient availability and
   uptake for plants in restoration. They include mycorrhizal fungi and
   nitrogen-fixing bacteria, together with the soil microbial populations
   which contribute to nutrient availability. Around 70\% of jarrah forest
   plant species form arbuscular mycorrhizas, and approximately a quarter
   also form ectomycorrttizas. Many are also legumes. In addition, around
   70 orchid species depend on mycorrhizal symbioses. Therefore, symbiotic
   soil microorganisms are important in the ecosystem. Arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi recover to pre-mining levels in bauxite restoration in
   five years. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are poorly adapted to disturbance;
   however, they are able to reinvade through wind-blown spores. The
   density of ectomycorrhizal fungi has been found to be equivalent in
   seven-year-old restoration and adjacent forest, but both abundance and
   diversity are correlated with development of a litter layer.
   Fortunately, rhizobia are known to be tolerant of soil disturbance, and
   failure of N-fixation by legumes has not been reported in restoration.
   Other N-fixing symbioses, such as between Allocasuarina and Frankia or
   Macrozamia and Nostoc, have not been investigated in restored mines.
   Soil microbial biomass C achieves near equivalence after about eight
   years and appears to be driven by vegetation productivity and related
   inputs of C into the soil. There is little field evidence that the
   absence, or very low levels, of soil microbial symbionts will have a
   substantial impact on plant growth in restoration. Therefore, deliberate
   reintroduction of these microorganisms does not appear justified.
   However, soil management to enhance the survival of soil biological
   components is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Microinvertebrate abundance was measured, together with forest soil
   properties and litter components in eight plots dominated by beech and
   birch during May to August 2001. The results were analysed using ANOVA,
   stepwise regression and correlation analysis. Both protozoa and
   nematodes were analysed according to their functional groups. The
   protozoa were flagellates, ciliates and naked amoebae, and the nematodes
   were microbial and plant feeding nematodes. Moisture levels were between
   28\% and 33\% in soil, and 50\% to 70\% in litter. Population numbers
   were very variable between sites and dates, and showed variable levels
   between May and July followed by a significant increase in August.
   ANOVA showed significant site and date effects, mainly in the litter.
   Stepwise regression models and correlation analysis revealed a number of
   interactions among separate groups of protozoa and nematodes, as well as
   their interrelations with fungi and bacteria. In addition, statistical
   analysis of soil data revealed a number of microfaunal relationships
   with soil pH, moisture and organic content, whilst in the field layer a
   number of significant interactions with specific forest litter fractions
   were found.
   The results have revealed particularly high levels of microfaunal
   abundance in the litter fraction compared to the soil, with flagellates
   and microbial feeding nematodes showing the highest levels among the
   trophic groups studied. These data compare well with other studies in
   similar ecosystems. The invertebrates present appear to be concentrated
   in hotspots of biological activity. In soil, they may predominantly have
   been confined to the rhizosphere. In the litter, their numbers may have
   been enhanced by nutrient availability, which may have increased
   throughout the study period owing to the gradual progress of
   decomposition facilitated by the combination of faunal, bacterial and
   fungal activity.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotope ratios of terrestrial ecosystem nitrogen (N) pools
   reflect internal processes and input-output balances. Disturbance
   generally increases N cycling and loss, yet few studies have examined
   ecosystem delta N-15 over a disturbance-recovery sequence. We used a
   chronosequence approach to examine N distribution and delta N-15 during
   forest regrowth after agricultural abandonment. Site ages ranged from 10
   to 115 years, with similar soils, climate, land-use history, and
   overstory vegetation (white pine Pinus strobus). Foliar N and delta N-15
   decreased as stands aged, consistent with a progressive tightening of
   the N cycle during forest regrowth on agricultural lands. Over time,
   foliar delta N-15 became more negative, indicating increased
   fractionation along the mineralization-mycorrhizal-plant uptake pathway.
   Total ecosystem N was constant across the chronosequence, but
   substantial internal N redistribution occurred from the mineral soil to
   plants and litter over 115 years (> 25\% of ecosystem N or 1,610 kg
   ha(-1)). Temporal trends in soil delta N-15 generally reflected a
   redistribution of depleted N from the mineral soil to the developing O
   horizon. Although plants and soil delta N-15 are coupled over millennial
   time scales of ecosystem development, our observed divergence between
   plants and soil suggests that they can be uncoupled during the
   disturbance-regrowth sequence. The approximate 2 parts per thousand
   decrease in ecosystem delta N-15 over the century scale suggests
   significant incorporation of atmospheric N, which was not detected by
   traditional ecosystem N accounting. Consideration of temporal trends and
   disturbance legacies can improve our understanding of the influence of
   broader factors such as climate or N deposition on ecosystem N balances
   and delta N-15.}},

Abstract = {{Fungi play a central role in the nutrient cycles of boreal and temperate
   forests. In these biomes, the saprotrophic wood-decay fungi are the only
   organisms that can completely decompose woody plant litter. In
   particular, cord-forming basidiomycete fungi form extensive mycelial
   networks that scavenge scarce mineral nutrients and translocate them
   over long distances to exploit new food resources. Despite the
   importance of resource allocation, there is limited information on
   nutrient dynamics in these networks, particularly for nitrogen, as there
   is no suitable radioisotope available. We have mapped N-translocation
   using photon-counting scintillation imaging of the nonmetabolised amino
   acid analogue, C-14-aminoisobutyrate. We describe a number of novel
   phenomena, including rapid, preferential N-resource allocation to Grich
   sinks, induction of simultaneous bi-directional N-transport, abrupt
   switching between different pre-existing transport routes, and emergence
   of locally synchronised, oscillatory phase domains. It is possible that

   fraction), or acid-unhydrolyzable residue. Observed differences in
   average wood property values between decay stages and between young and
   old-growth stands were small and, although statistically significant,
   may not reflect an important difference in EM fungal habitat. EM
   communities were similar between young and old-growth stands and between

Abstract = {{We have much to learn about the roles of various groups of soil
   microorganisms in the decomposition of soil organic matter. Any changes
   in the type or amount of organic matter entering the soil, due to
   increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition and elevated carbon
   dioxide, could directly affect soil microbial community structure or the
   decompositional functions performed by the various microbial groups. We
   experimentally altered soil microbial communities using a factorial
   combination of trenching and in-growth bags crossed with fertilization
   treatments consisting of two forms of inorganic N and three N-containing
   organic molecules of increasing molecular weight and complexity. We
   tested three hypotheses: (1) Different components of soil microbial
   communities change in different ways following the application of
   fertilization treatments; (2) soil fungi decrease with increased
   inorganic N but increase following the application of organic molecules;
   and (3) activity of the extracellular enzymes peroxidase and phenol
   oxidase, which are important in lignin degradation, decrease following
   the addition of inorganic N. We found that the abundance of soil
   microbes and their composition (measured by lipid analysis) was
   significantly altered following the addition of glutamic acid, but not
   with inorganic N or more complex N-containing organic molecules. Lipids
   indicative of ectomycorrhizat fungi experienced the greatest increase in
   abundance. Extracellular enzyme activity, in contrast, changed very
   little and did not parallel changes in the structure of the soil
   microbial community that resulted from the isolation treatments. We
   conclude that small additions of N-containing organic compounds can
   cause changes in the structure of the soil microbial community but that
   community changes do not necessarily have an impact on extracellular

Abstract = {{How resource availabilities affect the competitiveness of Canada
   bluejoint grass {[}Calamagrostis canadensis (Michx.) P. Beauv.,
   hereafter referred to as bluejoint] is poorly understood. Bluejoint is a
   widespread grass species in boreal forests and competes with tree
   species such as white spruce {[}Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] for
   belowground resources (e.g., soil N and water) when their supply is
   limited. In this green house-based study, we tested the following
   hypotheses: (i) bluejoint competition reduces white spruce growth when
   belowground resource availabilities are limited; (ii) greater N and
   water availabilities may increase bluejoint competition and its adverse
   effects on white spruce growth; and (iii) white spruce foliar delta C-13
   and delta N-15 are affected by soil N and water availabilities and
   bluejoint competition. A 2 x 2 x 2 (competition x N availability x water
   availability) factorial experiment was conducted using pots of planted
   white spruce seedlings with or without bluejoint. Bluejoint competition
   reduced the volume index (diameter(2) x height) of white spruce by 50\%.
   The competitiveness of bluejoint appeared to be independent of resource
   availabilities, but bluejoint had greater growth response to increased N
   availability than white spruce. Bluejoint competition depleted white
   spruce foliar delta C-13 and delta N-15 by 1.2 and 1.2\%o, respectively,
   even under adequate water supply, indicating that N deficiency caused by
   bluejoint competition had a C-13 discrimination during photosynthesis)
   compared with the potential effect of drought stress on foliar delta
   C-13, and that strong NH4 uptake by bluejoint may have prevented
   significant soil N losses and N-15 enrichment through nitrification and
   subsequent denitrification.}},

Abstract = {{Mixtures of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and Acacia mearnsii de Wildeman
   are twice as productive as E. globulus monocultures growing on the same
   site in East Gippsland, Victoria, Australia, possibly because of
   increased nitrogen (N) availability owing to N(2) fixation by A.
   mearnsii. To investigate whether N(2) fixation by A. mearnsii could
   account for the mixed-species growth responses, we assessed N(2)
   fixation by the accretion method and the 15 N natural abundance method.
   Nitrogen gained by E. globulus and A. mearnsii mixtures and monocultures
   was calculated by the accretion method with plant and soil samples
   collected 10 years after plantation establishment. Nitrogen in biomass
   and soil confirmed that A. meamsii influenced N dynamics. Assuming that
   the differences in soil, forest floor litter and biomass N of plots
   containing A. mearnsii compared with E. globulus monocultures were due
   to N(2) fixation, the 10-year annual mean rates of N(2) fixation were 38
   and 86 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in 1: 1 mixtures and A. mearnsii monocultures,
   respectively. Nitrogen fixation by A. mearnsii could not be quantified
   on the basis of the natural abundance of 15 N because such factors as
   mycorrhization type and fractionation of N isotopes during N cycling
   within the plant confounded the effect of the N source on the N isotopic
   signature of plants. This study shows that A. mearnsii fixed significant
   quantities of N(2) when mixed with E. globulus. A decline in delta(15)N
   values of E. globulus and A. mearnsii with time, from 2 to 10 years, is
   further evidence that N(2) was fixed and cycled through the stands. The
   increased aboveground biomass production of E. globutus trees in
   mixtures when compared with monocultures can be attributed to increases
   in N availability.}},

Abstract = {{Forest ecosystems are important sinks for rising concentrations of
   atmospheric CO2. In previous research, we showed that net primary
   production (NPP) increased by 23 +/- 2\% when four experimental forests
   were grown under atmospheric concentrations of CO2 predicted for the
   latter half of this century. Because nitrogen (N) availability commonly
   limits forest productivity, some combination of increased N uptake from
   the soil and more efficient use of the N already assimilated by trees is
   necessary to sustain the high rates of forest NPP under free-air CO2
   enrichment (FACE). In this study, experimental evidence demonstrates
   that the uptake of N increased under elevated CO2 at the Rhinelander,
   Duke, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory FACE sites, yet fertilization
   studies at the Duke and Oak Ridge National Laboratory FACE sites showed
   that tree growth and forest NPP were strongly limited by N availability.
   By contrast, nitrogen-use efficiency increased under elevated CO2 at the
   POP-EUROFACE site, where fertilization studies showed that N was not
   limiting to tree growth. Some combination of increasing fine root
   production, increased rates of soil organic matter decomposition, and
   increased allocation of carbon (C) to mycorrhizal fungi is likely to
   account for greater N uptake under elevated CO2. Regardless of the
   specific mechanism, this analysis shows that the larger quantities of C
   entering the below-ground system under elevated CO2 result in greater N
   uptake, even in N-limited ecosystems. Biogeochemical models must be
   reformulated to allow C transfers below ground that result in additional
   N uptake under elevated CO2.}},

Abstract = {{We report the effects of pine and oak litter on species composition and
   diversity of mycorrhizal fungi colonizing 2-year-old Pinus sylvestris L.
   seedlings grown in a bare-root nursery in Lithuania. A layer of pine or
   oak litter was placed on the surface of the nursery bed soil to mimic
   natural litter cover. Oak litter amendment appeared to be most favorable
   for seedling survival, with a 73\% survival rate, in contrast to the
   untreated mineral bed soil (44\%). The concentrations of total N, P, K,
   Ca, and Mg were higher in oak growth medium than in pine growth medium.
   Relative to the control (pH 6.1), the pH was lower in pine growth medium
   (5.8) and higher in oak growth medium (6.3). There were also twofold and
   threefold increases in the C content of growth medium with the addition
   of pine and oak litter, respectively. Among seven mycorrhizal
   morphotypes, eight different mycorrhizal taxa were identified: Suillus
   luteus, Suillus variegatus, Wilcoxina mikolae, a Tuber sp., a Tomentella
   sp., Cenococcum geophilurn, Amphinema byssoides, and one unidentified
   ectomycorrhizal symbiont. Forest litter addition affected the relative
   abundance of mycorrhizal symbionts more than their overall
   representation. This was more pronounced for pine litter than for oak
   litter, with 40\% and 25\% increases in the abundance of suilloid
   mycorrhizae, respectively. Our findings provide preliminary evidence
   that changes in the supply of organic matter through litter manipulation
   may have far-reaching effects on the chemistry of soil, thus influencing
   the growth and survival of Scots pine seedlings and their mycorrhizal
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms behind the C-13 enrichment of organic matter with
   increasing soil depth in forests are unclear. To determine if C-13
   discrimination during respiration could contribute to this pattern, we
   compared delta C-13 signatures of respired CO2 from sieved mineral soil,
   litter layer and litterfall with measurements of delta C-13 and delta
   N-15 of mineral soil, litter layer, litterfall, roots and fungal mycelia
   sampled from a 68-year-old Norway spruce forest stand planted on
   previously cultivated land. Because the land was subjected to ploughing
   before establishment of the forest stand, shifts in delta C-13 in the
   top 20 cm reflect processes that have been active since the beginning of
   the reforestation process. As C-13-depleted organic matter accumulated
   in the upper soil, a 1.0 parts per thousand delta C-13 gradient from
   -28.5 parts per thousand in the litter layer to -27.6 parts per thousand
   at a depth of 2-6 cm was formed. This can be explained by the 1 parts
   per thousand drop in delta C-13 of atmospheric CO2 since the beginning
   of reforestation together with the mixing of new C (forest) and old C
   (farmland). However, the isotopic change of the atmospheric CO2 explains
   only a portion of the additional 1.0 parts per thousand increase in
   delta C-13 below a depth of 20 cm. The delta C-13 of the respired CO2
   was similar to that of the organic matter in the upper soil layers but
   became increasingly C-13 enriched with depth, up to 2.5 parts per
   thousand relative to the organic matter. We hypothesise that this C-13
   enrichment of the CO2 as well as the residual increase in delta C-13 of
   the organic matter below a soil depth of 20 cm results from the
   increased contribution of C-13-enriched microbially derived C with
   depth. Our results suggest that C-13 discrimination during microbial
   respiration does not contribute to the C-13 enrichment of organic matter
   in soils. We therefore recommend that these results should be taken into
   consideration when natural variations in delta C-13 of respired CO2 are
   used to separate different components of soil respiration or ecosystem
   respiration.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this paper is to study the interspecific
   variation of N-15 natural abundance in two dominant conifer tree
   species, Scot pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies
   L. Karst) in a N-limited mixed boreal coniferous forest in southern
   Finland. Both a mature tree stand (a natural forest stand) and a stand
   of seedlings in a clear-cut area were considered. We analyzed \%N and
   delta N-15 natural abundance in needles, branches, litter and soil of
   the both above-mentioned stands. Pine needles had higher N
   concentrations than spruce needles, both in mature forest (pine 1.09\%,
   SE +/- 0.02 and spruce = 0.79\%, SE +/- 0.02) and in the clear-cut area
   (pine = 1.01\%, SE +/- 0.07 and spruce 0.74\%, SE +/- 0.04).
   Furthermore, pine needles were significantly more depleted in delta N-15
   natural abundance than the spruce needles, both in the mature forest
   (pine = -5.6 parts per thousand, SE +/- 0.1 parts per thousand and
   spruce = -4.0 parts per thousand, SE +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) and in
   the clear-cut sites (pine = -2.8 parts per thousand, SE +/- 0.2 parts
   per thousand and spruce = -2.1 parts per thousand, SE +/- 0.3 parts per
   thousand). The more pronounced depletion of 15N in the pine foliage
   might be connected to its different fungal associates in the roots
   compared to spruce roots. We assume that the mycorrhizal N-uptake is
   very prominent at the N-limited site. After clear-cutting, needles of
   the seedlings and the uppermost part of soil organic layer were found to
   be more N-15-enriched than at the natural forest site. This was

Abstract = {{The species of an ectomycorrhizal (ECM) community were investigated in a

   ECM morphotypes were found at the site. The niche effect (as organic

   soil) on the ECM community structure and on the potential catabolic
   activities of the most abundant morphotypes was studied. The morphotypes
   in each niche were subjected to enzymatic tests developed for hydrolytic
   and oxidative enzymes involved in the decomposition of organic
   compounds. The ECM community structure varied widely depending on the
   soil horizon or habitat patch. The species richness was higher in the A
   I horizon than in the other niches. Different ECM species had different
   activity patterns for the eight enzymatic tests while co-occurring in
   the same niche. Catabolic activities also changed within species between
   niches. Dead woody debris were extensively colonized by two saprotrophic
   fungi (Megacollybia platyphylla and Armillaria sp.) and, in this
   particular niche, ECM morphotypes predominantly belonged to the genera
   Lactarius and Tomentella. These morphotypes showed high chitinase

Abstract = {{The lipid composition of Collembola and their potential food resources
   was assessed in three deciduous forest stands, in order to gain insight
   into food web linkages under field conditions. Fatty acids (FAs)
   previously assigned as trophic markers in laboratory experiments were
   used to investigate feeding strategies in situ. As potential food
   sources soil microbiota and plant debris were characterised by their
   phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition. Both the amount and the
   pattern of PLFAs differed between sites and soil depth, in particular
   the bacterial and plant marker FAs in the upper soil layer. Thus, the
   availability of resources for micro-detritivores varied due to forest
   and soil layer. The lipid composition of vital and senescent beech
   leaves was predominantly influenced by metabolic status and represented
   a quite homogenous FA resource across forest stands. Comparing Folsomia
   quadrioculata, Lepidocyrtus lignorum, Neanura muscorum and
   Pogonognathellus longicornis between the different forests revealed FA
   profiles to be predominantly affected by site, suggesting a diet shift
   depending on resources at hand. However, species-specific differences in
   individual FAs occurred, likely related to feeding strategy and
   physiological activity. Lipids of Collembola comprised low amounts of
   bacterial marker FAs, and bacterial consumption may occur to some
   extent, particularly on Gram-positives. The marker FA for predatory
   feeding, 20: 1 omega 9, was found in several species, although in low
   amounts. This contradicts known feeding habits and caution is advisable
   in using 20: 1 omega 9 as trophic marker. Overall, as indicated by high
   proportions of oleic (18: 1 omega 9) or linoleic (18: 2 omega 6, 9)
   acid, most species were either plant litter or fungal feeders, with some
   transitions. The ratio 18: 1 omega 9/18: 2 omega 6,9 is proposed as a
   tool to distinguish between these two major feeding strategies in
   Collembola. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The methodologies used for studying macrofungal communities are an
   eclectic assemblage of many different and unstandardized approaches. In
   this study we propose a simple, nondestructive but still informative
   method to assess fungal sporocarp biomass in forested areas. We use the
   number of fruiting bodies found in the surveyed plot, and data on cap
   diameter of the species from the literature to calculate a cap area
   index. We show that this index very strongly correlates with the
   measured total dry mass of the species obtained from the same plot. We
   point out that the cap area index provides a more accurate estimation of
   the epigeous fungal sporocarp biomass than do the species sporocarp
   numbers. This new methodology allows the spatiotemporal distribution of
   a fungal community in an ecosystem to be followed. Since sporocarp
   production responds much more sensitively to environmental changes than
   does the fine-root vegetative ectomycorrhizal community, it may more
   quickly reflect whether an ecosystem has been perturbed. It will also
   allow us to collect data on saprotrophic species. A sporocarp survey can
   be useful for detecting early changes in the habitat and environment,
   and give an easily applicable method for conservation biology and

Abstract = {{Polyphenols are capable of binding to proteins and form
   polyphenol-protein complexes thus reducing the release of N from
   decomposing plant materials. The objective of this work was to test if
   under polyphenol-rich vegetations adapted microbial communities had
   developed capable of breaking down recalcitrant polyphenol-protein
   complexes. Soils used for this investigation were from different
   10-year-old tropical agricultural systems (maize, sugarcane plots and
   Gliricidia sepium or Peltophorum dasyrrachis woodlots) and natural
   systems (secondary forest and Imperata cylindrica grassland). TA (tannic
   acid, hydrolysable tannin), QUE (quebracho, condensed tannin), BSA
   (bovine serum albumin, protein) or TA/BSA and QUE/BSA polyphenol-protein
   complexes were incubated at 28 degrees C in these soils. CO2-C and C-13
   evolution were periodically monitored and mineral N release, microbial
   biomass N and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles measured at the
   end.
   QUE was able to bind about 25\% more protein than TA. In all systems the
   individual uncomplexed substrates were more easily degraded than the
   complexes. On average, net cumulative CO2-C evolution from TA/BSA
   complexes was more than 5 times higher than from QUE/BSA complexes,
   indicating higher C availability and/or lower protection capability of
   TA compared to QUE. However, net N release was higher from QUE/BSA than
   from TA/BSA probably due to their higher protein-binding capacity and
   associated larger degradation of partly unprotected protein as suggested
   by C-13-CO2 signatures. Microbial respiration patterns indicated that
   polyphenol complexes were initially degraded more quickly in the maize
   cropping system than in soils from under polyphenol-rich communities
   (Peltophorum and natural forest) but this pattern reversed with time.
   Long-term incubation of QUE/BSA complexes even caused a negative effect
   on microbial respiration in agricultural soils with low polyphenol
   contents (e.g. maize and sugarcane).
   Incubation of polyphenol complexes in soil depressed microbial biomass N
   in maize, sugarcane, Imperata and forest systems and led to reduced soil
   pH. However, microbial biomass was increased under the polyphenol-rich
   vegetation of Peltophorum. The PLFA group 18:2w6,9 was highly enhanced
   by condensed tannin-protein complexes additions as compared to control
   and hydrolysable polyphenol-protein complexes in soils with high
   polyphenol contents. Polyphenol complexes increased the fungi:bacteria
   ratio in systems with a high polyphenol content, particularly with
   condensed tannin complexes. The results indicated that systems with a
   high polyphenol content favoured development of fungal communities that
   are highly adaptable to phenol-rich soil conditions and high acidity,
   particularly with regards to the more recalcitrant condensed
   tannin-protein complexes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is an important component in the
   terrestrial carbon cycle. Yet, the relative importance of different
   inputs of DOC to the soil solution remains uncertain. Here, we used a
   large-scale forest girdling experiment to examine how the supply of
   recent photosynthate to tree roots and their mycorrhizal fungi affects
   DOC, in particular low-molecular weight organic acids (LMWOA). We also
   studied effects of tree girdling on non-structural carbohydrates in
   microorganism, and examined the effects of freezing of soil and the
   presence of roots in the soil samples on soil solution DOC and LMWOA in
   this experiment. The concentration of DOC was reduced by 40\%, while
   citrate was reduced by up to 90\% in the soil solution by the girdling
   treatment. Other LMWOA such as oxalate, succinate, formate and
   propionate were unaffected by the girdling. We also found that girdling
   reduced the concentrations of trehalose (by 50\%), a typical fungal
   sugar, and of monosaccharides (by 40\%) in microorganisms in root-free
   soil. The effect of freezing on DOC concentrations was marked in samples
   from control plots, but insignificant in samples from girdled plots.
   Release of DOC from cell lysis after freezing was attributed equally to
   roots and to microorganisms. Our observations suggest a direct link from
   tree photosynthesis through roots and their mycorrhizal fungi to soil
   solution chemistry. This direct link should impact solute transport and
   speciation, mineral weathering and C dynamics in the soil compartment.
   Importantly, our finding of a substantial photosynthate driven
   production of DOC challenges the paradigm that DOC is mainly the result
   of decomposition of organic matter.}},

Title = {{Petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in boreal forest soils: a

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{213-240}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The importance of developing multi-disciplinary approaches to solving
   problems relating to anthropogenic pollution is now clearly appreciated
   by the scientific community, and this is especially evident in boreal
   ecosystems exposed to escalating threats of petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC)
   contamination through expanded natural resource extraction activities.
   This review aims to synthesize information regarding the fate and
   behaviour of PHCs in boreal forest soils in both ecological and
   sustainable management contexts. From this, we hope to evaluate
   potential management strategies, identify gaps in knowledge and guide
   future research. Our central premise is that mycorrhizal systems, the
   ubiquitous root symbiotic fungi and associated food-web communities,
   occupy the structural and functional interface between decomposition and
   primary production in northern forest ecosystems (i.e. underpin survival
   and productivity of the ecosystem as a whole), and, as such, are an
   appropriate focal point for such a synthesis. We provide pertinent basic
   information about mycorrhizas, followed by insights into the ecology of
   ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal systems. Next, we review the fate and
   behaviour of PHCs in forest soils, with an emphasis on interactions with
   mycorrhizal fungi and associated bacteria. Finally, we summarize
   implications for ecosystem management. Although we have gained
   tremendous insights into understanding linkages between ecosystem
   functions and the various aspects of mycorrhizal diversity, very little
   is known regarding rhizosphere communities in PHC-contaminated soils.
   This makes it difficult to translate ecological knowledge into
   environmental management strategies. Further research is required to
   determine which fungal symbionts are likely to survive and compete in
   various ecosystems, whether certain fungal - plant associations gain in
   ecological importance following contamination events, and how PHC
   contamination may interfere with processes of nutrient acquisition and
   exchange and metabolic processes. Research is also needed to assess
   whether the metabolic capacity for intrinsic decomposition exists in
   these ecosystems, taking into account ecological variables such as
   presence of other organisms (and their involvement in syntrophic
   biodegradation), bioavailability and toxicity of mixtures of PHCs, and
   physical changes to the soil environment.}},

Abstract = {{The fungal community of the forest floor was examined as the cause of
   previously reported increases in soil organic matter due to experimental
   N deposition in ecosystems producing predominantly high-lignin litter,
   and the opposite response in ecosystems producing low-lignin litter. The
   mechanism proposed to explain this phenomenon was that white-rot
   basidiomycetes are more important in the degradation of high-lignin
   litter than of low-lignin litter, and that their activity is suppressed
   by N deposition. We found that forest floor mass in the low-lignin
   sugar-maple dominated system decreased in October due to experimental N
   deposition, whereas forest floor mass of high-lignin oak-dominated
   ecosystems was unaffected by N deposition. Increased relative abundance
   of basidiomycetes in high-lignin forest floor was confirmed by
   denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing. Abundance
   of basidiomycete laccase genes, encoding an enzyme used by white-rot
   basidiomycetes in the degradation of lignin, was 5-10 times greater in
   high-lignin forest floor than in low-lignin forest floor. While the
   differences between the fungal communities in different ecosystems were
   consistent with the proposed mechanism, no significant effects of N
   deposition were detected on DGGE profiles, laccase gene abundance,
   laccase length heterogeneity profiles, or phenol oxidase activity. Our
   observations indicate that the previously detected accumulation of soil
   organic matter in the high-lignin system may be driven by effects of N
   deposition on organisms in the mineral soil, rather than on organisms
   residing in the forest floor. However, studies of in situ gene
   expression and temporal and spatial variability within forest floor
   communities will be necessary to further relate the ecosystem dynamics
   of organic carbon to microbial communities and atmospheric N deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Forest litter and soil may contain >10 X 10(6) individual nematodes
   center dot m(-2) and, regionally, >400 species. Root-feeding nematodes
   may be pathogenic to young plants; microbial-feeding nematodes may
   increase turnover of the microbial pool; predacious and omnivorous
   nematodes represent higher trophic levels. The spatial distribution and
   abundance of nematode species in forests reflect soil type, soil
   fertility, climate, canopy and understorey plant species, litter depth,
   forest age, and management. Nematodes may be important in forest
   nurseries; they occur throughout the rooting depth of forest trees;
   hyphal-feeding species may influence mycorrhizae; and insect-vectored
   Bursaphelenchus species are a quarantine risk. Nematode populations
   interact with those of other soil animals (e.g., mites, tardigrades,
   enchytraeids, and protozoa). The diversity and abundance of the nematode
   assemblage make nematodes a useful indicator of soil condition and soil
   processes. Information available from forest systems suggests that, as
   long as physical disturbance is minimized and remaining trees or herb
   layer moderate the microclimate, logging and other forestry operations
   have only transitory effects on nematode populations. Extreme
   disturbance, such as bulldozing and slash-and-burn management, can
   significantly reduce nematode abundance and diversity. In contrast,
   management that enhances growth of understorey or herb layer can
   stimulate nematode populations. Each of these changes can be related to
   changes in food resource availability and environmental conditions, such
   as soil temperature and moisture. Although details of soil nematode
   contributions to nutrient processes in forest soils are sparse, that
   their populations are maintained through cycles of moderate management
   practices suggest that their beneficial contributions will also be

Abstract = {{Orchids require mycorrhizal fungi for germination of seed and growth of
   seedlings. The colonisation of bauxitemine rehabilitation areas by
   orchids is therefore dependent on the availability of both seed and
   mycorrhizal fungi. Orchid mycorrhizal fungi baiting trialswere carried
   out in rehabilitation areas that were 1, 10 and 26 years old
   (established in 2001, 1992 and 1976) and adjacent unmined jarrah forest
   areas at Jarrahdale, Western Australia. Fungal baits consisted of buried
   six-chambered nylon-mesh packets containing seed of six jarrah forest
   orchid taxa, Caladenia. ava subsp.. ava R. Br., Disa bracteata Sw.,
   Microtis media subsp. media R. Br., Pterostylis recurva Benth.,
   Pyrorchis nigricans (R. Br.) D. L. Jones \& M. A. Clem. and Thelymitra
   crinita Lindl. Detection of orchid mycorrhizal fungi was infrequent,
   especially at the youngest rehabilitation sites where only mycorrhizal
   fungi associated with P. recurva were detected. Mycorrhizal fungi of the
   other orchid taxa were widespread but sparsely distributed in older
   rehabilitation and forest areas. Detection of mycorrhizal fungi varied
   between taxa and baiting sites for the two survey years (2002 and 2004).
   Caladenia. ava subsp.. ava and T. crinita mycorrhizal fungi were the
   most frequently detected. The presence of C.. ava mycorrhizal fungi was
   correlated with leafy litter cover and maximum depth, and soil moisture
   at the vegetation type scale (50 x 5m belt transects), as well as tree
   and litter cover at the microhabitat scale (1-m(2) quadrats). The
   presence of T. crinita mycorrhizal fungi was positively correlated with
   soil moisture in rehabilitation areas and low shrub cover in forest. The
   frequency of detection of orchid mycorrhizal fungi both at rehabilitated
   sites (15-25\% of baits) and in unmined forest (15-50\% of baits) tended
   to increase with rehabilitation age as vegetation recovered. The failure
   of some orchid taxa to reinvade rehabilitation areas is unlikely to be
   entirely due to absence of the appropriate mycorrhizal fungi. However,
   since the infrequent detection of fungi suggests that they occur in
   isolated patches of soil, the majority of dispersed orchid seeds are
   likely to perish, especially in recently disturbed habitats.}},

   forest soil were investigated in a reforestation area in eastern
   Finland. The ash and limestone were applied either on the soil surface
   or were mixed into the topsoil using disc ploughing. All the treatments
   were replicated three times. Soil samples were taken from the unploughed
   plots only. Wood ash and liming had reduced acidity in both the organic
   layer and 0-10 cm mineral soil layer for 15 years after application. The
   pH increase in the organic layer was 1.6 and 2.7 pH units on the plots

   Depending on the dose, ash application resulted in a significant 41 to
   47\% increase and liming 34 to 46\% increase in the base saturation of
   the organic layer. Surface broadcast of ash and lime significantly
   increased height growth. On the ash plots the mean height after 15 years
   was 24-27\% and on the limed plots 14-23\% greater than on the control
   plots. There were also signs of an increase in breast height diameter
   caused by ash application and liming. Liming or ash application after

   The highest wood ash dose (5.0 t ha(-1)) changed the chemistry of forest
   litter: the increased pH and total concentrations of most of the
   macronutrients were found after 2 years. In contrast, total N
   concentrations decreased due to ash application. Wood ash increased the
   number of ammonifying, denitrifying microorganisms and
   cellulose-decomposers in the forest litter 3 months after application.
   Wood ash slightly reduced total length of fine roots and number of root
   tips I year after treatment. The highest degree of fine roots vitality
   was found in the plots treated with 2.5-5.0 t ha(-1) of wood ash.
   No changes in ground vegetation diversity were found after the wood ash
   and N application.
   No changes of chlorophyll a, b were determined in the current year

Abstract = {{Fertilizer-induced reductions in CO2 flux from soil (F-co2) in forests

   respiration in the rhizosphere may also contribute to F-co2 reductions

   Fertilization reduced F-co2 by 16-19\% in 65-yr-old plantations of
   northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and
   in a natural 85-yr-old yellow birch (Betula allegheniensis) stand.
   In oak plots, fertilization had no effects on fine root biomass but
   reduced mycorrhizal colonization by 18\% and microbial respiration by
   43\%. In maple plots, fertilization reduced root biomass, mycorrhizal
   colonization and microbial respiration by 22, 16 and 46\%, respectively.
   In birch plots, fertilization reduced microbial respiration by 36\%, but
   had variable effects on root biomass and mycorrhizal colonization.
   In plots of all three species, fertilization effects on microbial
   respiration were greater in rhizosphere than in bulk soil, possibly as a
   result of decreased rhizosphere carbon flux from these species in

   Saprotrophic fungi were primarily confined to relatively recently (< 4

Abstract = {{Rhododendron maximum L., a spreading understory shrub inhibits
   overstory, regeneration and alters forest community structure in
   southern Appalachian hardwood forests. Using paired plots and reciprocal
   litter transplants in forests with and without R. maximum cover, we
   examined the influence of R. maximum on litter mass and quality, N
   cycling and soil extracellular enzymes. Standing stocks of soil organic
   matter, soil N, leaf titter mass and fine root biomass were greater in
   forests with R. maximum than those without. Tannin extracts from R.
   maximum foliage, and leaf litter and fine roots collected under R.
   maximum had a relatively high capacity to precipitate protein compared
   to extracts from trees. Across the growing season, soil inorganic N
   availabitity was generally lower under R. maximum, mostly due to reduced
   NO3- availability. Our data suggest that R. maximum litter alters N
   cycling through the formation of recalcitrant polyphenol-organic N
   complexes. Soil extracellular enzymes indicate the potential. processing
   rates of organic substrates. Between forest types, polyphenol oxidase
   activity was greatest in R. maximum 0 horizons, regardless of Litter
   type, suggesting that the Local. microbial community can better degrade
   and access protein-tannin-complexed N. Protease activity did not differ
   between forest types, but was greater on R. maximum leaf litter than
   hardwood leaf litter. The alteration of the N cycle via the formation of
   polyphenol-organic N complexes may contribute to hardwood seedling
   suppression, while the enzymatic release of these complexes by ericoid
   mycorrhizal fungi may increase N acquisition for R. maximum and
   contribute to its expansion in southern Appalachian forests. (c) 2006

   longipes (Preus) Cooke, Ceuthospora pinastri (Fr.) Hohn., Mollisia
   minutella (Sacc.) Rehm, Scleroconidioma sphagnicola Tsuneda, Currah \&
   Thormann and an unknown strain NK 11 were used as representatives of
   autochthonous mycoflora. Systems were incubated for 5.5 months in
   laboratory conditions. Fungal colonization in systems and competition
   among strains were assessed using the reisolation of fungi from
   individual needles. After incubation, needles were extracted with NaOH
   and extracts were analysed using P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (NMR). Needle decomposition was determined based on the
   decrease in C:N ratio. Systems inoculated with the basidiomycete S.
   androsaceus revealed substantial decrease in C:N ratio (from 25.8 to
   11.3) while the effect of ascomycetes on the C:N ratio was negligible.
   We suppose that tested strains of saprotrophic ascomycetes did not
   participate substantially in litter decomposition, but were directly
   involved in phosphorus transformation and together with S. androsaceus
   could transform orthophosphate monoesters and diesters from spruce
   litter needles into diphosphates, polyphosphates and phosphonates. These
   transformations seem to be typical for saprotrophic fungi involved in
   litter needle decomposition, although the proportion of individual
   phosphorus forms differed among studied fungal strains. Phosphonate
   presence in needles after fungal inoculation is of special interest
   because no previous investigation recorded phosphonate synthesis and
   accumulation by fungi. Our results confirmed that the 31P NMR
   spectroscopy is an excellent instrumental method for studying
   transformations of soil organic phosphorus during plant litter
   decomposition. We suggest that polyphosphate production by S.
   androsaceus may contribute to the phosphorus cycle in forest ecosystems
   because this fungus is a frequent litter colonizer that substantially
   participates in decomposition. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A major uncertainty in predicting long-term ecosystem C balance is
   whether stimulation of net primary production will be sustained in
   future atmospheric CO2 scenarios. Immobilization of nutrients (N in
   particular) in plant biomass and soil organic matter (SOM) provides
   negative feedbacks to plant growth and may lead to progressive N
   limitation (PNL) of plant response to CO2 enrichment. Soil microbes
   mediate N availability to plants by controlling litter decomposition and
   N transformations as well as dominating biological N fixation.
   CO2-induced changes in C inputs, plant nutrient demand and water use
   efficiency often have interactive and contrasting effects on microbes
   and microbially mediated N processes. One critical question is whether
   CO2-induced N accumulation in plant biomass and SOM will result in N
   limitation of microbes and subsequently cause them to obtain N from
   alternative sources or to alter the ecosystem N balance. We reviewed the
   experimental results that examined elevated CO2 effects on microbial
   parameters, focusing on those published since 2000. These results in
   general show that increased C inputs dominate the CO2 impact on
   microbes, microbial activities and their subsequent controls over
   ecosystem N dynamics, potentially enhancing microbial N acquisition and
   ecosystem N retention. We reason that microbial mediation of N
   availability for plants under future CO2 scenarios will strongly depend
   on the initial ecosystem N status, and the nature and magnitude of
   external N inputs. Consequently, microbial processes that exert critical
   controls over long-term N availability for plants would be
   ecosystem-specific. The challenge remains to quantify CO2-induced
   changes in these processes, and to extrapolate the results from
   short-term studies with step-up CO2 increases to native ecosystems that
   are already experiencing gradual changes in the CO2 concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to the continuously increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2,
   it has become a priority to understand if soil organic matter (SOM) will
   behave as a sink or a source of CO2 under future environmental changes.
   Although many studies have addressed this question, a clear
   understanding is still missing, particularly with respect to long-term
   responses. In this study, we quantified soil C stores and dynamics in
   relationship to soil aggregation and pool composition in a Californian
   chaparral ecosystem exposed for 6 years to a gradient of atmospheric CO2
   concentrations, ranging from pre-industrial levels 250 to 750 mu l l(-1)
   CO2. Fossil fuel-derived CO2 depleted in C-13 was used for the
   fumigation, thus providing a tracer of C input from the vegetation to
   the soil.
   Long-term CO2 exposure invariably affected soil aggregation, with a
   significant decrease in the macroaggregate fraction at highest CO2
   levels relative to the other two size fractions (i.e. microaggregates
   and silt and clay). This soil structural change most likely reduced the
   stability and protection of SOM, and C content generally decreased in
   most fractions over the CO2 treatments, and induced faster turnover of
   recently fixed C at high CO2 levels. The strongest response was found in
   the C content of the microaggregates, which decreased significantly (P <
   0.05) with rising levels of CO2. We conclude that increasing atmospheric
   CO2 concentrations will decrease soil C in chaparral ecosystems, and
   that the microaggregate fraction is the most responsive to increasing
   concentrations of atmospheric CO2. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Stable isotope analysis is a powerful tool in the study of soil organic
   matter formation. It is often observed that more decomposed soil organic
   matter is C-13, and especially N-15-enriched relative to fresh litter
   and recent organic matter. We investigated whether this shift in isotope
   composition relates to the isotope composition of the microbial biomass,
   an important source for soil organic matter. We developed a new approach
   to determine the natural abundance C and N isotope composition of the
   microbial biomass across a broad range of soil types, vegetation, and
   climates. We found consistently that the soil microbial biomass was
   N-15-enriched relative to the total (3.2 parts per thousand) and
   extractable N pools (3.7 parts per thousand), and C-13-enriched relative
   to the extractable C pool (2.5 parts per thousand). The microbial
   biomass was also C-13-enriched relative to total C for soils that
   exhibited a C3-plant signature (1.6 parts per thousand), but
   C-13-depleted for soils with a C4 signature (-1.1 parts per thousand).
   The latter was probably associated with an increase of annual C3 forbs
   in C4 grasslands after an extreme drought. These findings are in
   agreement with the proposed contribution of microbial products to the
   stabilized soil organic matter and may help explain the shift in isotope
   composition during soil organic matter formation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Increased use of anthropogenically fixed N and the release of N in
   combustion products have led to concerns about possible long-term
   impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. Previous studies demonstrating the
   potential of atmospheric N deposition to influence forest soil carbon
   have focused on decomposition processes with much less known about
   potential impacts on mycorrhiza-derived carbon. Glomalin is a unique
   glycoprotein produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi that has been
   implicated in the formation of soil aggregates and potentially a
   significant store of soil carbon. To determine the possible impact of
   experimental N deposition of such stores we examined the operationally
   defined glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) levels over two growing
   seasons in three forest types receiving background N deposition
   (control) or treated with 80 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) as NaNO3. Three sites
   of each of three forest types, sugar maple-basswood (SMBW), sugar
   maple-red oak (SMRO), and black oak-white oak (BOWO), in northern Lower
   Michigan were studied during the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons. GRSP
   were extracted from air-dried soils with citric acid and measured by the
   Bradford method. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences
   related to forest type and sample date in easily extractable Bradford
   reactive (EE-BRSP) and Bradford-reactive soil protein (BRSP), but failed
   to detect significant effects of experimental N amendment. EE-BRSP and
   BRSP varied in a pattern that was consistent with an AM fungal origin; a
   pattern that reflected the mycorrhizal types of the dominant over and
   understory plants of each forest ecosystem. SMBW forests dominated by AM
   plants had the highest levels of protein. BOWO forests with low AM plant
   cover had the lowest protein levels and SMRO forests were intermediate.
   Both Bradford-reactive fractions and their ratio varied seasonally,
   generally being highest in fall samples. Significant correlations
   observed between BRSP fractions, phosphorous, and soil organic matter
   were likely related to covariation of soil properties across forest
   types. While not statistically significant, response patterns of BRSP to
   N deposition were ecosystem-specific and reflected mycorrhizal types of
   dominant species. Abundance of these proteins reflected previously
   observed changes in SOC in the two forest types examined with abundant
   AM hosts. Specifically, nitrate addition led to BRSP decreases in SMBW
   and increases in SMRO forests. Changes in BRSP accounted for a small
   fraction of the changes in SOC; appearing to increase as a fraction of
   residual SOC consistent with the idea that GRSP are recalcitrant. BRSP
   remained unchanged at BOWO sites despite a significant increase in SOC
   at these sites. Our results point to the potential of proteins as
   contributors to differential, mycorrhizal type-specific responses to
   changes in soil carbon following N amendment.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of high nitrogen (N) depositions on forest ecosystems is an
   important concern in North America and may lead to N saturation of
   forest ecosystems and contribute to soils and surface water
   acidification. In this study, nitrogen dynamics in the FH layers of a
   sugar maple (SM), a balsam fir (1317) and a black spruce (BS) forest was
   characterized using a short term 15 N isotopic pool dilutions approach
   and mid-term FH material incubation both in situ and in the laboratory.
   The short term dilutions approach indicated that the mean residence
   times of NH4+ and NO3- in the FH material of the three sites were low (<
   1d). The amount of inorganic nitrogen (NH4+ + NO3-) recycled annually
   within the exchangeable forest floor reservoir was between one and two
   orders of magnitude larger than the annual atmospheric N deposition
   found at each of the sites. The BS site was clearly distinct than the
   two other forest types in that net N mineralization was negligible, even
   in absence of root uptake, suggesting that soil microorganisms were
   severely N limited. While net nitrification was not observed within the
   FH material of the BF site, NO3- did accumulate in the FH of the SM
   despite a low pH of 3.72 presumably because of heterotrophic
   nitrification or as a result of acid-tolerant autotrophic nitrification.
   The difference in N dynamics between the sites were most probably caused
   by dominant tree species. Transformation rates of inorganic N were
   higher in SM, followed by BF and BS stands. Given that the potential to
   mineralize inorganic N matches with a superimposed N atmospheric
   deposition gradient in Quebec, the sugar maple forest is more likely to
   be affected by N saturation than coniferous forests. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Belowground communities usually support a much greater diversity of
   organisms than do corresponding aboveground ones, and while the factors
   that regulate their diversity are far less well understood, a growing
   number of recent studies have presented data relevant to understanding
   how these factors operate. This review considers how biotic factors
   influence community diversity within major groups of soil organisms
   across a broad spectrum of spatial scales, and addresses the mechanisms
   involved. At the most local scale, soil biodiversity may potentially be
   affected by interactions within trophic levels or by direct trophic
   interactions. Within the soil, larger bodied invertebrates can also
   influence diversity of smaller sized organisms by promoting dispersal
   and through modification of the soil habitat. At larger scales,
   individual plant species effects, vegetation composition, plant species
   diversity, mixing of plant litter types, and aboveground trophic
   interactions, all impact on soil biodiversity. Further, at the landscape
   scale, soil diversity also responds to vegetation change and succession.
   This review also considers how a conceptual understanding of the biotic
   drivers of soil biodiversity may assist our knowledge of key topics in
   community and ecosystem ecology, such as aboveground-belowground
   interactions, and the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning. It is concluded that an improved understanding of what
   drives the diversity of life in the soil, incorporated within
   appropriate conceptual frameworks, should significantly aid our
   understanding of the structure and functioning of terrestrial

Abstract = {{Allelopathy has been implicated as a factor contributing toward failure
   of black spruce (Picea mariana) regeneration in Kalmia
   angustifolia-dominated sites in eastern Canada. Several phenolic acids
   of Kalmia origin inhibit primary root growth of black spruce. We tested
   the hypothesis that some well-adapted conifer ectomycorrhizae can
   degrade and detoxify water-soluble phenolic compounds produced by Kalmia
   and use the degraded products as a carbon source to stimulate growth. We
   found that hyphal growth of Paxillus involutus, a common ectomycorrhizal
   fungus of black spruce, was stimulated by water leachates of Kalmia leaf
   and litter. An equimolar mixture of three phenolic acids (ferulic,
   o-coumaric, and o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid), commonly found in Kalmia,
   had no negative effects on fungal growth at 1 mM concentration. The
   o-hydroxyphenylacetic (o-HPA) acid, which is known to be toxic to black
   spruce, was found to stimulate the growth of Laccaria laccata, L.
   bicolor, and P. involutus (isolates 211804 and 196554) by 38.4, 29.3,
   25.0, and 18.9\%, respectively, at 1 mM. Pure ferulic, o-coumaric, and
   o-HPA acids were degraded by 100, 98, and 79.5\%, respectively, within
   10 d in the presence of P. involutus 211804. However, L. laccata could
   not tolerate high concentrations of the Kalmia leachates. P. involutus
   and L. bicolor used o-HPA acid as a carbon source when cultured in
   noncarbon nutrient medium. The 0.5 and 0.2 mM o-HPA acid inhibited the
   root growth of black spruce. However, after solutions had been exposed
   to a culture of P. involutus, they had no significant effect on seedling
   growth of black spruce. We concluded that some ectomycorrhizal fungi,
   such as P. involutus and L. bicolor, are able to degrade Kalmia
   phenolics. Our findings point to a mechanism by which ectomycorrhizal
   species can control species interactions in higher plants by changing
   the rhizosphere chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Like other N-fixing invasive species in Hawaii, Falcataria moluccana
   dramatically alters forest structure, litterfall quality and quantity,
   and nutrient dynamics. We hypothesized that these biogeochernical
   changes would also affect the soil microbial community and the
   extracellular enzymes responsible for carbon and nutrient
   mineralization. Across three sites differing in substrate texture and
   age (50-300 years old), we measured soil enzyme activities and microbial
   community parameters in native-dominated and Falcataria-invaded plots.
   Falcataria invasion increased acid phosphatase (AP) activities to > 90
   mu mol g(-1) soil h(-1) compared to 30-60 mu mol g(-1) soil h(-1) in
   nativedominated stands. Extracellular enzymes that mineralize carbon and
   nitrogen also increased significantly under Falcataria on the younger
   substrates. By contrast, total microbial biomass and mycorrhizal
   abundance changed little with invasion or substrate. However, fungal:
   bacterial ratios declined dramatically with invasion, from 2.69 and 1.35
   to < 0.89 on the 50- and 200-year-old substrates, respectively. These
   results suggest that Falcataria invasion alters the composition and
   function of belowground soil communities in addition to forest structure
   and biogeochemistry. The increased activities of AP and other enzymes
   that we observed are consistent with a shift toward phosphorus
   limitation and rapid microbial processing of litterfall C and N

Abstract = {{To examine the effect of the spatial distribution of litter and

   bodies, we surveyed spatial distribution of fruiting bodies of
   Agaricales in a mixed forest dominated by Pinus densiflora (Sieb et
   Zucc.) from July 1999 to July 2002. Three 10 x 10-m plots with different
   vegetation and positions on a slope were established: Top-Mixed,
   Top-Pinus, and Bottom-Pinus. Litter thickness in the Top-Mixed plot was
   the thinnest among the three plots. During the study, we counted 3563
   fruiting bodies in 27 genera from 13 families. The dominant genera were
   Collybia, Marasmius, Mycena, Rhodophyllus, and Lactarius, and showed an
   intrageneric aggregated distribution at a quadrat size of 1m(2).
   Collybia and Lactarius formed fruiting bodies in arcs. The spatial
   distribution of Collybia, Marasmius, and Lactarius fruiting bodies
   tended to overlap in two consecutive years. In the Top-Mixed plot, the
   number of Marasmius fruiting bodies increased with increasing litter
   thickness, while that of Lactarius decreased with litter thickness.
   Values of C' (delta) indicating degree of overlap were calculated for
   particular pairs of dominant fungal genera and the values differed
   between plots and years: for example, fruiting bodies of Marasmius and
   Mycena in the Bottom-Pinus plot were distributed aggregately in 1999 and
   2000, but randomly in 2001, while they were distributed segregatedly in
   the Top-Pinus plot every year. Our study suggests that the spatial
   distribution of fungal fruiting bodies is affected by the distribution
   of litter in and between plots and that fungal flora is affected by
   vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of autumn application of urea on the activity and composition
   of saprotrophic fungi associated with sour cherry (Prunus cerasus) leaf
   litter infected with the leaf spot pathogen, Blumeriella jaapii, was
   studied under orchard conditions from the time of leaf fall to the
   release of ascospores, the following spring. The ability of treatment of
   infected leaves post leaf fall with urea or with inoculum of selected
   fungal strains to reduce primary inoculum (ascospores and winter
   conidia) of B. jaapii in spring was evaluated. Fungal activity was
   measured enzymatically by quantifying beta-N-acetylgly-cosaminidase and
   fungal composition and frequency were evaluated following isolation at
   low temperature of mycelia embedded in leaf particles. Activity of the
   general fungal flora increased in both the urea and water treatments
   throughout the experimental period and a significantly higher level of
   activity was detected in urea-treated leaves up to 79 days after
   treatment. Most of the 2,146 fungal isolates recovered from the leaf
   litter during November-May could be placed in the following six groups:
   Phoma macrostoma (52.7\%), other Phoma spp. (12.3\%), Cladosporium. spp.
   (13.8\%), Alternaria and Ulocladium spp. (5.4\%), Epicoccum.
   purpurascens (2.9\%) and Fusarium. spp. (1.6\%). These groups were
   isolated from the leaf litter throughout the experimental period and the
   effect of urea on fungal composition in the litter was very limited. Of
   these groups only the frequency of recovery of E. purpurascens was
   higher from urea than from water-treated leaves and this significant
   difference was maintained throughout the 115 days of the experimental
   period. Phoma macrostoma var. macrostoma, Cladosporium. sp., Ulocladium
   chatarum, Epicoccum purpurascens and Fusarium lateritium var. lateritium
   were evaluated and compared with urea to reduce primary inoculum of B.
   jaapii. Urea reduced primary inoculum of B. jaapii in the spring by 77\%

   found to be equally effective.}},

Abstract = {{The release of carbon as CO(2) from belowground processes accounts for
   about 70\% of total ecosystem respiration. Insights about factors
   controlling soil CO(2) efflux are constrained by the challenge of
   apportioning sources of CO(2) between autotrophic tree roots (and
   mycorrhizal fungi) and heterotrophic microorganisms. In some temperate
   conifer forests, the reduction in soil CO(2) efflux after girdling
   (phloem removal) has been used to separate these sources. Girdling stops
   the flow of carbohydrates to the belowground portion of the ecosystem,
   which should slow respiration by roots and mycorrhizae while
   heterotrophic respiration should remain constant or be enhanced by the
   decomposition of newly dead roots. Therefore, the reduction in CO(2)
   efflux after girdling should be a conservative estimate of the
   belowground flux of C from trees. We tested this approach in two
   tropical Eucalyptus plantations. Tree canopies remained intact for more
   than 3 months after girdling, showing no reduction in light
   interception. The reduction in soil CO(2) efflux averaged 16-24\% for
   the 3-month period after girdling. The reduction in CO(2) efflux was
   similar for plots with one half of the trees girdled and those with all
   of the trees girdled. Girdling did not reduce live fine root biomass for
   at least 5 months after treatment, indicating that large reserves of
   carbohydrates in the root systems of Eucalyptus trees maintained the
   roots and root respiration. Our results suggest that the girdling
   approach is unlikely to provide useful insights into the contribution of
   tree roots and heterotrophs to soil CO(2) efflux in this type of forest
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the effects of changes in the plant community and
   belowground soil ecosystem in a mountain meadow, from the invasion of
   leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) and Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense
   L.), and the subsequent management efforts to remove them. Sampling
   included three paired sites containing areas where herbicides and
   mechanical means had been employed and which were still dominated by
   leafy spurge, and areas where herbicides had not been applied and where
   very little (< 0.03\%) or no leafy spurge or Canada thistle existed.
   Plant species diversity, frequency, and percent cover were estimated.
   Decomposition rates were assessed by use of litterbags placed on the
   sites and retrieved after I year. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal
   inoculum potential was used as an index for mutualistic associations.
   Soil microarthropod densities were used as an index for the detrital
   food web. Significantly greater (P <= 0.05) richness of plant species
   and significantly higher percent relative cover of herbs, sedges,
   lichen, moss, and fallen litter was found on non-invasive plots compared
   to plots with invasive species. Plots where herbicides had been applied,
   and which still possessed leafy spurge, showed a significantly higher
   percentage of bare ground. Mycorrhizal inoculum potential did not differ
   between plots. Overall soil arthropod densities and densities of
   specific suborders of Acari were significantly lower (P <= 0.05) in
   invasive species plots. There was no significant difference in
   decomposition rates between non-invasive and invasive plots, but there
   were site differences in losses of lignin, phosphorus, and trace
   elements from litter placed on invasive and non-invasive plots. When
   differences were observed, loss rates were always less in invasive
   plots. Our results indicate that the establishment of leafy spurge and
   Canada thistle and the subsequent management practices to control them
   has altered the plant community structure by facilitating the
   establishment of other exotic species, which has resulted in a change in

Abstract = {{Previous research on the effects of tree species on soil processes has
   focused primarily on the role of leaf litter inputs. We quantified the
   extent to which arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM)
   tree species influence soil microbial activity and nutrient availability
   through rhizosphere effects. Rhizosphere soil, bulk soil and fine roots
   were collected front 12 monospecife plots (six AM and six ECM tree
   species) planted on a common soil at the Turkey Hill Plantations in
   Dryden, New York. Rhizosphere effects were estimated by the percentage
   difference between rhizosphere and bulk soil samples for several assays.
   Rhizosphere effects on soil microbes and their activities were
   significant for ECM species but in only a few cases for AM species. In
   AM tree species, microbial biomass, net N mineralization, and
   phosphatase enzyme activity in the rhizosphere were 10-12\% greater than
   in bulk soil. In ECM tree species, rhizosphere effects for microbial
   biomass, C mineralization rates, net N mineralization, and phosphatase
   activity were 25-30\% greater than bulk soil, and significantly greater
   than AM rhizosphere effects. The magnitude of rhizosphere effects was
   negatively correlated with the degree of mycorrhizal colonization in AM
   tree species (r = -0.83) and with fine root biomass (r = -0.88) in ECM
   tree species, suggesting that different factors influence rhizosphere
   effects in tree species forming different mycorrhizal associations.
   Rhizosphere effects on net N mineralization and phosphatase activity
   were also much greater in soils with pH < 4.3 for both AM and ECM tree
   species, suggesting that. soil pH and its relation to nutrient
   availability may also influence the magnitude of rhizosphere effects.
   Our results support the idea that tree roots stimulate nutrient
   availability in the rhizosphere, and that systematic differences between
   AM and ECM may result in distinctive rhizosphere effects for C, N, and P
   cycling between AM and ECM tree species.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in nutrient inputs due to aboveground herbivory may influence
   the litter and soil microbial community responsible for processes such
   as decomposition. The mesophyll-feeding scale insect (Matsucoccus
   acalyptus) found near Sunset Crater National Monument in northern
   Arizona, USA significantly increases pinon (Pinus edulis) needle litter
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations by 50\%, as well as
   litter inputs to soil by 21\%. Because increases in needle litter
   quality and quantity of this magnitude should affect the microbial
   communities responsible for decomposition, we tested the hypothesis that
   insect herbivory causes a shift in soil microbial and litter
   microarthropod function. Four major findings result from this research:
   (1) Despite increases in needle inputs due to herbivory, soil carbon (C)
   was 56\% lower beneath scale-susceptible trees than beneath resistant
   trees; however, soil moisture, N, and pH were similar among treatments.
   (2) Microbial biomass was 80\% lower in soils beneath scale-susceptible
   trees when compared to resistant trees in the dry season, while
   microbial enzyme activities were lower beneath susceptible trees in the
   wet season. (3) Bacterial community-level physiological profiles
   differed significantly between susceptible and resistant trees during
   the dry season but not during the wet season. (4) There was a 40\%
   increase in Oribatida and 23\% increase in Prostigmata in susceptible
   needle litter relative to resistant litter. Despite these changes, the
   magnitude of microbial biomass, activity, and community structure
   response to herbivory was lower than expected and appears to take a long
   time to develop. These results suggest that herbivores impact soils in
   subtle, but important ways; we suggest that while litter chemistry may
   strongly mediate soil fertility and microbial communities in mesic
   ecosystems, the influence is lower than expected in this primary
   succession xeric ecosystem where season mediates differences in
   microbial populations. Understanding how insect herbivores alter the
   distribution of susceptible and resistant trees and their associated
   decomposer communities in and environments may lead to better prediction
   of how these ecosystems respond to climatic change. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The composition of forest litter and understorey layer, and fungal
   biomass (in terms of ergosterol) were measured in eight subplots over a
   winter-spring period (January to April). The sampling site was
   positioned in a range of woodland habitats (variously dominated by
   beech, Fagus sylvatica; birch, Betula pendula x pubescens, and oak
   Quercus petraea) and a clear area covered with grass (dominated by
   Holcus lanatus). The results were analysed together with data on
   bacteria and microinvertebrates available from parallel research. Levels
   of ergosterol in individual subplots ranged between 50 and 160 mu g
   g(-1) DW. Fungal biomass decreased in March, and then increased
   significantly in April. Stepwise regression models for ergosterol
   indicated positive relationships with moisture content (February),
   bacteria (all but February and March), flagellates (February) and
   plant-feeding nematodes and flies (January, overall). The relationships
   with roots, seeds, the collective variable `other microinvertebrates'
   (all March), amoebae (February) and fragments (March, overall) were
   negative, while the relationship between fungi- and microbial-feeding
   nematodes changed sign between February (-) and March (+). Results of
   analysis of covariance for fungal ergosterol were significant only for
   January and the combined dataset. In January, fungi were shown to be
   significantly related to amoebae, bacteria and a collembolan Folsomia
   candida, while the only significant predictor returned by the overall
   model was bacteria. Correlation analysis confirmed some effects already
   noted, and revealed a number of further interactions. The results
   highlighted the complexity of factors influencing temporal dynamics and
   spatial variability of fungal biomass in forest litter. Most of the
   registered interactions appeared to be transient, and this should be
   taken into account while interpreting environmental observations.
   Interpretation of the specific relationships is given and implications
   for further research and overall ecosystem functioning are discussed.}},

   Scleroconidioma sphagnicola was simulated with strains of the
   autochthonous litter colonizers Ceuthospora pinastri (Fr.) Hohn.,
   Chalara longipes (Preus) Cooke, Setulipes androsaceus (L.) Antonin
   (Marasmius androsaceus (L.) Fr.), and Mollisia minutella (Sacc.) Rehm
   and the wood-decaying fungus Hypholoma fasciculare (Huds.) Quel.
   Pairings were performed on agar plates with two types of low-nutrient
   medium made from spruce litter needles. Reisolation on nutritionally
   rich agar medium following the competition revealed that Sleroconidioma
   sphagnicola was mostly successfully reisolated even though apparently
   being replaced by the mycelium of other fungi. It formed strongly
   melanised mycelium and microsclerotia that seem to be responsible for
   its resistance to fungal competition. All tested strains of needle
   litter colonizers were outcompeted by Hypholomaafasciculare. Enzymatic
   screening aimed at semiquantitative assay of polyphenol oxidase,
   peroxidase, and tyrosinace revealed that Scleroconidioma sphagnicola,
   together with other strains, was able to produce polyphenol oxidase and
   peroxidase on various nutritional media. Activity of tyrosinase was
   detected only for Hypholomaafasciculare. Previous records of
   Scleroconidioma sphagnicola from moss, wood, and our isolations from
   spruce litter suggest that this species possesses an ability to occupy a
   wide spectrum of niches.}},

Abstract = {{Established vegetation can facilitate the ectomycorrhizal infection of

   the phylogenetic relatedness of trees and seedlings. We use a series of
   bioassay experiments to test whether soil modification by different
   ectomycorrhizal tree species causes different levels of seedling
   infection, whether the extent of seedling infection is a function of the
   relatedness of tree and seedling, and whether the effect of trees on
   seedlings is mediated by biotic or abiotic soil factors. We found that
   soils from under different tree species do vary in their mycorrhizal
   infectiveness. However, this variation is not related to the genetic
   relatedness of trees and seedlings but instead, appears to be an
   attribute of the overstory species, irrespective of seedling species,
   mediated through a suite of humus- and base-cation-related abiotic
   effects on soils. Modification of abiotic soil properties by overstory
   trees should be considered as an important factor in the effect of

Abstract = {{The atmospheric concentration of CO2 is predicted to reach double

   parts constitutes the primary source of C for soil organic matter (SOM),

   to mitigate increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In a poplar
   (three species) plantation exposed to ambient (380 ppm) and elevated
   (580 ppm) atmospheric CO2 concentrations using a Free Air Carbon Dioxide
   Enrichment (FACE) system, the relative importance of leaf litter
   decomposition, fine root and fungal turnover for C incorporation into
   SOM was investigated. A technique using cores of soil in which a C-4
   crop has been grown (delta C-13 -18.1 parts per thousand) inserted into
   the plantation and detritus from C-3 trees (delta C-13 -27 to -30 parts

   (tree derived) soil C. In-growth cores using a fine mesh (39 mu m) to
   prevent in-growth of roots, but allow in-growth of fungal hyphae were
   used to assess contribution of fine roots and the mycorrhizal external

   Across all species and treatments, the mycorrhizal external mycelium was
   the dominant pathway (62\%) through which carbon entered the SOM pool,
   exceeding the input via leaf litter and fine root turnover. The input
   via the mycorrhizal external mycelium was not influenced by elevated
   CO2, but elevated atmospheric CO2 enhanced soil C inputs via fine root
   turnover. The turnover of the mycorrhizal external mycelium may be a
   fundamental mechanism for the transfer of root-derived C to SOM.}},

Title = {{Using experimental manipulation to assess the roles of leaf litter in
   the functioning of forest ecosystems}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-31}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The widespread use of forest litter as annual bedding in central Europe
   for many, centuries gave rise to the first litter manipulation studies,
   and their results demonstrated that litter and its decomposition are a
   vital part or ecosystem function. Litter plays two major roles in forest
   ecosystems: firstly, litterfall is all inherent part of nutrient and
   carbon cycling, and secondly, litter forms a protective layer oil the
   soil surface that also regulates microclimatic conditions. By reviewing
   152 years of litter manipulation experiments, I show that the effects or
   manipulating litter stem from changes in one, or both, of these two
   functions, and interactions between the variables influenced by the
   accumulation of litter can result in feedback mechanisms that may
   intensify treatment effects or mask responses, making the interpretation
   of results difficult.
   Long-term litter removal increased soil bulk density, overland flow,
   erosion, and temperature fluctuations and upset the soil water balance,
   causing lower soil water content during dry periods. Soil pH increased
   or decreased in response to manipulation treatments depending on forest
   type and initial soil pH, but unclear why there was no uniform response.
   Long-term litter harvesting severely depleted the forests of nutrients.
   Decreases in the concentrations of available P, Ca, Mg, and K in the
   soil occurred after only three to five years. The decline in soil N
   occurred over longer periods of time, and the relative loss was greater
   in soils with high initial nitrogen concentration. Tree growth declined
   with long-term litter removal, probably due to lower nutrient
   availability. Litter manipulation also added or removed large amounts of
   carbon thereby affecting microbial communities and altering soil
   respiration rates.
   Litter manipulation experiments have shown that litter cover acts as a
   physical barrier to the shoot emergence of small-seeded species;
   further, the microclimate maintained by the litter layer may be
   Favourable to herbivores and pathogens and is important in determining
   later seedling survival and performance. Litter manipulation altered the
   competitive outcomes between tree seedlings and forbs, thereby
   influencing species composition and diversity; changes in the species
   composition of understorey vegetation following treatments occurred
   rapidly. By decreasing substrate availability and altering the
   microclimate, litter removal changed fungal species composition and
   diversity and led to a decline in populations of soil fauna. However,
   litter addition did not provoke an corresponding increase in the
   abundance or diversity of fungi or soil fauna.
   Large-scale long-term studies are still needed in order to investigate
   the interactions between the many variables affected by litter,
   especially in tropical and boreal forests, which have received little
   attention. Litter manipulation treatments present an opportunity to
   assess the effects of increasing primary production in forest
   ecosystems; specific research aims include assessing the effect of
   changes in litter inputs on the carbon and nutrient cycles,
   decomposition processes, and the turnover of organic matter.}},

   Leaf litter mass loss in the D. corymbosa forest was not influenced by

   of EM, which were negatively correlated with EM rootlet-colonizing mass.
   The lack of EM effect on the litter decomposition rate, coupled with

   extractable phosphorus (13.3 cf. 0 - 0.08 mu g g(-1)) and total phenol
   content and lowest condensed tannin content. These differences were
   imparted to rooting matrix of homogenized humic (Oa) layer of pine
   barrens soil to which milled leaf litter was added and used in the
   microcosms. Pitch pine seedlings grew significantly better in un-amended
   rooting matrix (0.33 +/- 0.02 g) than any of the litter treatments (0.15
   +/- 0.02 - 0.17 +/- 0.01 g) and tissue P concentrations tracked
   phosphate concentrations in the rooting matrix. Total P accumulation
   into plant tissue was higher in oak than control, attributable to a
   significantly higher (P < 0.05) accumulation in roots (3.3 +/- 0.19 mg
   g(-1)) compared to other species (1.1 +/- 0.04 - 2.3 +/- 0.08 mg g(-1)).
   No relationship was seen between tissue N concentration and soil N, but
   seedlings growing in huckleberry litter amended soil accumulated less N
   than control. The effect of leaf litters on the ectomycorrhizal
   community composition were determined by PCA (first two axes accounted
   for 81\% of the variance) and stepwise multiple regression analysis.
   These analyses showed that huckleberry leaf litter had a significant
   impact on mycorrhizal community composition with morphotypes Cg and DB
   being more abundant in the presence of huckleberry litter (178 +/- 13
   cf. 68 +/- 15 - 106 +/- 15 for Cg and 141 +/- 11 cf. 88 +/- 23 - 111 +/-
   18 for DB) and its influence of elevating nitrate nitrogen, organic
   nitrogen, total phenols and protein precipitation content of the rooting
   matrix. Mycorrhizal morphotypes BS and SB were significantly more
   abundant in the community where these soil factors were low in the
   absence of leaf litter addition. Total ectomycorrhizal abundance was
   negatively related to hydrolysable tannin concentration in the rooting
   matrix (r(2) = 0.132, P < 0.05). There was no influence of leaf litter
   type on mite density (dominated by nonburrowing phthiracarids), but
   collembolan density (dominated by Folsomia spp) showed a greater than
   threefold reduction in population density in the presence of leaf litter
   (F = 6.47, P < 0.05). Collembolan density was positively correlated with
   mycorrhizal morphotypes GS and SB (P < 0.05) and negatively related to
   morphotypes DB (P < 0.05) and soil extractable NH4-N (P < 0.05),
   suggesting a possible selection of fungal species in their diet and a
   relationship between collembola and nitrification. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Title = {{Fine root chemistry and decomposition in model communities of
   north-temperate tree species show little response to elevated
   atmospheric CO2 and varying soil resource availability}},

Abstract = {{Rising atmospheric {[}CO2] has the potential to alter soil carbon (C)
   cycling by increasing the content of recalcitrant constituents in plant
   litter, thereby decreasing rates of decomposition. Because fine root
   turnover constitutes a large fraction of annual NPP, changes in fine
   root decomposition are especially important. These responses will likely
   be affected by soil resource availability and the life history
   characteristics of the dominant tree species. We evaluated the effects
   of elevated atmospheric {[}CO2] and soil resource availability on the
   production and chemistry, mycorrhizal colonization, and decomposition of
   fine roots in an early- and late-successional tree species that are
   economically and ecologically important in north temperate forests.
   Open-top chambers were used to expose young trembling aspen (Populus
   tremuloides) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) trees to ambient (36 Pa)
   and elevated (56 Pa) atmospheric CO2. Soil resource availability was
   composed of two treatments that bracketed the range found in the Upper
   Lake States, USA. After 2.5 years of growth, sugar maple had greater
   fine root standing crop due to relatively greater allocation to fine
   roots (30\% of total root biomass) relative to aspen (7\% total root
   biomass). Relative to the low soil resources treatment, aspen fine root
   biomass increased 76\% with increased soil resource availability, but
   only under elevated {[}CO2]. Sugar maple fine root biomass increased
   26\% with increased soil resource availability (relative to the low soil
   resources treatment), and showed little response to elevated
   {[}CO2]Concentrations of N and soluble phenolics, and C/N ratio in roots
   were similar for the two species, but aspen had slightly higher lignin
   and lower condensed tannins contents compared to sugar maple. As
   predicted by source-sink models of carbon allocation, pooled
   constituents (C/N ratio, soluble phenolics) increased in response to
   increased relative carbon availability (elevated {[}CO2]/low soil
   resource availability), however, biosynthetically distinct compounds
   (lignin, starch, condensed tannins) did not always respond as predicted.
   We found that mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots was not strongly
   affected by atmospheric {[}CO2] or soil resource availability, as
   indicated by root ergosterol contents. Overall, absolute changes in root
   chemical composition in response to increases in C and soil resource
   availability were small and had no effect on soil fungal biomass or
   specific rates of fine root decomposition. We conclude that root
   contributions to soil carbon cycling will mainly be influenced by fine
   root production and turnover responses to rising atmospheric {[}CO2],
   rather than changes in substrate chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Decomposition of plant litter by the soil microbial community is an
   important process of controlling nutrient cycling and soil humus
   formation. Fungal laccases are key players in litter-associated
   polyphenol degradation, but little is known about the diversity and
   spatial distribution of fungal species with laccase genes in soils.
   Diversity of basidiomycete laccase genes was assessed in a cambisolic
   forest soil, and the spatial distribution of the sequences was mapped in
   a 100-m(2) plot by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on soil DNA
   extracts. Diversity of laccase sequences was higher in the organic
   horizon and decreased with the depth. A total of 167 different sequences
   sharing 44-96\% oligonucleotide similarity was found in 13 soil cores
   harvested in the 100-m(2) plot. Dissimilarity in laccase sequence
   content was 67\% between adjacent cores; 45.5\%, 35.5\% and 19\% of
   laccase sequences were attributed to ectomycorrhizal, unknown and
   saprotrophic basidiomycetes, respectively. Most dominant sequences were
   attributed to the extramatrical hyphae of known ectomycorrhizal taxa
   (e.g., Russulaceae) and restricted to small patches (< 0.77 m(2)) in a
   specific soil horizon. Soil fungi with laccase genes occupied different
   niches and showed strikingly variable distribution patterns. The
   distribution of laccase sequences, and corresponding fungi, likely
   reflected a part of the oxidative potential in soils.}},

Abstract = {{Fungi are an important and diverse component of soil communities, but
   these communities have proven difficult to study in conventional biotic
   surveys. We evaluated soil fungal diversity at two sites in a temperate
   forest using direct isolation of small-subunit and internal transcribed
   spacer (ITS) rRNA genes by PCR and high-throughput sequencing of cloned
   fragments. We identified 412 sequence types from 863 fungal ITS
   sequences, as well as 112 ITS sequences from other eukaryotic
   microorganisms. Equal proportions of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota
   sequences were present in both the ITS and small-subunit libraries,
   while members of other fungal phyla were recovered at much lower
   frequencies. Many sequences closely matched sequences from mycorrhizal,
   plant-pathogenic, and saprophytic fungi. Compositional differences were
   observed among samples from different soil depths, with mycorrhizal
   species predominating deeper in the soil profile and saprophytic species
   predominating in the litter layer. Richness was consistently lowest in
   the deepest soil horizon samples. Comparable levels of fungal richness
   have been observed following traditional specimen-based collecting and
   culturing surveys, but only after much more extensive sampling. The high
   rate at which new sequence types were recovered even after sampling 863
   fungal ITS sequences and the dominance of fungi in our libraries
   relative to other eukaryotes suggest that the abundance and diversity of
   fungi in forest soils may be much higher than previously hypothesized.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular methods were used to test the hypothesis that severe infection
   by dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium, a carbon-sink parasite) affects the
   ectomycorrhizal (EM) communities of its host, lodgepole pine. Results
   indicate significantly lower EM fungal species richness (2 +/- 0.2 SE
   species per core in uninfected and 1 +/- 0.2 species per core in
   infected blocks; P < 0.005), Shannon-Wiener diversity indices (1.1 in
   uninfected and 0.6 in infected; P < 0.05), and also differences in
   species EM fungal composition; uninfected blocks are dominated by a
   species of Cortinarius while the infected stand is dominated by species
   of Russula, and Piloderma (26\%). By contrast, dwarf mistletoe infection
   has no apparent effect on evenness (0.65 in controls and 0.47 in
   infected; 0.05 < P < 0.1), or on EM infection levels (35 +/- 7 EM tips
   per core in uninfected and 21 +/- 5 in infected; P > 0.1). Thus, dwarf
   mistletoe infection may select for EM fungal species that impose a lower
   carbon demand on the host, or that possess carbon-degrading abilities to
   augment carbon lost to the parasite, enabling the trees in infected
   blocks to maintain relatively high EM infection levels. Our results
   indicate that effects of dwarf mistletoe infection occur not just in the
   crown of infected but extend into the soil as well, and hence may have
   much greater implications for ecosystem function than previously
   thought.}},
