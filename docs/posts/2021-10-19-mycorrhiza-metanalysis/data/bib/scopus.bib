abstract = {Recent changes in the species diversity and sporocarp production of ectomycorrhizal fungi in different regions of, and forest communities within, Europe are discussed with special emphasis on events in The Netherlands. In some forests in some regions fewer ectomycorrhizal fungi are now producing sporocarps, notably those associated with trees more than 40 years old and in particular conifers, for instance species of Phellodon, Hydnellum, Suillus, Tricholoma and Cortinarius. It is argued that this decline in different parts of Europe is coincident with decreased numbers of mycorrhizas. A scheme of progressive changes with three phases of ectomycorrhizal impoverishment and seven subphases is presented. The more probable causes of decline are discussed, namely forest succession, the collection of sporocarps (of edible mycorrhizal fungi), changes in forest management, direct influences of air pollutants, acidification of forest soils and consequent increased availability of aluminium in soil solution, nitrogen deposition, increased litter accumulation, changes in the herb layer of forests and reduced tree vitality. It is argued that changes in the populations of ectomycorrhizal fungi are most likely to be attributable to indirect effects of air pollution, in particular to increases in amounts of available nitrogen (possibly in combination with acidification) and/or to decreased tree vitality wity consequent reductions in the transport of current assimilates to roots and mycorrhizas. The relative importance of these different factors, and their interactions, are likely to differ in different locations. It is supposed that liming and applications of other corrective fertilizers are unlikely to restore the diversity and sporocarp production of ectomycorrhizal fungi; they may even have adverse effects. In the circumstances therefore it seems that the abatement of emissions is likely to be the only effective way of improving and sustaining stable forest ecosystems in areas at risk, notably in densely populated Europe. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Livestock production in Latin America has replaced tropical dry forests with conventional monocultures pastures (CP) that have degraded soils. As an alternative to CP, intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS) have been developed with multi-canopied vegetation that mimics native forest (F). The litter inputs and year-round presence of the tree rhizosphere in ISS, contribute to the formation of " fertile islands," which is expected to impact biological activity and crop productivity. This study, investigated the impact of the conversion of CP to ISS, as well as the effect of canopy of Prosopis juliflora trees in a chronosequence of ISS (3-15years) on soil microbial communities and the physicochemical properties of soil. FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) profiles indicated that soil microbial community structure and composition shifted depending on land management systems. CP promoted the dominance of G - bacteria, while ISS chronosequence and F favored actinomycetes and fungal biomass (total and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). In addition, soil microbial community (FAME profiles) of ISS chronosequence and F were more similar than with CP. An increase in the Cy/pre FAME ratio in CP suggested that the microbial community was under higher stress. The advantage of including trees in pasture systems was reinforced by the observation that FAME biomarkers, enzymatic activities and nutrient status were significantly higher beneath the canopy of P. juliflora. The results indicate that ISS are viable alternatives for improving soil quality and metabolic function, which is reflected in the significant increase in microbial biomass, FAME biomarkers and enzyme activities compared with CP. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Symbiotic di-nitrogen (N2) fixation is a critical biogeochemical process in tropical forests, yet it remains unresolved how fixation is controlled by the availability of soil nitrogen and phosphorus, two nutrients often considered limiting in terrestrial ecosystems. We examine whether individual N2-fixing trees can overcome nitrogen and phosphorus constraints by employing different strategies of nutrient acquisition and use: N2 fixation, phosphatase exudation, mycorrhizal symbiosis and changes in root-shoot ratio or tissue stoichiometry. We grew a common and widespread N2 fixer, Inga punctata, in a full factorial nitrogen and phosphorus addition experiment (each nutrient at three levels) and evaluated whether trees adjusted their strategies of nutrient acquisition to overcome limitation. N2 fixation was controlled by nitrogen availability in phosphorus-sufficient soils, but both fixation and plant growth were constrained by phosphorus in the unamended native phosphorus-poor soils. Despite the investment in both extracellular phosphatases and mycorrhizal symbionts, plants were unable to overcome phosphorus limitation. Our findings support the hypotheses that: (i) N2 fixation is proximately controlled by nitrogen availability, consistent with a facultative fixation strategy, and (ii) N2 fixation and N2 fixer biomass growth are ultimately constrained by soil phosphorus. We found no support for the hypothesis that fixers can overcome phosphorus limitation by trading fixed N2 for soil phosphorus. Synthesis. This study provides new knowledge about how nitrogen and phosphorus interact to regulate tropical N2 fixation by examining a suite of strategies that plants may employ to overcome nutrient limitation. These findings, focused at the organismal level, have broader implications for biogeochemical controls at the ecosystem level in tropical forests.

abstract = {Soil microorganisms can make up more than 95% of the total soil biomass, and plays important role in decomposition of carbon sources and organic matter. Forest management practices (e.g., harvesting, burning, and thinning) influence the composition of the soil microbial community by affecting habitat and substrate for soil microorganisms directly and indirectly, and hence affect soil carbon process. Quantifying the responses of the soil microbial community to forest management is vital to accurately evaluate forest carbon balance and to reveal the underlying mechanisms of soil carbon process change. Thus, an aerially seeded Pinus massoniana forest was chosen in the Three Gorges reservoir area to evaluate the effects on soil microbial community owing to different forest management practices (i.e., control; shrub-removal: harvesting all shrubs and removing all harvest residues. Harvest strategy 1: 15% harvest intensity and removing main harvest residues without leaves and small branches; Harvest strategy 2: 70% harvest intensity and the same harvest residue management as that in harvest 1). All experimental treatments were located in similar habitats and consisted of three 20 m × 20 m plots. The treatments were conducted in October 2013, and soil samples were collected in December 2013 (2 months post treatments) and December 2014 (12 months post treatments) to analyze soil microbial community by using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) methods, and analyze soil chemical properties. The results showed that the total microbial biomass and biomass of all microbial species (except arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) in shrub-removal, harvest strategy 1 and harvest strategy 2 were lower than those of the control in December 2014. However, there was no consistent rule observed in December 2013. Principal component analysis indicated that all treatments showed no significant change in soil microbial community structure in December 2013; the 2 principal component factors related to microbial community diversity explained 60.90% and 17.40% of the variation respectively. Shrub-removal, harvest strategy 1 and harvest strategy 2 did significantly affect soil microbial community structure in December 2014, and the 2 principal component factors related to microbial community diversity explained 50.40% and 26.70% of the variation respectively. In 2013, 5 PLFAs (Mel 16:0, 16: 1w5c, 16: 1w7c, al17:0 and 20: 1w9c) played a major role in the first principal component, and 7 PLFAs (Mel16:0, 16:1w5c, 14:0, 16:0, cy17:0, 16:1w7c, i14:0) played a major role in the first principal component in 2014. The fungi (20: 1w9c) PLFAs played the most significant role in the first principal component in 2013 and was replaced by gram negative bacteria (16:1w7c) PLFAs in 2014. Soil moisture, ratio of soil temperature and soil moisture, and soil microbial quotient (ratio of soil microbial biomass carbon and soil organic carbon) were significant factors regulating soil microbial community structure at different treatment times (P < 0.05), as revealed by redundancy analysis (RDA). {\textcopyright} 2018 Science Press.

abstract = {Biochar is gaining increasing attention in the fields of forest rehabilitation, agriculture, etc. For evaluating biochar application to improve the rhizosphere environment of Japanese black pine (Pinus thunbergii) at harsh coastal environments, a pot experiment was carried out with a focus on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis and water relations of seedlings. Another characteristic recently observed at coastal forests is the invasion of the locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), which can potentially increase soil nitrogen. In this study, four treatments were examined (biochar addition, litter addition, biochar and litter addition, and no addition [control]) to determine the effects of biochar and/or nitrogen-rich locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) litter application. Although effects of biochar and litter addition were not observed on ECM symbiosis rate and species composition, treatments with biochar addition, maintained xylem water potential (XWP) of needles for up to 2 weeks without irrigation, independent of litter addition. As biochar increased relative fine root biomass (fine root biomass/total root biomass), it can be considered that biochar was able to maintain needle XWP through increasing the relative amount of fine roots that can obtain water. Overall, these findings suggest that biochar application can help to maintain water relations of Japanese black pine by enhancing fine root growth. {\textcopyright} 2020, {\textcopyright} 2020 The Japanese Forest Society.},

The fungi of the two life forms are known to be capable of utilizing different types of N sources (organic N compounds from the humus, inorganic N from the soil and N from litter or wood) differing by their 15N natural abundance values. Based on the two life forms and the three different N sources, four functional groups of fungi were distinguished: (1) ectomycorrhizal fungi capable of utilizing organic N from the humus; (2) ectomycorrhizal fungi known to depend on inorganic N compounds in the soil; (3) saprophytes capable of utilizing organic N from the humus; and (4) saprophytes utilizing N from dead wood or litter. Large differences were found between species in the $\delta$15N values (-3.0 to 3.3‰) and in the N concentrations (0.84 to 6.61 mmol eq N g dw-1) of the fruit bodies. In most cases fungi were more enriched in 15N than their respective bulk N source was. Fungi living in humus, and presumably having access to organic N compounds (groups 1 and 3), were significantly more enriched in 15N than fungi which are known to depend on inorganic N (e.g. Laccaria, group 2), or fungi living on litter or wood (group 4), irrespective of whether they were ectomycorrhizal or saprophytic species.

abstract = {Background and objectives: aggregation and structure play key roles in the water-holding capacity and stability of soils and are important for the physical protection and storage of soil carbon (C). Forest soils are an important sink of ecosystem C, though the capacity to store C may be disrupted by the elevated atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) compounds by dispersion of soil aggregates via acidification or altered microbial activity. Furthermore, dominant tree species and the lability of litter they produce can influence aggregation processes. Materials and methods: we measured water-stable aggregate size distribution and aggregate-associated organic matter (OM) content in soils from two watersheds and beneath four hardwood species at the USDA Forest Service Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA, where one watershed has received (NH4)2SO4 fertilizer since 1989 and one is a reference/control of similar stand age. Bulk soil OM, pH, and permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) were also measured. Research highlights: fertilized soil exhibited decreased macro-aggregate formation and a greater proportion of smaller micro-aggregates or unassociated clay minerals, particularly in the B-horizon. This shift in aggregation to soil more dominated by the smallest (<53 µm) fraction is associated with both acidification (soil pH) and increased microbially processed C (POXC) in fertilized soil. Intra-aggregate OM was also depleted in the fertilized soil (52% less OM in the 53–2000 µm fractions), most strongly in subsurface B-horizon soil. We also document that tree species can influence soil aggregation, as soil beneath species with more labile litter contained more OM in the micro-aggregate size class (<250 µm), especially in the fertilized watershed, while species with more recalcitrant litter promoted more OM in the macroaggregate size classes (500–2000 µm) in the reference watershed. Conclusions: long-term fertilization, and likely historic atmospheric deposition, of forest soils has weakened macro-aggregation formation, with implications for soil stability, hydrology, and storage of belowground C. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

abstract = {The reproductive processes and environmental requirements for regenerating Betula alleghaniensis, B. papyrifera, B. pendula, and B. pubescens are reviewed. Their taxonomy is confusing because somatic chromosome number varies within species, and natural hybridization is common. Paper birch and the Eurasian birches are typical species of the boreal forest, whereas yellow birch grows no farther north than 49°, from Manitoba and Minnesota eastward across North America, and somewhat farther south than paper birch. Birches do not tolerate shade, except that seedlings prosper best at about half of full sunlight, and can endure up to 90% shade. Long photoperiods are required for genetic sources from high latitudes and from high altitudes. Growth is optimum at about 18°-22°C soil and air temperatures. The birches do not use water efficiently and are sensitive to both drought and flooding. They require fertile sites for best growth and are particularly sensitive to available soil phosphorus. The response of birch to soil chemistry is genetically variable. The birches improve soils by cycling nutrients efficiently, conveying oxygen to the rooting profile, and improving soil structure and permeability. The Eurasian birches from mycorrhizal relationships with many symbionts that markedly improve growth and survival. The mycorrhizal relationships of the North American birches are meagerly documented. Birch roots adapt to difficult conditions. Roots proliferate in the upper soil, but sinkers penetrate deep soil and restrictive layers. Rootlets develop best in organic matter and penetrate decayed wood. Birch seedlings typically grow only about 1 dm tall the first year, so they are easily suppressed by faster-growing and allelochemic vegetation. Many animals, large and small, can hinder regeneration by browsing seedlings or eating seed. Fire can easily kill mature birch, but prepares good seedbeds. Surviving birches produce stress seed crops and coppice to enable regeneration. The birches begin producing seed when 10-15 years old. Seed quality is usually higher in years with warm springs and abundant flowering. The seed ripens in late summer to early autumn and disperses mostly within a few months. Less than 10% of the seed is dispersed farther than 100 m. Birch seed can retain some viability in the forest floor for up to 3 years. The birch seed-coat contains a germination inhibitor that can be neutralized by stratification or by light. Germination is generally best at about 20°-30°C and under blue-green to red wavelengths. Undisturbed litter seedbeds are too hot and dry, and physically hinder birch germination and establishment. Seedlings establish best on disturbed seedbeds consisting of mixed mineral soil and organic matter, decayed wood in particular. Burned-over humus seedbeds are overly hot and dry, and may require several years before they can support birch seedlings. In contrast, peat or Sphagnum seedbeds may remain receptive for many years. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Pyrogenic savannas with a tree–grassland ‘matrix' experience frequent fires (i.e. every 1–3 yr). Aboveground responses to frequent fires have been well studied, but responses of fungal litter decomposers, which directly affect fuels, remain poorly known. We hypothesized that each fire reorganizes belowground communities and slows litter decomposition, thereby influencing savanna fuel dynamics. In a pine savanna, we established patches near and away from pines that were either burned or unburned in that year. Within patches, we assessed fungal communities and microbial decomposition of newly deposited litter. Soil variables and plant communities were also assessed as proximate drivers of fungal communities. Fungal communities, but not soil variables or vegetation, differed substantially between burned and unburned patches. Saprotrophic fungi dominated in unburned patches but decreased in richness and relative abundance after fire. Differences in fungal communities with fire were greater in litter than in soils, but unaffected by pine proximity. Litter decomposed more slowly in burned than in unburned patches. Fires drive shifts between fire-adapted and sensitive fungal taxa in pine savannas. Slower fuel decomposition in accordance with saprotroph declines should enhance fuel accumulation and could impact future fire characteristics. Thus, fire reorganization of fungal communities may enhance persistence of these fire-adapted ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

We evaluated the AMF community through soil spore extraction and identification and root colonization rates, and we compiled the data using correlations and diversity metrics (richness, abundance and diversity). Together, we recorded thirty-six AMF species during the two sampling periods at all sites. Genera with the greatest numbers of species were Glomus, Acaulospora, Scutellospora and Gigaspora. Soil macroporosity, K and P were always higher in native forests and moisture was higher in reforested sites. Root colonization, though also affected by seasonality, showed differential behavior for each region. In addition, AMF species abundance changed between native and reforested sites and according to the season. In region 1, when correlating AMF and physical–chemical soil and litter attributes in a Redundancy Analysis, there were few differences between native and reforested sites, both being very similar. However, native and reforested sites were clearly discriminated in the other two regions, mainly influenced by bulk density, litter N, pH, Al, total porosity and moisture. The main influence in AMF dynamics composition were litter physical and chemical attributes. However, the reforestation process and seasonality, especially in summer, contributed to discriminate regions, indicating the relevance of these aspects on the AMF profile, reinforcing the importance of integrating tools in the evaluation of the biological data set. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Different leaching patterns were established between litter from coniferous trees and litter from deciduous trees. An overview is given about the physiological impact of phenolic acids on plant development. By affecting ectomycorrhizal fungi, phenolics may influence the establishment and growth of tree seedlings. Polymeric phenols in forest leaf litter (hydrolyzable and condensed tannins) have a large influence on nutrient cycling in forests and thereby on the growth conditions of plants. The allelopathic potential of species by the action of low molecular-weight phenolic acids may be influenced by the humus form prevailing under the vegetation. Implications of monomeric and polymeric phenols for vegetation processes in forests are discussed. -from Author},

abstract = {Forest pests drive tree mortality through disruption of functional traits linked to nutrient acquisition, growth and reproduction. The impacts of attack by individual or multiple above-ground herbivores on root functional traits critical to tree health have received little attention. This is especially true for exotic herbivores, organisms often found in disturbed forests. We excavated whole-root systems from eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) individuals experimentally infested with hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA: Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (EHS: Fiorina externa) individually, or in combination, for periods of 2 and 4 years. Below-ground root biomass, functional traits and storage nutrients were measured to assess impacts of herbivory. We also quantified ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) colonisation of fine roots and used culture-independent methods to examine EMF diversity. Trees infested with HWA had a greater root mass fraction (root to total biomass ratio), although feeding had no observable effects on root functional traits (e.g. specific root length) or on resource allocation to roots. HWA feeding did significantly reduce EMF colonisation of hemlock fine roots, though surprisingly, EMF diversity and that of other fungal associates were unaffected. In contrast to HWA, EHS (alone or in conjunction with HWA) feeding had no observable effect on below-ground traits or EMF colonisation alone; however, its presence mediated HWA effects when trees were co-infested. Simultaneous infestation within the same year yielded significant reductions in EMF colonisation, whereas prior EHS attack weakened HWA effects. Our results collectively suggest that prior EHS attack dampens the impact of HWA on below-ground functional traits. This highlights how the timing and sequence of herbivore arrival can alter plant-mediated interactions between herbivores and their effects on above–below-ground linkages and associated tree health.

N was added (n = 3), while at sites with a high input, N was removed by means of a transparent roof (n = 4). The experiments started between 1989 and 1991. Across the N gradient a positive correlation was found between the N concentration in deposition or soil solution with the N concentration in the needles and in general a negative correlation with the base cartons K and Mg. In the N-addition plots there was a tendency towards a decreasing nutrient status of the needles, whereas at one site N-removal led to an improvement. Addition of N hardly affected fine-root biomass production, whereas signs of growth increase were recorded when the input was reduced. Tree growth was accelerated upon input reduction at two of three sites. Manipulation of N input did not alter the decomposition rate, although significant differences between sites were noted. Manipulation of the N input hardly affected the biomass of fungi and bacteria, but a negative relation between the N-addition and part of the soil fauna may be present among sites.},

abstract = {Incident rainfall is a major source of nutrient input to a forest ecosystem and the consequent throughfall and stemflow contribute to nutrient cycling. These rain-based fluxes were measured over 12 mo in two forest types in Korup National Park, Cameroon, one with low (LEM) and one with high (HEM) ectomycorrhizal abundances of trees. Throughfall was 96.6 and 92.4% of the incident annual rainfall (5370 mm) in LEM and HEM forests respectively; stemflow was correspondingly 1.5 and 2.2%. Architectural analysis showed that In(funneling ratio) declined linearly with increasing ln(basal area) of trees. Mean annual inputs of N, P, K, Mg and Ca in incident rainfall were 1.50, 1.07, 7.77, 5.25 and 9.27 kg ha-1, and total rain-based inputs to the forest floor were 5.0, 3.2, 123.4, 14.4 and 37.7 kg ha-1 respectively. The value for K is high for tropical forests and that for N is low. Nitrogen showed a significantly lower loading of throughfall and stemflow in HEM than in LEM forest, this being associated in the HEM forest with a greater abundance of epiphytic bryophytes which may absorb more N. Incident rainfall provided c. 35% of the gross input of P to the forest floor (i.e., rain-based plus small litter inputs), a surprisingly high contribution given the sandy P-poor soils. At the start of the wet season leaching of K from the canopy was particularly high. Calcium in the rain was also highest at this time, most likely due to washing off of dry-deposited Harmattan dusts. It is proposed that throughfall has an important 'priming' function in the rapid decomposition of litter and mineralization of P at the start of the wet season. The contribution of P inputted from the atmosphere appears to be significant when compared to the rates of P mineralization from leaf litter.},

A number of biological variables had been found to decrease along the pollution gradient, e.g. soil respiration rate, microbial biomass, pine root mycorrhiza, diversity and sporophore production of mycorrhizal fungi, and the numbers of certain soil animals. Our aims were to evaluate two methods, cellulose decomposition determined in the field and cellulase activity determined in the laboratory, and to compare cellulase activity with other soil characteristics measured at the same sites. The activity of cellulase enzymes measured in the laboratory correlated well with basal respiration and correlated better with the S and N pollution gradient than the basal respiration rate. When cellulase activity was weighted toward the SIR values (substrate induced respiration), which reflect the amount of microbial biomass, it correlated best with the heavy metal concentrations in the soil especially in the most polluted stands. The decomposition of cellulose cardboard strips exposed in the field for 1 yr did not correlate with cellulase activity measured in the laboratory or with any pollution measurements, and this method seems to be too insensitive for measuring changes in microbial activities or the total decomposition process. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Mycorrhizas are the chief organ for plant mineral nutrient acquisition. In temperate, mixed forests, ash roots (Fraxinus excelsior) are colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) and beech roots (Fagus sylvatica) by ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcM). Knowledge on the functions of different mycorrhizal species that coexist in the same environment is scarce. The concentrations of nutrient elements in plant and fungal cells can inform on nutrient accessibility and interspecific differences of mycorrhizal life forms. Here, we hypothesized that mycorrhizal fungal species exhibit interspecific differences in mineral nutrient concentrations and that the differences correlate with the mineral nutrient concentrations of their associated root cells. Abundant mycorrhizal fungal species of mature beech and ash trees in a long-term undisturbed forest ecosystem were the EcM Lactarius subdulcis, Clavulina cristata and Cenococcum geophilum and the AM Glomus sp. Mineral nutrient subcellular localization and quantities of the mycorrhizas were analysed after non-aqueous sample preparation by electron dispersive X-ray transmission electron microscopy. Cenococcum geophilum contained the highest sulphur, Clavulina cristata the highest calcium levels, and Glomus, in which cations and P were generally high, exhibited the highest potassium levels. Lactarius subdulcisassociated root cells contained the highest phosphorus levels. The root cell concentrations of K, Mg and P were unrelated to those of the associated fungal structures, whereas S and Ca showed significant correlations between fungal and plant concentrations of those elements. Our results support profound interspecific differences for mineral nutrient acquisition among mycorrhizas formed by different fungal taxa. The lack of correlation between some plant and fungal nutrient element concentrations may reflect different retention of mineral nutrients in the fungal part of the symbiosis. High mineral concentrations, especially of potassium, in Glomus sp. suggest that the well-known influence of tree species on chemical soil properties may be related to their mycorrhizal associates. {\textcopyright} 2014 Seven, Polle.},

abstract = {Headwater riparian wetlands are relatively small in size but functionally significant as expected hot spots of microbial activity in the landscape. Despite their roles as biogeochemical drivers, little is known about how microbial communities in headwater riparian wetlands are affected by surrounding land-uses and land-covers (LULCs). The primary objective of this study was to determine if and how wetland soil microbial abundance and community composition varied as a function of landscape metrics as mediated through on-site edaphic properties. Forty-two soil samples, collected from eight headwater riparian wetlands in the Ridge and Valley Region of central Pennsylvania, were used for phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling of soil microbial communities. These samples were used to create microbial habitat models describing plot-level relationships between edaphic properties and microbial measures (i.e., microbial biomarker abundances, ratios and composition). Soil organic matter (SOM) content was a strong predictor of microbial biomarker abundances and fungi/bacteria ratios, while soil pH was a strong predictor of microbial composition (i.e., relative abundance of individual fatty acids) and potential microbial stress indices (i.e., cy19:0a/18:1$\omega$7c and cy17:0/16:1$\omega$7c ratios). Soil texture, soil moisture, and litter total nitrogen had smaller, but significant effects in these empirical microbial habitat models. Microbial habitat models were subsequently used to estimate microbial measures for a larger regional headwater riparian wetland dataset (n = 87), where edaphic property information was compiled. Site-average microbial measures were correlated with wetland elevation, and with landscape composition metrics in a landscape assessment area (i.e., 125,664 m2). Wetland elevation explained high among-site variability in microbial abundance measures, as mediated through SOM content, in headwater riparian wetlands in forested landscapes. However, wetland elevation was confounded by landscape composition, for headwater riparian wetland in mixed forested-agricultural landscapes. Hydrology, geomorphology, and changes in vegetation could be used to explain SOM variation across wetland elevation and variability in surrounding landscape composition. Microbial composition measures, including the cy19:0/18:1$\omega$7c ratio and principal component (PC) axes derived from 23 individual PLFA biomarkers were negatively related to the Landscape Development Intensity (LDI) index, and the percent area of row crops, pastures and grasslands, and positively related to the percent area of forest. The cy17:0/16:1$\omega$7c ratio was positively related to the LDI index, and the percent area of pasture and grasslands, and negatively related to the percent area of forest and wetland elevation. Differences along PC axes were most clearly related to the relative abundances of fungal communities; headwater riparian wetland in forested landscapes had significantly higher relative abundances of saprophytic fungi biomarkers, while headwater riparian wetland in mixed landscapes had significantly higher relative abundances of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi biomarker. This study highlights the utility of simple landscape metrics, which describe wetland position and landscape composition, for predicting differences in edaphic variability and associated microbial community composition and biomass among headwater riparian wetlands at a regional scale. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We investigated the natural abundance of 15N in sun leaves and other components of tropical rain forests on altitudinal sequences of eight sites that form a gradient of soil N availability with varying ectomycorrhizal abundances on Mt. Kinabalu. Borneo. We investigated how soil N availability and ectomycorrhizal abundance related to the 15N abundance of ecosystem components. $\delta$15N values (15N abundance relative to 14N) increased consistently in the following order at each site: sun leaves, leaf litter, fine roots and from shallower organic to deeper mineral soil horizons. Enrichment (3-6‰ $\delta$15N) of 15N occurred at the litter-topsoil interface at all sites, and the magnitude of the enrichment correlated negatively with 15N depletion in the foliage, irrespective of ectomycorrhizal abundance. Foliar $\delta$15N values significantly positively correlated with their N concentrations. Foliar (and litter and root) $\delta$15N values correlated positively with NO3 availability, and negatively with NH4 availability. The two positive correlations of foliar $\delta$15N with foliar N and NO3 availability were inconsistent with the assumption that stronger nitrification (hence a greater nitrate availability) produced a more 15N-depleted active inorganic N pool. The isotopic fractionation during the passage of N through ectomycorrhizas to plants might explain the positive correlation of foliar $\delta$15N and N concentration; however, this mechanism could not fully explain the correlation in our case because strong foliar 15N depletions occurred at the sites that lacked ectomycorrhizas. Alternatively, the positive correlation across sites reflected the tightness of N cycling. Strong nitrification and associated isotopic fractionation might have occurred at N-richer sites and the subsequent removal of NO3 from the system could decrease isotopically 'lighter' N at these sites.},

While many fungi may be considered generalists that are able to utilize complex biomass of plant, bacterial, and fungal origin, it is less clear which of the individual biopolymers that compose these substrates they utilize. Here we analysed fungal communities in forest topsoil enriched in bags with polymers composing plant (cellulose, xylan, glucomannan, pectin, lignin) and fungal (chitin, $\beta$-1,3-glucan, and $\beta$-1,3-1,6-glucan) biomass along with fungal abundance and the activity of enzymes. There was a high degree of specialization among saprotrophs, each biopolymer being preferred by distinct taxa. White-rot fungi and general saprotrophs were most common on cellulose and xylan, while pectin and lignin-associated communities were dominated by moulds, and animal pathogens were found almost exclusively on chitin. Although several enzymes were produced on all biopolymers, the composition of enzyme pools was significantly different among substrates and different from litter. Activity of endocellulase, $\beta$-galactosidase, $\beta$-mannosidase, and $\beta$-glucosidase significantly correlated with the fungal to bacterial biomass ratio indicating the important role of fungi in their production. The results indicate the high level of specialization among litter-inhabiting fungi and differences in the substrate preference across nutritional guilds of saprotrophic fungi. While most of the litter-inhabiting fungi utilize plant biopolymers, fungal biopolymers are also frequently targeted. {\textcopyright} 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {Orchids require mycorrhizal fungi for germination of seed and growth of seedlings. The colonisation of bauxite-mine rehabilitation areas by orchids is therefore dependent on the availability of both seed and mycorrhizal fungi. Orchid mycorrhizal fungi baiting trials were carried out in rehabilitation areas that were 1, 10 and 26 years old (established in 2001, 1992 and 1976) and adjacent unmined jarrah forest areas at Jarrahdale, Western Australia. Fungal baits consisted of buried six-chambered nylon-mesh packets containing seed of six jarrah forest orchid taxa, Caladenia flava subsp. flava R.Br., Disa bracteata Sw., Microtis media subsp. media R.Br., Pterostylis recurva Benth., Pyrorchis nigricans (R.Br.) D.L.Jones & M.A.Clem. and Thelymitra crinita Lindl. Detection of orchid mycorrhizal fungi was infrequent, especially at the youngest rehabilitation sites where only mycorrhizal fungi associated with P. recurva were detected. Mycorrhizal fungi of the other orchid taxa were widespread but sparsely distributed in older rehabilitation and forest areas. Detection of mycorrhizal fungi varied between taxa and baiting sites for the two survey years (2002 and 2004). Caladenia flava subsp. flava and T. crinita mycorrhizal fungi were the most frequently detected. The presence of C. flava mycorrhizal fungi was correlated with leafy litter cover and maximum depth, and soil moisture at the vegetation type scale (50 × 5 m belt transects), as well as tree and litter cover at the microhabitat scale (1-m2 quadrats). The presence of T. crinita mycorrhizal fungi was positively correlated with soil moisture in rehabilitation areas and low shrub cover in forest. The frequency of detection of orchid mycorrhizal fungi both at rehabilitated sites (15-25% of baits) and in unmined forest (15-50% of baits) tended to increase with rehabilitation age as vegetation recovered. The failure of some orchid taxa to reinvade rehabilitation areas is unlikely to be entirely due to absence of the appropriate mycorrhizal fungi. However, since the infrequent detection of fungi suggests that they occur in isolated patches of soil, the majority of dispersed orchid seeds are likely to perish, especially in recently disturbed habitats. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2007.},

abstract = {Winter air temperatures are rising faster than summer air temperatures in high-latitude forests, increasing the frequency of soil freeze/thaw events in winter. To determine how climate warming and soil freeze/thaw cycles affect soil microbial communities and the ecosystem processes they drive, we leveraged the Climate Change across Seasons Experiment (CCASE) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the northeastern United States, where replicate field plots receive one of three climate treatments: warming (+5°C above ambient in the growing season), warming in the growing season + winter freeze/thaw cycles (+5°C above ambient +4 freeze/thaw cycles during winter), and no treatment. Soil samples were taken from plots at six time points throughout the growing season and subjected to amplicon (rDNA) and metagenome sequencing. We found that soil fungal and bacterial community composition were affected by changes in soil temperature, where the taxonomic composition of microbial communities shifted more with the combination of growing-season warming and increased frequency of soil freeze/thaw cycles in winter than with warming alone. Warming increased the relative abundance of brown rot fungi and plant pathogens but decreased that of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, all of which recovered under combined growing-season warming and soil freeze/thaw cycles in winter. The abundance of animal parasites increased significantly under combined warming and freeze/thaw cycles. We also found that warming and soil freeze/thaw cycles suppressed bacterial taxa with the genetic potential for carbon (i.e., cellulose) decomposition and soil nitrogen cycling, such as N fixation and the final steps of denitrification. These new soil communities had higher genetic capacity for stress tolerance and lower genetic capacity to grow or reproduce, relative to the communities exposed to warming in the growing season alone. Our observations suggest that initial suppression of biogeochemical cycling with year-round climate change may be linked to the emergence of taxa that trade-off growth for stress tolerance traits. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020 Garcia, Templer, Sorensen, Sanders-DeMott, Groffman and Bhatnagar.},

Sporocarps of Mesophellia and Castorium develop 5‐20 cm below the soil surface in close association with eucalypt roots. During differentiation of the sporocarps, eucalypt roots become trapped within the peridium where they branch profusely and form a dense ectomycorrhizal layer. Mature sporocarps of M. trabalis nom. ined. contain approximately S m of roots of 45 cm2 surface area. Anatomical studies have shown that these roots have Hartig nets penetrating to the hypodermis and are similar to the superficial eucalypt ectomycorrhizas formed in soil and litter. The association of Mesophellia and Castorium sporocarps with tree roots suggests that these are important mycorrhizal fungi in forests of southern Australia.

However, the relative contribution of basal resources to these channels for nutrition of higher trophic levels is largely unknown. 2.The study took advantage of the Swiss Canopy Crane Project, where a mature temperate forest was labelled with 13C-depleted CO 2. By exchanging leaf litter between the 13CO 2-enriched area and an unlabelled control area, we were able to separate carbon fluxes originating from leaf litter and roots, respectively. 3.Fatty acid (FA) composition and $\delta$ 13C signatures of individual FAs of basal resources and soil animals, including decomposers and predators, were analysed. Marker FAs allowed differentiation of the contribution of plant litter, fungi and bacteria to the nutrition of higher trophic levels. 4.Our findings suggest that root-derived carbon is of major importance for the soil animal food web and that it enters the soil animal food web mainly via feeding on ectomycorrhizal fungi. 5.In contrast to previous studies that emphasized the dominance of the fungal energy channel, significant amounts of bacterial FAs in each of the predator species studied indicate that the bacterial energy channel is considerably more important for the nutrition of higher trophic levels than previously assumed. The flux of energy along the two channels presumably contributes to food web stability. 6.Compound-specific 13(CO 2) FA analysis of basal resources and soil animals allowed the separation of energy fluxes originating from ectomycorrhizal vs. saprotrophic fungi, from bacteria feeding on leaf litter vs. bacteria feeding on root exudates, and from leaf litter itself, providing information on the partitioning of these different energy channels in unprecedented detail. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

A gradient in forest floor thickness exists across these plantations; the forest floor is thickest in the west and it becomes progressively thinner toward the east. Decomposition of imported litter increased from west to east, suggesting that the variation in forest floor thickness is related to variation in the rate of decomposition. Decomposition rates were related to saprotroph abundance. Variation in forest floor N and phenolic concentrations, in overall mycorrhiza density and in the relative proportions of three common mycorrhiza morphotypes could not explain the variation in decomposition rate. The P concentrations and pH of the forest floor were significantly lower at Clear Creek and Moshannon, where decomposition rates were lowest, compared to Sproul and Tiadaghton, where decomposition rates were most rapid. This suggests that P concentration and pH may have exerted some control on decomposition.},

In complex forest soils, trees undoubtedly benefit from the well-adapted nutrient acquisition strategies evolved in the huge diversity of ECM fungi that occupy the numerous niches in the different soil types. As with all organisms, mycorrhizal fungi feature genes encoding proteins involved in trace element acquisition, storage and remobilization to assure cellular homeostasis regardless of natural external fluctuations. A constant cellular concentration of essential trace elements is required to secure growth and reproduction and to overcome toxicity. Transcriptome analysis is the most prominently used approach to identify genes and gene products involved in trace element homeostasis. Imbalances in the cellular homeostasis of trace elements, even brief ones, produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can be generated directly by redox-active elements or indirectly by redox-inactive elements. {\textcopyright} 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.},

The functionality of ECM is largely dependent on the ability of the host plant to supply photoassimilates to the fungus via the symbiotic interface. Based on sterile in vitro and non-sterile pot experiments, we review data which gives evidence that hexoses are supplied to the fungus by the host plant (mainly glucose and fructose), and that these sugars, at least in part, control development and function of ECM by interfering with fungal gene expression. We further show that any factor which reduces hexose allocation to the host-fungus interface will adversely affect ECM development. As an example, we address the impact of increased supply of nitrogen on the biochemistry of plant-fungus interaction and discuss potential consequences on host performance.},

abstract = {Humans have dramatically increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition globally. At the coarsest resolution, N deposition is correlated with shifts from ectomycorrhizal (EcM) to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree dominance. At finer resolution, ectomycorrhizal fungal (EcMF) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities respond strongly to long-term N deposition with the disappearance of key taxa. Conifer-associated EcMF are more sensitive than other EcMF, with current estimates of critical loads at 5–6 kg ha−1 yr−1 for the former and 10–20 kg ha−1 yr−1 for the latter. Where loads are exceeded, strong plant-soil and microbe-soil feedbacks may slow recovery rates after abatement of N deposition. Critical loads for AMF and tropical EcMF require additional study. In general, the responses of EcMF to N deposition are better understood than those of AMF because of methodological tractability. Functional consequences of EcMF community change are linked to decreases by fungi with medium-distance exploration strategies, hydrophobic walls, proteolytic capacity, and perhaps peroxidases for acquiring N from soil organic matter. These functional losses may contribute to declines in forest floor decomposition under N deposition. For AMF, limited capacity to directly access complexed organic N may reduce functional consequences, but research is needed to test this hypothesis. Mycorrhizal biomass often declines with N deposition, but the relative contributions of alternate mechanisms for this decline (lower C supply, higher C cost, physiological stress by N) have not been quantified. Furthermore, fungal biomass and functional responses to N inputs probably depend on ecosystem P status, yet how N deposition-induced P limitation interacts with belowground C flux and mycorrhizal community structure and function is still unclear. Current ‘omic analyses indicate potential functional differences among fungal lineages and should be integrated with studies of physiology, host nutrition, growth and health, fungal and plant community structure, and ecosystem processes. Forest mycorrhizal fungal community composition responds strongly to N deposition across broad ranges of spatial, temporal and phylogenetic scales, with functional consequences—including altered tree nutrition and C, N, and P cycling—that are substantial but only partially understood. {\textcopyright} 2018},

Thus, we evaluated the effect of spatial and climatic characteristics on the soil–plant nitrogen dynamics in three representative larch stands (Larix sibirica) with different geographical and climatic conditions using stable nitrogen isotopes. The results showed significant differences in the soil inorganic N content among sites and consequently a different isotopic composition in the plant–soil system. Litter, bark and wood had the lowest $\delta$15N values for all sites, slightly higher $\delta$15N values for needles, while the highest $\delta$15N values were observed for roots and soil. These differences could be the result of the larch stands age themselves, but were in agreement with the spatial and climatic characteristics of the sites. Based on the $\delta$15N value a higher reliance on ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF) was observed in the warmest and driest site, while lower dependency was shown in the cooler northern site with higher soil inorganic N content. In both sites, the rate of air temperature increase has been similar in the last decades; however, their soil–plant N dynamics showed different characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2018, {\textcopyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract = {As the number of drought occurrences has been predicted to increase with increasing temperatures, it is believed that boreal forests will become particularly vulnerable to decreased growth and increased tree mortality caused by the hydraulic failure, carbon starvation and vulnerability to pests following these. Although drought-affected trees are known to have stunted growth, as well as increased allocation of carbon to roots, still not enough is known about the ways in which trees can acclimate to drought. We studied how drought stress affects belowground and aboveground carbon dynamics, as well as nitrogen uptake, in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings exposed to prolonged drought. Overall 40 Scots pine seedlings were divided into control and drought treatments over two growing seasons. Seedlings were pulse-labelled with 13CO2 and litter bags containing 15N-labelled root biomass, and these were used to follow nutrient uptake of trees. We determined photosynthesis, biomass distribution, root and rhizosphere respiration, water potential, leaf osmolalities and carbon and nitrogen assimilation patterns in both treatments. The photosynthetic rate of the drought-induced seedlings did not decrease compared to the control group, the maximum leaf specific photosynthetic rate being 0.058 and 0.045 $\mu$ mol g-1 s-1 for the drought and control treatments, respectively. The effects of drought were, however, observed as lower water potentials, increased osmolalities as well as decreased growth and greater fine root-to-shoot ratio in the drought-treated seedlings. We also observed improved uptake of labelled nitrogen from soil to needles in the drought-treated seedlings. The results indicate acclimation of seedlings to long-term drought by aiming to retain sufficient water uptake with adequate allocation to roots and root-associated mycorrhizal fungi. The plants seem to control water potential with osmolysis, for which sufficient photosynthetic capability is needed. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Author.},

abstract = {Many trees form ectomycorrhizal symbiosis with fungi. During symbiosis, the tree roots supply sugar to the fungi in exchange for nitrogen, and this process is critical for the nitrogen and carbon cycles in forest ecosystems. However, the extents to which ectomycorrhizal fungi can liberate nitrogen and modify the soil organic matter and the mechanisms by which they do so remain unclear since they have lost many enzymes for litter decomposition that were present in their free-living, saprotrophic ancestors. Using time-series spectroscopy and transcriptomics, we examined the ability of two ectomycorrhizal fungi from two independently evolved ectomycorrhizal lineages to mobilize soil organic nitrogen. Both species oxidized the organic matter and accessed the organic nitrogen. The expression of those events was controlled by the availability of glucose and inorganic nitrogen. Despite those similarities, the decomposition mechanisms, including the type of genes involved as well as the patterns of their expression, differed markedly between the two species. Our results suggest that in agreement with their diverse evolutionary origins, ectomycorrhizal fungi use different decomposition mechanisms to access organic nitrogen entrapped in soil organic matter. The timing and magnitude of the expression of the decomposition activity can be controlled by the below-ground nitrogen quality and the above-ground carbon supply. {\textcopyright} 2018, International Society for Microbial Ecology.},

abstract = {Microbial respiration in dead wood contributes substantially to the long-lived forest carbon (C) pool and has a significant role in the forest nitrogen (N) cycle. Wood N content has been found to increase during the decay process; however, temporal dynamics and the sources of this external N remain unclear. To examine N dynamics at various stages of decomposition, we combined high variety of analytical methods on Norway spruce logs, including wood $\delta$15N, N%, 14C-dating, fungal composition and N2 fixation rate. For N2 fixation rate, we also determined its dependency on ambient temperature and decay class, when estimating annual N2 fixation rates for our study site. N2 fixation was observed to have a major role in increasing wood N content during decay. For the most decayed wood, it accounted for 60% of the total N accumulation. Compared to other reports, where the annual temperature was similar to our site, the calculated annual fixation rate of 85 g N ha−1 year−1 is a low estimate. However, previous studies have not taken appropriately into account the dependency of N2 fixation rate on ambient temperature and decay class. Our $\delta$15N model describing the sources of external N, statistical analysis and the fungal DNA composition of decayed wood suggest that other sources of external N accumulating in wood were soil-foraging wood-decay fungi and mycorrhizal fungi. Our study improves knowledge of the temporal dynamics of N accumulation in wood with advancing wood decay, the potential sources of external N and their relative significance. All of these factors are important for nitrogen as well as carbon models dealing with ecosystem responses to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

abstract = {Establishment of native grasses is a primary objective of restoration in Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum (P. & C. Lawson) forests in the southwestern United States. Interactions among native grasses and soil microorganisms generate feedbacks that influence the achievement of this objective. We examined soil chemical properties and communities of plants and soil microorganisms in clear-cuts and P. ponderosa stands thinned and maintained at low and medium tree densities for over 40 years along with high density (unthinned) stands. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in soils were analyzed to examine arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and microbial communities in the three thinning treatments and the unthinned stands with and without a recent broadcast burn. Additionally, two native bunchgrasses, Festuca arizonica and Muhlenbergia wrightii were grown in containers filled with intact soil cores collected from each field plot to more thoroughly compare the abundance of AM fungi and microbial communities across different stand densities and burn treatments. Tree thinning decreased litter cover and increased the abundance and diversity and altered community composition of both herbaceous vegetation and AM fungi. In the mineral soil layer, the pH, total carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and PLFA profiles did not differ significantly among the four stand density or burn treatments. Mycorrhizal colonization of the container grown grasses did not significantly differ with tree density or burn treatments; however, F. arizonica roots had a strong trend for decreased colonization when grown in soil from high density (unthinned) tree cover. Soil from the containers with F. arizonica had a greater abundance of AM fungal spores. Furthermore, bacterial community composition varied with grass species. Concentration of biomarkers for bacteria were higher in soil that supported F. arizonica compared to soil in which M. wrightii was grown. Our results indicate that the creation of clear-cut openings in forests may increase the abundance and richness of AM fungal propagules and soil bacterial communities were surprisingly resilient to tree thinning and low-intensity fire treatments. These results suggest managing forests to create clear-cut openings generate conditions that favor understory native grasses and AM fungi that are linked to soil bacterial communities. {\textcopyright} 2015.},

abstract = {The relative diversity and abundance of different functional groups of macrofungi were investigated in the northern jarrah forest, a mediterranean climate sclerophyllous forest dominated by eucalyptus trees in Western Australia. We sampled paired sites that were either severely affected by dieback, a disease caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi which causes selective plant mortality, or unaffected by this type of forest decline. Macrofungi were sampled 3 times during the growing season along six 100 m × 2 m transects in these sites. Dieback-unaffected sites were found to have significantly different macrofungal floras than unaffected sites. Macrofungal abundance and diversity were approximately 1.5 times and 1.8 times greater respectively in dieback-unaffected sites than in severely affected sites. Dieback-affected sites had a similar diversity of saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi, whereas more fungal taxa on dieback-unaffected sites were mycorrhizal (>60%). Dung fungi were the most common saprophytes, especially in dieback-affected sites, but abundance data greatly overestimated the importance of these relatively small fungi. We concluded that vegetation changes linked to dieback had a negative effect on fungal community structure and biodiversity in the northern jarrah forest, in a similar manner to other forms of severe disturbance. Conversely, high tree mortality increased the abundance of wood decay fungi, at least in the short term. We expect that reductions in macrofungal species richness were indirectly linked to impacts on mycorrhizal host plants and saprotrophic substrates. Our data show that changes in vegetation composition had the greatest effect on ectomycorrhizal fungi, presumably due to their obligate symbiotic associations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous in tropical forests. AMF play a role in the forest carbon cycle because they can increase nutrient acquisition and biomass of host plants, but also incur a carbon cost to the plant. Through their interactions with their host plants they have the potential to affect how plants respond to environmental perturbation such as global warming. Our objective was to experimentally determine how plant respiration rates and responses to warmer environment are affected by AMF colonization in seedlings of five tropical tree species at the whole plant level. We evaluated the interaction between AMF colonization and temperature on plant respiration against four possible outcomes; acclimation does or does not occur regardless of AMF, or AMF can increase or decrease respiratory acclimation. Seedlings were inoculated with AMF spores or sterilized inoculum and grown at ambient or elevated nighttime temperature. We measured whole plant and belowground respiration rates, as well as plant growth and biomass allocation. There was an overall increase in whole plant, root, and shoot respiration rate with AMF colonization, whereas temperature acclimation varied among species, showing support for three of the four possible responses. The influence of AMF colonization on growth and allocation also varied among plant species. This study shows that the effect of AMF colonization on acclimation differs among plant species. Given the cosmopolitan nature of AMF and the importance of plant acclimation for predicting climate feedbacks a better understanding of the patterns and mechanisms of acclimation is essential for improving predictions of how climate warming may influence vegetation feedbacks. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

abstract = {The atmospheric concentration of CO2 is predicted to reach double current levels by 2075. Detritus from aboveground and belowground plant parts constitutes the primary source of C for soil organic matter (SOM), and accumulation of SOM in forests may provide a significant mechanism to mitigate increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In a poplar (three species) plantation exposed to ambient (380 ppm) and elevated (580 ppm) atmospheric CO2 concentrations using a Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) system, the relative importance of leaf litter decomposition, fine root and fungal turnover for C incorporation into SOM was investigated. A technique using cores of soil in which a C4 crop has been grown ($\delta$13C -18.1‰) inserted into the plantation and detritus from C3 trees ($\delta$13C -27 to -30‰) was used to distinguish between old (native soil) and new (tree derived) soil C. In-growth cores using a fine mesh (39 $\mu$m) to prevent in-growth of roots, but allow in-growth of fungal hyphae were used to assess contribution of fine roots and the mycorrhizal external mycelium to soil C during a period of three growing seasons (1999-2001). Across all species and treatments, the mycorrhizal external mycelium was the dominant pathway (62%) through which carbon entered the SOM pool, exceeding the input via leaf litter and fine root turnover. The input via the mycorrhizal external mycelium was not influenced by elevated CO2, but elevated atmospheric CO2 enhanced soil C inputs via fine root turnover. The turnover of the mycorrhizal external mycelium may be a fundamental mechanism for the transfer of root-derived C to SOM. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

abstract = {The decomposition and the fate of 15N-labelled beech litter was monitored in a beech forest (Vosges mountains, France) over 3 years. Circular plots around beech trees were isolated from neighbouring tree roots by soil trenching. After removal of the litter layer, 15N-labelled litter was distributed on the soil. Samples [labelled litter, soil (0-15 cm depths], fine roots, mycorrhizal root tips, leaves) were collected during the subsequent vegetation periods and analysed for total N and 15N concentration. Mass loss of the 15N-labelled litter was estimated using mass loss data from a litterbag experiment set up at the field site. An initial and rapid release of soluble N from the decomposing litter was balanced by the incorporation of exogenous N into the litter. Fungal N accounted for approximately 35% of the N incorporation. Over 2 years, litter N was continuously released and rates of N and mass loss were equivalent, while litter N was preferentially lost during the 3rd year. Released 15N accumulated essentially at the soil surface. 15N from the decomposing litter was rapidly (i.e. in 6 months) detected in roots and beech leaves and its level increased regularly and linearly over the course of the labelling experiment. After 3 years, about 2% of the original litter N had accumulated in the trees. 15N budgets indicated that soluble N was the main source for soil microbial biomass. Nitrogen accumulated in storage compounds was the main source of leaf N, while soil organic N was the main source of mycorrhizal N. Use of 15N-labelled beech litter as decomposing substrate allowed assessment of the fate of litter N in the soil and tree N pools in a beech forest on different time scales.},

abstract = {(1) While it is well-known that trees release carbon (C) to soils as root exudates, the factors that control the magnitude and biogeochemical impacts of this flux are poorly understood.(2) We quantified root exudation and microbially-mediated nutrient fluxes in the rhizosphere for four $\sim$80 year-old tree species in a deciduous hardwood forest, Indiana, USA. We hypothesized that trees that exuded the most carbon (C) would induce the strongest rhizosphere effects (i.e., the relative difference in nutrient fluxes between rhizosphere and bulk soil). Further, we hypothesized that tree species that associate with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi would exude more C than tree species that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, resulting in a greater enhancement of nutrient cycling in ECM rhizospheres.(3) Mass-specific exudation rates and rhizosphere effects on C, N and P cycling were nearly two-fold greater for the two ECM tree species compared to the two AM tree species (P<0.05). Moreover, across all species, exudation rates were positively correlated with multiple indices of nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition in the rhizosphere (P<0.05). Annually, we estimate that root exudation represents 2.5% of NPP in this forest, and that the exudate-induced changes in microbial N cycling may contribute $\sim$18% of total net N mineralization.(4) Collectively, our results indicate that the effects of roots on nutrient cycling are consequential, particularly in forests where the C cost of mining nutrients from decomposing soil organic matter may be greatest (e.g., ECM-dominated stands). Further, our results suggest that small C fluxes from exudation may have disproportionate impacts on ecosystem N cycling in nutrient-limited forests. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

At each site, comparable disturbed and undisturbed plots were selected. Disturbance reduced ground cover vegetation and leaf litter. Beech seedlings had lower biomass after disturbance. Ergosterol concentration in seedling roots, an indicator of mycorrhizal fungi, was lower in two of the four disturbed plots compared to undisturbed plots; these two disturbed sites had especially low litter levels. Based on ergosterol measurements, mycorrhizas of mature trees did not appear to be negatively affected by trampling. Total fine roots and SOM were higher in the disturbed than in the undisturbed plots at three sites. At the fourth site, fine roots and SOM in the disturbed areas were lower than in the undisturbed areas most probably due to nutrient input following picnic activities. Principal component analysis revealed a close correlation between SOM and fine roots of mature trees as well as litter and seedling biomass. Trampling due to recreational activities caused considerable damage to the vegetation layer and in particular to the beech seedlings and their mycorrhizal fine roots, whereas, roots of mature trees were apparently resilient to trampling.},

abstract = {The convergent evolution of polyphenol-rich plant communities has occurred on highly acidic and infertile soils throughout the world. The pygmy forest in coastal northern California is an example of an ecosystem on an extremely infertile soil that has exceptionally high concentrations of polyphenols. Many 'negative feedbacks' have been identified whereby plants degrade fertile soils through production of polyphenol-rich litter, sequestering soil nutrients into unavailable form and creating unfavorable conditions for seed germination, root growth, and nutrient uptake. But in the context of plant-litter-soil interactions in ecosystems adapted to soils that are inherently acidic and infertile (such as the pygmy forest), there are also many 'positive feedbacks' that result from polyphenol production. By inhibiting decomposition, polyphenols regulate the formation of a mor-humus litter layer, conserving nutrients and creating a more favorable medium for root growth. Polyphenols shift the dominant pathway of nitrogen cycling from mineral to organic forms to minimize potential N losses from the ecosystem and maximize litter-N recovery by mycorrhizal symbionts. Polyphenol complexation of Al, Mn and Fe reduce potential A1 toxicity and P fixation in soil. Polyphenols regulate organic matter dynamics, leading to the accumulation of organic matter with cation exchange capacity to minimize leaching of nutrient cations. Humic substances derived from polyphenolic precursors coat rhizosphere soil surfaces, improving physical and chemical conditions for root growth and nutrient cycling. Although their long-accepted adaptive value for antiherbivore defense is now in doubt, polyphenol alteration of soil conditions and regulation of nutrient cycling illustrate how fitness can be influenced by the 'extended' phenotype in plant-litter-soil interactions.},

abstract = {Poor growth of conifer regeneration occurred on sites formerly occupied by old-growth cedar-hemlock (CH) forests in coastal British Columbia, 5-8 years after clearcutting and slashburning. Symptoms included chlorotic foliage and growth check of Sitka spruce, western hemlock, western red cedar and amabilis fir, coincident with the expansion of the ericaceous shrub, salal, on the cutovers. Fertilization trials identified N and P deficiencies as the cause of the growth check o f conifers, and additions of 300 kg N ha-1 and 100 kg P ha-1 significantly improved tree growth rates. Equivalent growth responses were achieved with additions of sewage sludge and fish silage. Burning, cultivating, liming, higher planting densities or herbicide application, were less effective in promoting conifer growth. The nutrient deficiencies in conifers on CH cutovers were the result of two factors: low nutrient availability in soil and humus, and competition and interference from salal. Salal immobilized substantial amounts of N in biomass and an in vitro study suggested it was able to use organic forms of N through its mycorrhizal fungi. The mycorrhizae of salal also interfered with those of hemlock, which further reduced their ability to take up nutrients. High concentrations of phenolic acids were associated with salal, which interfere with mineralization and uptake of N. The low availability of N and P in CH cutovers originated in forest floors of the old- growth forests prior to clearcutting. Nutrient availability was low in all layers of the forest floor in CH forests, and this appeared to result from three main factors. First, cedar litter contains less N and more decay- resistant material than other species, and produces forest floors with low rates of N mineralization. Second, the forest floors in CH forests are wetter and have less soil fauna than in HA forests, leading to incomplete decomposition and mineralization of N. Third, the salal understory in CH forests interferes with mineralization of N through the production of tannins.},

abstract = {The origins and composition of soil organic matter (SOM) are still largely uncertain. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are recognized as indirect contributors through their influence on soil aggregation, plant physiology, and plant community composition. Here we present evidence that AMF can also make large, direct contributions to SOM. Glomalin, a recently discovered glycoprotein produced by AMF hyphae, was detected in tropical soils in concentrations of over 60 mg cm-3. Along a chronosequence of soils spanning ages from 300 to 4.1 Mio years, a pattern of glomalin concentrations is consistent with the hypothesis that this protein accumulates in soil. Carbon dating of glomalin indicated turnover at time scales of several years to decades, much longer than the turnover of AMF hyphae (which is assumed to be on the order of days to weeks). This suggests that contributions of mycorrhizae to soil carbon storage based on hyphal biomass in soil and roots may be an underestimate. The amount of C and N in glomalin represented a sizeable amount (ca. 4-5%) of total soil C and N in the oldest soils. Our results thus indicate that microbial (fungal) carbon that is not derived from above- or below-ground litter can make a significant contribution to soil carbon and nitrogen pools and can far exceed the contributions of soil microbial biomass (ranging from 0.08 to 0.2% of total C for the oldest soils).},

abstract = {In forest ecosystems, ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi play a central role in the breakdown of soil organic matter (SOM). Competition between these two fungal guilds has long been hypothesized to lead to suppression of decomposition rates, a phenomenon known as the 'Gadgil effect'. In this review, we examine the documentation, generality, and potential mechanisms involved in the 'Gadgil effect'. We find that the influence of ectomycorrhizal fungi on litter and SOM decomposition is much more variable than previously recognized. To explain the inconsistency in size and direction of the 'Gadgil effect', we argue that a better understanding of underlying mechanisms is required. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of the primary mechanisms proposed to date and how using different experimental methods (trenching, girdling, microcosms), as well as considering different temporal and spatial scales, could influence the conclusions drawn about this phenomenon. Finally, we suggest that combining new research tools such as high-throughput sequencing with experiments utilizing natural environmental gradients will significantly deepen our understanding of the 'Gadgil effect' and its consequences on forest soil carbon and nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2016 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract = {Aims: In the Swedish sub-Arctic, mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) forests mediate rapid soil C cycling relative to adjacent tundra heaths, but little is known about the role of individual trees within forests. Here we investigate the spatial extent over which trees influence soil processes. Methods: We measured respiration, soil C stocks, root and mycorrhizal productivity and fungi:bacteria ratios at fine spatial scales along 3 m transects extending radially from mountain birch trees in a sub-Arctic ecotone forest. Root and mycorrhizal productivity was quantified using in-growth techniques and fungi:bacteria ratios were determined by qPCR. Results: Neither respiration, nor root and mycorrhizal production, varied along transects. Fungi:bacteria ratios, soil organic C stocks and standing litter declined with increasing distance from trees. Conclusions: As 3 m is half the average size of forest gaps, these findings suggest that forest soil environments are efficiently explored by roots and associated mycorrhizal networks of B. pubescens. Individual trees exert influence substantially away from their base, creating more uniform distributions of root, mycorrhizal and bacterial activity than expected. However, overall rates of soil C accumulation do vary with distance from trees, with potential implications for spatio-temporal soil organic matter dynamics and net ecosystem C sequestration. {\textcopyright} 2019, The Author(s).},

The current upsurge in mycorrhizal research has also generated new approaches to integrated studies of fungi in soil, litter, and roots. Whatever the shortcomings of old and new methods of studying soil fungi, investigators' claims have tended to become more reliable with wider recognition that the use of sound statistical techniques when designing experiments and handling numerical data is essential. Statistical analyses are not discussed in this chapter, but some useful references are mentioned.

No spatial autocorrelation was found for AMF in the control sites. However, pronounced patchiness was characteristic of both SF and AMF communities within 10 m of contaminated sites. In the contaminated area, no specific spatial structure determinants of the studied communities was found among environmental factors such as water content, heavy metal concentrations in the forest litter, sample plot localization relative to canopy density, and herb vegetation diversity and abundance.

abstract = {Managers use restorative fire and thinning for ecological benefits and to convert fuel-heavy forests to fuel-lean landscapes that lessen the threat of stand-replacing wildfire. In this study, we evaluated the long-term impact of thinning and prescribed fire on soil biochemistry and the mycorrhizal fungi associated with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Study sites were located in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon where prescribed fire treatments implemented in 1998 and thinning treatments in 2000 included prescribed fire, mechanical thinning of forested areas, a combination of thinning followed by fire, and an untreated control. Soil sampling for this study occurred in 2014 and included four replications of each treatment for a total of 16 experimental units. Differences among treatments in Bray-P, total C and N, and pH were likely driven by the thinning treatments and the resultant deposition of residual slash following harvesting or the consumption of slash by prescribed fire. Similar litter depths across treatments suggest that litter depth stabilizes over time in these forests. After more than a decade of recovery, mycorrhizal fungi in dry inland forests dominated by ponderosa pine that were subjected to fire returned to levels similar to the untreated controls. The results of this study demonstrate the resiliency of these forests to disturbances associated with restoration treatments, providing managers increased flexibility if maintaining abundant and persistent fungal communities for healthy soils is an objective. {\textcopyright} 2018},

The inorganic N leaching from each soil substrate was taken as a measure of N availability. Although there was no significant difference in total N leaching among substrates, more NH 4+-N leached from the decomposing organic material than other substrates. Rapid fine root production was observed in the organic material, whereas root production in the litter substrate was suppressed. Annual net fine root productions in litter, organic material, and mineral soil were 51, 193, and 132 g m-2, respectively. In the leaf litter substrate, AM colonization was suppressed and specific root length was higher than in the other substrates, indicating severe nutrient limitation in the litter.

abstract = {Fine root acclimation to different environmental conditions is crucial for growth and sustainability of forest trees. Relatively small changes in fine root standing biomass (FRB), morphology or mycorrhizal symbiosis may result in a large change in forest carbon, nutrient and water cycles. We elucidated the changes in fine root traits and associated ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi in 12 Norway spruce stands across a climatic and N deposition gradient from subarctic-boreal to temperate regions in Europe (68°N-48°N). We analysed the standing FRB and the ectomycorrhizal root tip biomass (EcMB, g m -2) simultaneously with measurements of the EcM root morphological traits (e.g. mean root length, root tissue density (RTD), N% in EcM roots) and frequency of dominating EcM fungi in different stands in relation to climate, soil and site characteristics. Latitude and N deposition explained the greatest proportion of variation in fine root traits. EcMB per stand basal area (BA) increased exponentially with latitude: by about 12.7 kg m -2 with an increase of 10° latitude from southern Germany to Estonia and southern Finland and by about 44.7 kg m -2 with next latitudinal 10° from southern to northern Finland. Boreal Norway spruce forests had 4.5 to 11 times more EcM root tips per stand BA, and the tips were 2.1 times longer, with 1.5 times higher RTD and about 1/3 lower N concentration. There was 19% higher proportion of root tips colonized by long-distance exploration type forming EcM fungi in the southern forests indicating importance of EcM symbiont foraging strategy in fine root nutrient acquisition. In the boreal zone, we predict ca. 50% decrease in EcMB per stand BA with an increase of 2 °C annual mean temperature. Different fine root foraging strategies in boreal and temperate forests highlight the importance of complex studies on respective regulatory mechanisms in changing climate. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The interactions between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and mineral particles are critical for the stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) in terrestrial ecosystems. The processing of DOM by ectomycorrhizal fungi contributes to the formation of mineral-stabilized SOM by two contrasting pathways: the extracellular transformation of DOM (ex vivo pathway) and the secretion of mineral-surface-reactive metabolites (in vivo pathway). In this study, we examined how changes in nitrogen (N) availability affected the formation of mineral-associated carbon (C) from these two pathways. DOM was extracted from forest soils. The processing of this DOM by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus was examined in laboratory-scale studies with different levels of ammonium. At low levels of ammonium (i.e., under N-limited conditions), the DOM components were slightly oxidized, and fungal C metabolites with iron-reducing activity were secreted. Ammonium amendments decreased the amount of C metabolites, and no additional oxidation of the organic matter was detected. In contrast, the hydrolytic activity and the secretion of N-containing compounds increased, particularly when high levels of ammonium were added. Under these conditions, C, but not N, limited fungal growth. Although the overall production of mineral-associated organic C was not affected by ammonium concentrations, the observed shifts in the activities of the ex vivo and in vivo pathways affected the composition of organic matter adsorbed onto the mineral particles. Such changes will affect the properties of organic matter-mineral associations and, thus, ultimately, the stabilization of SOM. {\textcopyright} 2019 American Society for Microbiology.},

AM colonisation was positively correlated with phosphorus uptake by O. alata at low, but not at high phosphorus availability. Seedlings growth was positively related to arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation at both low and high phosphorus availability, suggesting that growth promotion by arbuscular mycorrhizas is not simply related to an increase of phosphorus uptake. In contrast, phosphorus uptake by T. moreliana was correlated with EM colonisation at both low and high phosphorus availability, but there was no relationship between growth and ectomycorrhizal colonisation. Promotion of phosphorus uptake by arbuscular mycorrhizas and ectomycorrhizas at low phosphorus availability is consistent with the co-occurrence of the two types of mycorrhiza in tropical rain forests where available soil phosphorus is low. However, ectomycorrhizal colonisation may also be of advantage where inputs of phosphorus rich litter raise the phosphorus status of the soil, as seen in the groves of ectomycorrhizal trees in Korup National Park, and may be one of the factors reinforcing local dominance by these trees.},

abstract = {Fungi play critical roles in ecosystem processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling, but have also been highlighted as significant contributors to organic matter build-up in boreal forest soils. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) mycelial biomass and necromass dynamics have recently been highlighted as essential for regulating build-up of soil organic matter. Understanding the extent to which shifts in mycelial community or growth trait composition cause changes in mycelial production and turnover over ecological gradients would aid a mechanistic understanding of these important processes at an ecosystem scale. Here, we test the hypotheses that shifting species and mycelial trait (exploration type) composition within the mycelial community underpin changes in biomass turnover with increasing forest age. We quantified mycelial turnover and assessed fungal community composition in a chronosequence of eight, 12- to 158-year-old, managed Pinus sylvestris forests. Turnover was estimated by determining mycelial biomass (ergosterol) in a sequence of ingrowth mesh bags and applying mathematical models. Fungal communities in the bags were identified using Pacific Biosciences sequencing of fungal ITS2 amplicons. To evaluate the accuracy of this method to represent all ECM fungi, community composition in bags was followed over time and compared with communities in soil. Mycelial communities changed with stand age, but we found no evidence that there were concurrent shifts in mycelial exploration types. Forest age and turnover were significantly correlated with ECM mycelial community composition and collectively explained 39.4% of total variation. The similarity between fungal communities in mesh bags and in soil was strongly forest age dependent, with communities in mesh bags diverging from soil communities in stands older than 60 years. However, in all stands, when bag incubation time exceeded 75 days, communities became more similar to soil communities. Synthesis. Our results support the idea that shifts in fungal community composition underpin the forest age-related decrease in mycelial turnover; however, since ingrowth mesh bags exclude some mycorrhizal species in older forests, it remains a possibility that turnover estimates were not reflecting the entire community. While we found no evidence that mycelial exploration types of fungi changed systematically with forest age, we suggest that other traits that relate to biomass turnover and necromass degradation require further study, as they may explain the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi regulate and contribute to soil organic matter accumulation. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors.

abstract = {Tree-killing forest disturbances such as storms and bark beetle outbreaks can lead to notable changes in the carbon (C) balance and functioning of forest ecosystems. In this study, the effects of a storm in 2010 followed by an outbreak of European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) on tree, litter and soil C stocks as well as humus layer C fractions and microbial community composition were examined in boreal Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) stands. Tree (aboveground), litter detritus (distinguishable twig, bark and cones) and soil (humus layer and 0–6 cm mineral soil) C stocks were quantified for undisturbed (living trees), storm disturbed (in 2010) and I. typographus disturbed (tree mortality in circa 2013–2014) plots in 2015–2016. Additional humus layer samples were collected in 2017 for determination of total microbial biomass C, ergosterol (fungal biomass indicator) and K2SO4 extractable (labile) C concentrations, as well as fungal and bacterial community composition (DNA sequencing). Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal mycelial growth in topsoil was also quantified. In spite of the differing initial development and intensity of the two disturbance types, there was little difference in humus layer C and microbiology between the storm and bark beetle disturbed plot types at the time of the study. This may be due to the longer time since the disturbance at the storm disturbed plots. The shift from tree biomass to necromass C stocks was not reflected in differences in SOC stocks or humus layer extractable C concentrations between undisturbed and disturbed plot types, but the amount of litter detritus on forest floor was similar (storm) or higher (beetle) in disturbed plots in comparison to undisturbed ones. Humus layer microbial biomass C and ergosterol concentrations and ECM fungal abundance were lower on disturbed plots in comparison to undisturbed plots.

Differences in the effects of the two disturbance types may occur when studied at differing spatial scales and at different times after disturbance.

abstract = {Gradient analysis is rarely used in studies of fungal communities. Data on macromycetes from eight sites along an elevation gradient in central Veracruz, Mexico, were used to demonstrate methods for gradient analysis that can be applied to studies of communities of fungi. Selected sites from 100 to 3,500 m altitude represent tropical dry forest, tropical montane cloud forest, conifer forest, and their ecotones. From May to October 2010, macromycetes were collected monthly within ten 10 × 10 m permanent plots per site. In total, 672 individuals of 213 species of macromycetes were recorded. Models for richness and diversity for all macromycete and ectomycorrhizal communities displayed peaks in the mid-part of the gradient, and a tendency to increase with elevation, whereas xylophagous fungi displayed a peak in the mid-lower part but tended to decrease with elevation. Cluster and Maximum Likelihood analyses distinguished four communities for both macromycetes and trees, but plant and fungal communities were only partly concordant. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that macromycete distribution along the gradient is related to slope, relative humidity, soil temperature, soil water content, canopy openness, and litter depth. Spearman's correlation and regression trees suggested that air and soil temperature, relative humidity, soil water content, canopy openness, vegetation structure and tree species richness were most strongly related to macrofungal functional groups, but these environmental variables were often correlated to the forest type and may not be causal. Variation in the environment along the elevation gradient differentially affected macromycete functional groups. Results from the different methods used in this work were concordant and showed significant patterns. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. (outside the USA).},

abstract = {On a global basis, peatlands are a major reserve of carbon (C). Hydrological changes can affect the decomposition processes in peatlands and in turn can alter their C balance. Since 1959, a groundwater extraction plant has generated a water-level gradient at our study site that has gradually changed part of the wet fen into a dry peatland forest. The average water-level drawdown of the gradient (from a pristine 9 cm to 26 cm in the dry end) is close to an estimate predicted by an increase in mean global temperature of 3°C. We studied the total microbial community of the aerobic surface peat in four locations along the gradient through phospholipid fatty acid and PCR-DGGE methods. Additionally, field measurements of soil respiration showed a threefold increase in the C-emission rate at the driest location compared with the wettest one, indicating enhanced decomposition. Also, both fungal and bacterial biomass increased in the drier locations. At the species level, the fungal community changed due to water-level drawdown whereas actinobacteria were less sensitive to drying. The majority of fungal sequences were similar to ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which dominated throughout the gradient. Our results indicate that ECM fungi might act as important facultative decomposers in organic-rich environments such as peatlands. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {Tropical forests play a dominant role in the global carbon (C) cycle, and models predict increases in tropical net primary productivity (NPP) and C storage in response to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The extent to which increasing CO2 will enhance NPP depends in part on the availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to support growth. Some tropical trees can potentially overcome nutrient limitation by acquiring N via symbiotic dinitrogen (N2) fixation, which may provide a benefit in acquiring P via investment in N-rich phosphatase enzymes or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We conducted a seedling experiment to investigate the effects of elevated CO2 and soil nutrient availability on the growth of two N2-fixing and two non-N2-fixing tropical tree species. We hypothesized that under elevated CO2 and at low nutrient availability (i.e., low N and P), N2 fixers would have higher growth rates than non-N2 fixers because N2 fixers have a greater capacity to acquire both N and P. We also hypothesized that differences in growth rates between N2 fixers and non-N2 fixers would decline as nutrient availability increases because N2 fixers no longer have an advantage in nutrient acquisition. We found that the N2 fixers had higher growth rates than the non-N2 fixers under elevated CO2 and at low nutrient availability, and that the difference in growth rates between the N2 and non-N2 fixers declined as nutrient availability increased, irrespective of CO2. Overall, N2 fixation, root phosphatase activity, and AM colonization decreased with increasing nutrient availability, and increased under elevated CO2 at low nutrient availability. Further, AM colonization was positively related to the growth of the non-N2 fixers, whereas both N2 fixation and root phosphatase activity were positively related to the growth of the N2 fixers. Though our results indicate all four tree species have the capacity to up- or down-regulate nutrient acquisition to meet their stoichiometric demands, the greater capacity for the N2 fixers to acquire both N and P may enable them to overcome nutritional constraints to NPP under elevated CO2, with implications for the response of tropical forests to future environmental change. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the Ecological Society of America},

In this study, we compared the decomposition of dead fungal biomass (a.k.a. necromass) of two species, Mortierella elongata and Meliniomyces bicolor, in paired wood and soil plots in a boreal forest in northern Minnesota, USA. Mass loss was quantified at four time points over an 8-week incubation and the richness and composition of the fungal communities colonizing fungal necromass were characterized using high-throughput sequencing. We found that the structure of fungal decomposer communities in wood and soil differed, but, in both habitats, there was relatively rapid decay (∼30% remaining after 56 days). Mass loss was significantly faster in soil and for high-quality (i.e. high nitrogen and low melanin) fungal necromass. In both habitats, there was a clear trajectory of early colonization by opportunistic fungal taxa followed by colonization of fungi with greater enzymatic capacities to degrade more recalcitrant compounds, including white-rot and ectomycorrhizal fungi. Collectively, our results indicate that patterns emerging regarding substrate quality effects on fungal necromass decomposition in soil and leaf litter can be largely extended to fungal necromass decomposition in wood. {\textcopyright} 2020 FEMS.},

abstract = {Aim: The fine roots of trees may show plastic responses to their resource environment. Several, contrasting hypotheses exist on this plasticity, but empirical evidence for these hypotheses is scattered. This study aims to enhance our understanding of tree root plasticity by examining intra-specific variation in fine-root mass and morphology, fine-root growth and decomposition, and associated mycorrhizal interactions in beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests on soils that differ in resource availability. Methods: We measured the mass and morphological traits of fine roots (i.e. ≤ 2 mm diameter) sampled to 50 cm depth. Fine-root growth was measured with ingrowth cores, and fine-root decomposition with litter bags. Mycorrhizal fungal biomass was determined using ingrowth mesh bags. Results: Both tree species showed more than three times higher fine-root mass, and a ten-fold higher fine-root growth rate on sand than on clay, but no or marginal differences in overall fine-root morphology. Within the fine-root category however, beech stands had relatively more root length of their finest roots on clay than on sand. In the spruce stands, ectomycorrhizal mycelium biomass was larger on sand than on clay. Conclusions: In temperate beech and spruce forests, fine-root mass and mycorrhizal fungal biomass, rather than fine-root morphology, are changed to ensure uptake under different soil resource conditions. Yet enhancing our mechanistic understanding of fine-root trait plasticity and how it affects tree growth requires more attention to fine-root dynamics, the functional diversity within the fine-roots, and mycorrhizal symbiosis as an important belowground uptake strategy. {\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Fine root litter is the principal source of carbon stored in forest soils and a dominant source of carbon for fungal decomposers. Differences in decomposer capacity between fungal species may be important determinants of fine-root decomposition rates. Variable-retention harvesting (VRH) provides refuge for ectomycorrhizal fungi, but its influence on fine-root decomposers is unknown, as are the effects of functional shifts in these fungal communities on carbon cycling. We compared fungal communities decomposing fine roots (in litter bags) under VRH, clearcut, and uncut stands at two sites (6 and 13 years postharvest) and two decay stages (43 days and 1 year after burial) in Douglas fir forests in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Fungal species and guilds were identified from decomposed fine roots using high-throughput sequencing. Variable retention had short-term effects on $\beta$-diversity; harvest treatment modified the fungal community composition at the 6-year-postharvest site, but not at the 13-year-postharvest site. Ericoid and ectomycorrhizal guilds were not more abundant under VRH, but stand age significantly structured species composition. Guild composition varied by decay stage, with ruderal species later replaced by saprotrophs and ectomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizal abundance on decomposing fine roots may partially explain why fine roots typically decompose more slowly than surface litter. Our results indicate that stand age structures fine-root decomposers but that decay stage is more important in structuring the fungal community than shifts caused by harvesting. The rapid postharvest recovery of fungal communities decomposing fine roots suggests resiliency within this community, at least in these young regenerating stands in coastal British Columbia. {\textcopyright} 2018 American Society for Microbiology.},

Forest topsoil and river sand were mixed at a volumetric ratio of 1 : 1 as bedding medium.

These seedlings were raised for 6 months at a nursery of the Lambir Hills National Park, Miri, Sarawak, Malaysia. Mycorrhizal formation percentage, dry matter weight, and nutrient content of the seedlings and soil properties of the bedding media were measured. The ectomycorrhizal infection could transfer from mycorrhizal tree to the seedlings by the elongation and connection of rhizomorph in both 20-cm- and 30-cminterval treatments. The ectomycorrhizal inoculation would be better when the seedlings were planted closer to mycorrhizal tree, i.e., at 20-cm interval.

abstract = {Forest biogeochemical cycling is strongly influenced by the turnover of ectomycorrhizal fungal tissues. Fungal tissues may decompose differently from plant tissues due to their unique chemistry and may be important to understanding ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycles. Melanin is a recalcitrant, complex cell wall polymer commonly found in fungi. Melanin concentration varies significantly among species, which may contribute to the wide variation in their rates of decomposition previously observed. In a comparative experiment we examined decomposition of ectomycorrhizal fungi of varying melanin concentrations. In an additional experiment we examined the effect of melanin biosynthesis inhibition on decomposition of the highly melanized ectomycorrhizal fungus Cenococcum geophilum. Among species, initial melanin concentration was negatively correlated with decomposition while initial nitrogen concentration was positively correlated with decomposition. When melanin synthesis was inhibited, tissues of C.geophilum decomposed significantly faster. We conclude that melanin and nitrogen concentrations may control decomposition of ectomycorrhizal fungi as do lignin and nitrogen concentrations in plant material, and thus may have significant consequences for terrestrial carbon and nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The production and mortality of extramatrical mycelia (EMM) of ectomycorrhizal fungi are poorly quantified despite their importance in soil carbon cycling in forests. Ingrowth bag/core methods are the most widely used but can not accurately assess temporal changes in EMM production and mortality, resulting in great uncertainty in annual estimates. A modified method using two mathematical models (Biomarker and Algebraic models) is proposed to quantify EMM production, mortality and decomposition over differing time periods by integrating EMM decomposition dynamics with ingrowth core/bag data. In the Biomarker model, EMM biomass and EMM total mass (sum of necromass and biomass) are assumed to be known by using chemical biomarkers as proxies. In the Algebraic model, only the total mass is known and the biomass is calculated using an algebraic method. Model application in a loblolly pine plantation showed that mean monthly EMM production, mortality and decomposition estimates among three time periods ranged from 10.1 to 16.0 kg ha−1, 6.6–15.0 kg ha−1, and 1.4–6.1 kg ha−1, respectively, when using the Biomarker model, while these estimates ranged from 24.8 to 35.7 kg ha−1, 15.5–22.8 kg ha−1, and 5.7–9.8 kg ha−1, respectively, when using the Algebraic model, demonstrating the importance of assessing temporal changes. Model validation indicated that EMM estimates were more reliable for short-term compared to long-term incubation (184 vs. 322 days). Our method could improve EMM estimation by accurately assessing temporal changes in EMM production, mortality and decomposition in forests. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in removing greater amounts of non-timber residues from forests for use in energy production. As part of a study aimed at elucidating the ecological impacts of these practices in Finland, piles of thinning residues of contrasting mass per unit area were established in 2004 around the base of individual Scots pine trees. As part of an NSF funded undergraduate training program, we have sampled the soil under these residue piles to evaluate the effect of leaving different amounts of residue on site to supply nutrients for remaining trees. Aboveground tree biomass production was significantly higher with higher levels of post-harvest residue retention. However, changes in soil chemistry were minimal and inconsistent with increasing residue amounts. Fine (<1. mm) tree root biomass showed little response to residue levels, but specific root length (length per unit mass) and ectomycorrhizal root tip abundance showed significant increases in the highest residue addition compared to the no-addition control. This may suggest a greater root searching strategy under high residue levels. There was no evidence of residue effect on soil nematodes but a consistent increase in abundance of 0-2. mm length enchytraeids with increased residue. This may be a result of higher rates of asexual reproduction under residues. Soil arthropod abundances did not correlate with residue levels. Even in this cold boreal forest ecosystem, it is possible that sampling 5. years after residue placement we may have missed some of the early influence of decomposition of more labile fractions of the residues on soil organisms and processes. It is likely that the current phase of woody material decomposition will have lesser effects on soil biology. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

These comparisons need to consider not only how symbiotic associations modify plant uptake of nutrients but the interactions between mycorrhizas and decomposer microbes and fauna, and how these interactions influence the conservation of, or competition for, available nutrients. The authors identify four areas of future study that should be accorded priority: (1) the cost-benefit ratio (to the host) of maintaining mycorrhizal fungi on roots and the optimal mycorrhizal biomass that can be supported before the cost-benefit ratio becomes unfavorable; (2) the significance of mycorrhizas in storing nutrients in ecosystems; (3) the significance of interconnecting (naturally grafted) roots relative to the links between different roots attributable to mycorrhizal hyphae; (4) the ability of mycorrhizal fungi to use complex organic substrates as sources of nutrients (such as N and P) in forests. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Litter species richness influences fungal diversity because of resource heterogeneity. Litter species composition effects on decomposition have been studied mostly in aboveground litter. However, little is known about the effects of litter diversity of roots and litter type effect on fungal diversity in general. We addressed litter species composition and richness effects on diversity of ectomycorrhizal (EcM), saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi in decomposing foliar and root litter in the Satakunta forest diversity experiment by varying litter species richness from one to four species in 560 litter bags incubated under tree canopies. After one year of decomposition, there were no significant non-additive effects of litter mixtures on mass loss. Litter species composition was the strongest predictor for saprotroph and plant pathogen community structure in foliar litter, but its effect on root litter fungal composition was much weaker. Litter diversity strongly enhanced fungal richness in foliar but not in root substrate. We found no evidence for host litter preferences in host-specific EcM fungi. Our study suggests that litter species richness and especially certain litter species may influence decomposition through modifying fungal community composition both in foliar and root litter.},

abstract = {Aims: We investigated the influence of tree species on the natural 15N abundance in forest stands under elevated ambient N deposition. Methods: We analysed $\delta$15N in litter, the forest floor and three mineral soil horizons along with ecosystem N status variables at six sites planted three decades ago with five European broadleaved tree species and Norway spruce. Results: Litter $\delta$15N and 15N enrichment factor ($\delta$15Nlitter-$\delta$15Nsoil) were positively correlated with N status based on soil and litter N pools, nitrification, subsoil nitrate concentration and forest growth. Tree species differences were also significant for these N variables and for the litter $\delta$15N and enrichment factor. Litter from ash and sycamore maple with high N status and low fungal mycelia activity was enriched in 15N (+0.9 delta units) relative to other tree species (European beech, pedunculate oak, lime and Norway spruce) even though the latter species leached more nitrate. Conclusions: The $\delta$15N pattern reflected tree species related traits affecting the N cycling as well as site fertility and former land use, and possibly differences in N leaching. The tree species $\delta$15N patterns reflected fractionation caused by uptake of N through mycorrhiza rather than due to nitrate leaching or other N transformation processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Communities of litter saprotrophic and root-associated fungi are vertically separated within boreal forest soil profiles. It is unclear whether this depth partitioning is maintained exclusively by substrate-mediated niche partitioning (i.e. distinct fundamental niches), or by competition for space and resources (i.e. distinct realized niches). Improved understanding of the mechanisms driving spatial partitioning of these fungal guilds is critical, as they modulate carbon and nutrient cycling in different ways. Under field settings, we tested the effects of substrate quality and the local fungal species pool at various depths in determining the potential of saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi to colonize and exploit organic matter. Natural substrates of three qualities – fresh or partly decomposed litter or humus – were incubated in the corresponding organic layers of a boreal forest soil profile in a fully factorial design. After one and two growing seasons, fungal community composition in the substrates was determined by 454-pyrosequencing and decomposition was analyzed. Fungal community development during the course of the experiment was determined to similar degrees by vertical location of the substrates (24% of explained variation) and by substrate quality (20%), indicating that interference competition is a strong additional driver of the substrate-dependent depth partitioning of fungal guilds in the system. During the first growing season, litter substrates decomposed slower when colonized by root-associated communities than when colonized by communities of litter saprotrophs, whereas humus was only slightly decomposed by both fungal guilds. During the second season, certain basidiomycetes from both guilds were particularly efficient in localizing and exploiting their native organic substrates although displaced in the vertical profile. This validates that fungal community composition, rather than microclimatic factors, were responsible for observed depth-related differences in decomposer activities during the first season. In conclusion, our results suggest that saprotrophic and root-associated fungal guilds have overlapping fundamental niches with respect to colonization of substrates of different qualities, and that their substrate-dependent depth partitioning in soils of ectomycorrhiza-dominated ecosystems is reinforced by interference competition. Through competitive interactions, mycorrhizal fungi can thus indirectly regulate litter decomposition rates by restraining activities of more efficient litter saprotrophs.

abstract = {Mycorrhiza is the most ancient and widespread mutualistic symbiotic association between plants and soil borne fungi. Mycorrhizae sensu lato are dual organs of absortion formed by mutualistic symbiotic fungi inhabiting healthy absorbing organs such as roots, rhizomes or thalli of most terrestrial plants and also many aquatics and epiphytes. In nature the soil nutrient acquisition of plants occurs to great extent via these mycorrhizal organs. It is now widely accepted that mycorrhizae would have played a fundamental role in the colonization of the land by plants functioning as nutrient absorbing structures even before the appearance of roots. Mycorrhizae are traditionally classified into categories on the basis of their fungal partners and macro-and microscopical anatomical structures of the dual organs. Among them ectomycorrhiza (ECM) is typically formed between the fine roots of trees of boreal and temperate forest and fungal species usually belonging to Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. In this chapter we discuss the evolutionary origin of ECM, some of its morphological and anatomical characters, the ecological significance of ECM and some of the molecular traits related to establishment and functioning of ECM structures between fungi and their plant hosts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Phytophthora cinnamomi in Australian forests is taken as an example of a root pathogen that can have substantial effects on the species composition of native vegetation. In recent decades it has caused conspicuous death of Eucalyptus and other species in forest in W and SE Australia. In Victoria marked changes in the species composition of open Eucalyptus woodland caused by P. cinnamomi epidemic have been documented over 20 yr, and there are signs that an equilibrium between fungus and vegetation may be developing in some areas. A pot experiment showed VA-mycorrhiza having little effect on the growth of Lolium perenne and Plantago lanceolata when they were separate, but greatly increasing the ability of P; lanceolata to continue growth when in the presence of L. perenne. When leaves of dicotyledonous tree species are compared, ectomycorrhizal species usually have a higher N:P ratio than VA-mycorrhizal species. This could be because of greater ability by ectomycorrhizal species to obtain N from proteins in litter. The leaf litter of ectomycorrhizal trees usually decomposes more slowly than that of VA-mycorrhizal trees. These differences may have important implications when species of the two types grow together. -from Author},

abstract = {The CENTURY model of soil organic matter turn-over developed by Parton
and co-workers has been used successfully for grasslands to predict
dynamics of C, N and other nutrients. It was tested here for
decomposition of a range of forest litters and for N mineralisation in
forest soils. Modifications to the CENTURY model were necessary to match
model output to empirical findings. These modifications included: (1)
incorporation of additional woody litter pools (i.e. fine-wood and
coarse-wood) (2) allowing the N content of soil organic matter (SOM)
pools to vary (3) constraining N mineralisation and immobilisation to
the active SOM pool (4) incorporation of a small flux of mineral N to
the resistant SOM pool (5) allowance of mycorrhizal uptake of N, and (6)
re-formulation of temperature and moisture effects on decomposition.
Other possible changes, such as giving greater flexibility to the
critical N concentration for mineralisation, were tested but found not
to improve model performance.
The modified model largely accounted for the effects of initial lignin
and N concentration on subsequent litter decomposition rate, litter N
concentrations and critical N concentrations for the commencement of
mineralisation. Consequently, the model could successfully simulate
realistic time courses of N immobilisation and subsequent mineralisation
for a range of litter types. The present model also successfully
predicted the critical N concentration for N mineralisation across a
wide range of litter samples from forests and other vegetation sources.
Net mineralisation was successfully simulated in forest soils, which
were either untreated, irrigated or fertilised. (C) 2002 Elsevier

abstract = {Plants have numerous impacts on biogeochemical cycling across both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. These effects extend well beyond the critical role of carbon (C) fixation through photosynthesis that provides the basis for ecosystem energy flow. While foliar and root traits of senescent plant material (litter) have been explored in detail in terrestrial ecosystems, there is a resurgence of interest in how plants modulate biogeochemical cycling in ways other than litter quality effects on C and nutrient mineralization. This Special Feature represents a collection of 'fresh' perspectives on how plants alone, or in interaction with other organisms, have important and lasting impacts on biogeochemical cycles of C and nutrients in a range of terrestrial and aquatic environments. We begin in the open ocean and then peer from the forest edge before moving into forest understoreys and grasslands to examine the control by live terrestrial plants on ecosystem C and nutrient cycling. Plants directly affect biogeochemical cycling while living through their diversity and composition, nutrient capture and strategies for assimilating C, and by altering the microclimate for decomposition. In addition, how they construct their tissues and alter the abiotic environment has large impacts on the turnover of C and nutrients once plants have senesced or died. From the direct impact of plants, we move onto the influence of plant-insect interactions, which effectively determine changes in plant stoichiometry in grasslands of varying diversity. Finally, looking directly in the soil, it is clear that plant-mycorrhizae interactions are important in modulating the response of litter decomposition to nutrient addition and the nature of C metabolism in the soil. Synthesis. The papers here highlight careful matching between how plants live and their biotic and abiotic contexts. Taken together, it appears that the dynamic, rather than passive, nature of plant responses to variable environments is key in affecting ecosystem level processes of C and nutrient turnover. This Special Feature highlights a diversity of connections between plants and their environment and demonstrates that in both life and death, how plants respond to these changes differs among plant lineages and this diversity will play a central role in determining biogeochemical cycling in the future in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.},

We hypothesized that the patterns of stable isotopes ($\delta$13C and $\delta$15N) in the sporocarps would match those of saprotrophic fungi and that radiocarbon ($\Delta$14C) analyses would indicate that Morchella was assimilating old carbon not current-year photosynthate. We compared radiocarbon and stable isotopes in Morchella with values from concurrently collected foliage, the ectomycorrhizal Geopyxis carbonaria (Alb. & Schwein.) Sacc., the saprotrophic Plicaria endocarpoides (Berk.) Rifai, and with literature to determine isotopic values for ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic fungi. Geopyxis, Plicaria and Morchella, respectively, were 3%, 5%and 6% higher in 13C than foliage and 5%, 7% and 7% higher in 15N. High 15N enrichment in Morchella indicated that recent litter was not the primary source for Morchella nitrogen, and similar 13C and 15N enrichments to Plicaria suggest that Morchella assimilates its carbon and nitrogen from the same source pool as this saprotrophic fungus. From radiocarbon analyses Morchella averaged 11 ± 6 y old (n = 19), Plicaria averaged 17 ± 5 y old (n = 3), foliage averaged 1 ± 2 y old (n = 8) and Geopyxis (n = 1) resembled foliage in $\Delta$14C. We conclude that morels fruiting in post-fire environments in our study assimilated old carbon and were saprotrophic. {\textcopyright} 2016 by The Mycological Society of America.},

The list has been compiled from data associated with specimens held in Herbarium PDD and in Herbarium NZFRI(M), and from the literature. Nothofagus forests are an important conservation resource, and a vast storehouse for New Zealand fungi; approximately 35% of the known New Zealand agaric mycota are associated with Nothofagus, and 50% of the known polypore species. Of the 226 named species of ectomycorrhizal fungi found in New Zealand beech forests (205 agarics, 19 Aphyllophorales — clavarioid, hydnoid, etc., 1 as-comycete, 1 mitosporic fungus), about 90% are native, with most of these being endemic. Six mycorrhizal agaric genera are especially well represented: Amanita (11 species), Cortinarius (57 speties), Democybe (11 species), Inocybe (13 species), Russula (23 species), and Thaxterogaster (13 species). Few pathogens have been recorded. The most conspicuous of these are three Cyttaria spp. (beech strawberries) found only on N. menziesii. Two mitosporic fungi, Nodulisporium sp. and Sporothrix sp., in association with various insects, may be partially responsible for beech forest decline. Sooty mould fungi, growing on honeydew secreted by scale insects, produce conspicuous black growth on beech trees. Such growth can be caused by representatives of 10 genera of ascomycetes and mitosporic fungi, many of which also grow on other host plants. Large numbers of saprobic fungi are recorded on beech wood or twigs and leaf litter, and some of these cause economically significant wood rots and sapstain. {\textcopyright} 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Here, we collected a database of 26 variables related to belowground C and N cycling from 207 studies covering 209 sampling sites in China, to better understand the variations in belowground C and N cycling between the two mycorrhizal types in forest ecosystems along a climatic gradient. The AM forests had significantly lower soil total C and N contents, and soil microbial biomass C and N, than ECM forests, probably due to differences in litter quality (N and C/N) between AM and ECM forest types. In contrast, AM forests had significantly higher litter input, litter decomposition and soil respiration than ECM forests. Temperature and precipitation had significant positive effects on litter input and decomposition, soil total C and N contents, and soil respiration in AM and ECM forests. Overall, our results indicated that mycorrhizal type strongly affected belowground C and N cycle processes in forest ecosystems.

In tropical montane wet forests, warmer MAT drives higher N bioavailability, while patterns of P availability are inconsistent across MAT. Two important nutrient acquisition strategies, fine root proliferation into bulk soil and root association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, are dependent on C availability to the plant via primary production. The case study presented here tests whether variation in bulk soil N bioavailability across a tropical montane wet forest elevation gradient (5.2°C MAT range) influences (a) morphology fine root proliferation into soil patches with elevated N, P, and N+P relative to background soil and (b) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonization of fine roots in patches. We created a fully factorial fertilized root ingrowth core design (N, P, N+P, unfertilized control) representing soil patches with elevated N and P bioavailability relative to background bulk soil. Our results show that percent AMF colonization of roots increased with MAT (r2 =.19, p =.004), but did not respond to fertilization treatments. Fine root length (FRL), a proxy for root foraging, increased with MAT in N+P-fertilized patches only (p =.02), while other fine root morphological parameters did not respond to the gradient or fertilized patches. We conclude that in N-rich, fine root elongation into areas with elevated N and P declines while AMF abundance increases with MAT. These results indicate a tradeoff between P acquisition strategies occurring with changing N bioavailability, which may be influenced by higher C availability with warmer MAT. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

abstract = {Mycorrhizae are important in the functioning of forest ecosystems worldwide, and play a critical role in water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and prevention of feeder root disease. The majority of mycorrhizal research has been conducted on upland sites, especially in coniferous ecosystems and in commercial agricultural production. However, the maintenance and restoration of bottomland hardwood (BLH) forest ecosystems in the southern United States is of increasing concern. Both ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae are present in BLH forests, although the dominance of one or the other type depends primarily on both the tree species and the hydrologie regime. Ectomycorrhizae tend to be more sensitive to flooding, while endomycorrhizal infection can be present even in permanently flooded soils. The mycorrhizae of sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and the oaks (Quercus spp.) have been studied most due to their economic importance. Considerable work is still needed to better understand mycorrhizal relationships in BLH ecosystems and associated trees, both with respect to infectivity and nutrient cycling. Such information may be necessary for restoration of BLH forests on old agricultural fields, or to maintain the productivity of BLH forests after harvest. This paper summarizes studies on mycorrhizae relationships in BLH forests and suggests future work necessary for understanding the role mycorrhizae can have in managing these ecosystems.

abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are an important component of the Pinus patula Schlechdt. et Cham. forest ecosystem in Mpumalanga, South Africa. ECM roots are intimately associated with accumulated litter on the forest floor and four ECM isolates where examined to determine whether they provide plant access to inorganic and organic sources of nitrogen (N) and inorganic, complexed inorganic and organic sources of phosphorus (P). In in vitro studies, all isolates were found to utilize most of the organic N compounds and organic or complexed inorganic P compounds supplied. Thus, ECM fungi could play a significant role in providing N and P to P. patula, especially from sources to which the host plant would not normally have access. Temperature sensitivities and pH optima of the four isolates differed. Of the ECM isolates WITS 01 and WITS 06 were collected from a high-litter site: WITS 01 mycorrhizas, identified as Scleroderma citrinum, were white, smooth and dichotomously branched with smooth, pale yellow, differentiated rhizomorphs. The mantle was plectenchymatous with outer and inner layers showing ring-like arrangements of hyphal bundles. The Hartig net had a palmetti shape. The WITS 02 (not identified) mycorrhizas were brown with lighter coloured root tips, with simple to dichotomous branching, smooth with no distinct mantle and sparse hyphae occurred on the root surface. The Hartig net was palmetti type with lobed haustoria. The results are discussed in relation to ECM distribution and function in nutrient cycling.},

abstract = {Abstract: The results of monitoring the biota of agaricoid basidiomycetes in spruce forests (riverbank spruce and wood sorrel spruce forest) in the subzone of the southern taiga of Perm krai for 40 years are summed up. To date, 336 species and intraspecific taxa of agaricoid basidiomycetes belonging to 73 genera and 16 families have been found in spruce forests. The species of the families Tricholomataceae, Cortinariaceae, and Russulaceae predominate, which is typical for the boreal zone of Eurasia. The largest number of species is found in the genera Cortinarius (43 species), Mycena (39), Russula (25), and Lactarius (13), which is typical of the southern taiga subzone. It is noted that the species composition of agaricoid basidiomycetes changes with time to a greater extent (Jacquard's coefficients (J × 100): riverbank spruce forest: J = 44–50; sorrel spruce forest: J = 43–47) than the species composition of higher vascular plants (J = 69–88). Many common features are revealed between the species composition of fungi of spruce forests (J = 49). Over the entire period of observations in spruce forests, 16 species dominating in the number of basidiomas and 19–21 species dominating in the biomass of basidiomas have been identified. As a result of the analysis of the ecological–trophic structure of the studied biogeocenoses, mycorrhiza-forming agents predominate (37.4–43.5%). The relationship between the diversity and productivity of agaricoid fungi with the main climatic indicators (May–September) is studied. It is found that an increase in the average monthly air temperature in August leads to a decrease in the number of xylotroph basidiomas in the sorrel spruce forest (rs = –0.7) and the basidiom litter saprotrophs biomass in the riverbank spruce forest (rs = –0.7). Heavy rainfall in August contributes to a reduction in the number of basidiomas of litter saprotrophs in the riverbank fir forest (rs = –0.7). {\textcopyright} 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract = {Temperature and substrate availability constrain the activity of the extracellular enzymes that decompose and release nutrients from soil organic matter (SOM). Proteolytic enzymes are the primary class of enzymes involved in the depolymerization of nitrogen (N) from proteinaceous components of SOM, and their activity affects the rate of N cycling in forest soils. The objectives of this study were to determine whether and how temperature and substrate availability affect the activity of proteolytic enzymes in temperate forest soils, and whether the activity of proteolytic enzymes and other enzymes involved in the acquisition of N (i.e., chitinolytic and ligninolytic enzymes) differs between trees species that form associations with either ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Temperature limitation of proteolytic enzyme activity was observed only early in the growing season when soil temperatures in the field were near 4°C. Substrate limitation to proteolytic activity persisted well into the growing season. Ligninolytic enzyme activity was higher in soils dominated by ectomycorrhizal associated tree species. In contrast, the activity of proteolytic and chitinolytic enzymes did not differ, but there were differences between mycorrhizal association in the control of roots on enzyme activity. Roots of ectomycorrhizal species but not those of arbuscular mycorrhizal species exerted significant control over proteolytic, chitinolytic, and ligninolytic enzyme activity; the absence of ectomycorrhizal fine roots reduced the activity of all three enzymes. These results suggest that climate warming in the absence of increases in substrate availability may have a modest effect on soil-N cycling, and that global changes that alter belowground carbon allocation by trees are likely to have a larger effect on nitrogen cycling in stands dominated by ectomycorrhizal fungi. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Wood-inhabiting fungi (WIF) are pivotal to wood decomposition, which in turn strongly influences nutrient dynamics in forest soils. However, their dispersal mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that the majority of WIF are soil-borne. For this reason, the presented research aimed to quantify the contribution of soil as a source and medium for the dispersal of WIF to deadwood using high-throughput sequencing. We tested effects of tree species (specifically Schima superba and Pinus massoniana) on the percentage of WIF shared between soil and deadwood in a Chinese subtropical forest ecosystem. We also assessed the taxonomic and ecological functional group affiliations of the fungal community shared between soil and deadwood. Our results indicate that soil is a major route for WIF colonization as 12%–15% (depending on the tree species) of soil fungi were simultaneously detected in deadwood. We also demonstrate that tree species (p < 0.01) significantly shapes the composition of the shared soil and deadwood fungal community. The pH of decomposing wood was shown to significantly correspond (p < 0.01) with the shared community of wood-inhabiting (of both studied tree species) and soil fungi. Furthermore, our data suggest that a wide range of fungal taxonomic (Rozellida, Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota) and ecological functional groups (saprotrophs, ectomycorrhizal, mycoparasites, and plant pathogens) may use soil as a source and medium for transport to deadwood in subtropical forest ecosystem. While 12%–62% of saprotrophic, ectomycorrhizal, and mycoparasitic WIF may utilize soil to colonize deadwood, only 5% of the detected plant pathogens were detected in both soil and deadwood, implying that these fungi use other dispersal routes. Animal endosymbionts and lichenized WIF were not detected in the soil samples. Future studies should consider assessing the relative contributions of other possible dispersal mechanisms (e.g. wind, water splash, water dispersal, animal dispersal, and mycelial network) in the colonization of deadwood by soil fungi. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

abstract = {This review critically examines the role of boron (B) in forests in view of recent findings on B nutrition and the continuing occurrence of B deficiency. Many perceptions about the role of B in plants and its uptake and mobility have been altered since the last review on B in forest trees in 1990. Now there is evidence for a fundamental role of B in the formation of the pectic structure in primary cell walls in plants, and further roles in membrane function are being explored. In plants, channel-mediated B uptake, active B uptake and B uptake by mycorrhizas have been shown, B transporters have been identified, and B retranslocation has been shown. We explore these findings and their consequences on forest trees and on ecosystems that they dominate. Particular emphasis is placed on B retranslocation and B in mycorrhizal symbiosis, given their importance in trees.Following from impaired development of the primary cell wall in B-deficient trees, disorders in the structural development of organs and whole plants are manifested. This has consequences for tree form, affecting wood quality and productivity. At a stand level, at least part of the value of wood production is lost by the time the deficiency symptoms appear. As symptoms identifying deficiency in many tree species are too easily confused with many other effects, greater use should be made of foliar analysis but this requires establishing robust prognostic values for the trees of interest. There is still no explanation as to why root tip and mycorrhiza development are among the first phenomena to be affected as the B supply decreases. Whether B is required by, or whether it is useful for fungi, is still an open question.Boron remobilisation within trees may be a key factor in the occurrence of forests in areas with very low B availability, as most of the B in the whole stand can be in the standing biomass. The ability to remobilise B varies considerably between species, but we suggest that there is a continuum rather than a strict division to B-retranslocating and non-retranslocating species. Boron output from forest ecosystems with potential for leaching is controlled by adsorption in the soil, which is still poorly understood particularly in soils with abundant organic matter. Increased concentrations of phenolic compounds in B-deficient plants and possibly altered lignin concentration can affect plant defence systems to herbivory and pathogens, and nutrient and carbon release through decomposition. Hence, B nutrition and fertilisation of low-B stands can have implications both to the resistance of trees to biotic stress, as well as influence the cycles of other nutrients and carbon in forests. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Exclusion tubes were used to reduce and selectively test for belowground competition by V. myrtillus. Shoots of V. myrtillus were folded back to reduce aboveground competition. Reduced belowground competition by V. myrtillus increased P. abies current-year shoot length, shoot and root biomass, seedling nutrient concentration, and mycorrhizal colonization. Reduced aboveground competition affected P. abies seedling root biomass positively whereas seedling survival, shoot length, and shoot/root ratio were negatively affected. Addition of activated carbon to the soil surface to reduce the effect of possible phytotoxic leachates from V. myrtillus leaves and litter had no effects on P. abies seedling survival and growth. No significant interactions among treatments were found. We conclude that suppressed growth of P. abies seedlings in V. myrtillus sites of northern boreal forests is caused mainly by belowground resource competition.},

abstract = {Introduction The mycelium of woodland fungi can act both as a reservoir and as a distribution system for nutrients, owing to its physiological and developmental adaptations to life at the interface between organic and mineral soil horizons. The mobility of accumulated nitrogen and phosphorus within the mycelial networks of cord-forming wood decay fungi and ectomycorrhiza enables fungi to play key roles as wood decomposers and root symbionts. The dynamics of nitrogen movement have been less investigated than phosphorus owing to lack of a suitable tracer. We have developed a new technique for tracing nitrogen translocation in real time, using 14C as a marker for nitrogen by incorporating it into a nondecomposed amino acid that tracks the mycelial free amino acid pool. Its movement can be imaged by counting photon emissions from a scintillant screen in contact with the mycelial system. This method allows real-time imaging at high temporal and spatial resolution, for periods of weeks and areas up to 1m2, in microcosms that mimic the mineral/organic soil interface of the forest floor. The results reveal a hitherto unsuspected dynamism and responsiveness in amino acid flows through mycelial networks of cord-forming, wood-decomposing basidiomycetes. We interpret these in the light of current understanding of the pivotal role of fungi in boreal and temperate forest floor nutrient cycling, and attempt to formulate key questions to investigate the effects of mycelial nitrogen translocation on forest floor decomposition and nitrogen absorption. {\textcopyright} British Mycological Society 2006.},

abstract = {Rising atmospheric [CO2] has the potential to alter soil carbon (C) cycling by increasing the content of recalcitrant constituents in plant litter, thereby decreasing rates of decomposition. Because fine root turnover constitutes a large fraction of annual NPP, changes in fine root decomposition are especially important. These responses will likely be affected by soil resource availability and the life history characteristics of the dominant tree species. We evaluated the effects of elevated atmospheric [CO2] and soil resource availability on the production and chemistry, mycorrhizal colonization, and decomposition of fine roots in an early- and late-successional tree species that are economically and ecologically important in north temperate forests. Open-top chambers were used to expose young trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) trees to ambient (36 Pa) and elevated (56 Pa) atmospheric CO2. Soil resource availability was composed of two treatments that bracketed the range found in the Upper Lake States, USA. After 2.5 years of growth, sugar maple had greater fine root standing crop due to relatively greater allocation to fine roots (30% of total root biomass) relative to aspen (7% total root biomass). Relative to the low soil resources treatment, aspen fine root biomass increased 76% with increased soil resource availability, but only under elevated [CO2]. Sugar maple fine root biomass increased 26% with increased soil resource availability (relative to the low soil resources treatment), and showed little response to elevated [CO2]. Concentrations of N and soluble phenolics, and C/N ratio in roots were similar for the two species, but aspen had slightly higher lignin and lower condensed tannins contents compared to sugar maple. As predicted by source-sink models of carbon allocation, pooled constituents (C/N ratio, soluble phenolics) increased in response to increased relative carbon availability (elevated [CO2]/low soil resource availability), however, biosynthetically distinct compounds (lignin, starch, condensed tannins) did not always respond as predicted. We found that mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots was not strongly affected by atmospheric [CO2] or soil resource availability, as indicated by root ergosterol contents. Overall, absolute changes in root chemical composition in response to increases in C and soil resource availability were small and had no effect on soil fungal biomass or specific rates of fine root decomposition. We conclude that root contributions to soil carbon cycling will mainly be influenced by fine root production and turnover responses to rising atmospheric [CO2], rather than changes in substrate chemistry. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {Leaf-cutter ants are a prominent feature in Neotropical ecosystems, but a comprehensive assessment of their effects on ecosystem functions is lacking. We reviewed the literature and used our own recent findings to identify knowledge gaps and develop a framework to quantify the effects of leaf-cutter ants on ecosystem processes. Leaf-cutter ants disturb the soil structure during nest excavation changing soil aeration and temperature. They mix relatively nutrient-poor soil from deeper layers with the upper organic-rich layers increasing the heterogeneity of carbon and nutrients within nest soils. Leaf-cutter ants account for about 25% of all herbivory in Neotropical forest ecosystems, moving 10%–15% of leaves in their foraging range to their nests. Fungal symbionts transform the fresh, nutrient-rich vegetative material to produce hyphal nodules to feed the ants. Organic material from roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi enhances carbon and nutrient turnover in nest soils and creates biogeochemical hot spots. Breakdown of organic matter, microbial and ant respiration, and nest waste material decomposition result in increased CO2, CH4, and N2O production, but the build-up of gases and heat within the nest is mitigated by the tunnel network ventilation system. Nest ventilation dynamics are challenging to measure without bias, and improved sensor systems would likely solve this problem. Canopy gaps above leaf-cutter ant nests change the light, wind and temperature regimes, which affects ecosystem processes. Nests differ in density and size depending on colony age, forest type and disturbance level and change over time resulting in spatial and temporal changes of ecosystem processes. These characteristics remain a challenge to evaluate rapidly and non-destructively. Addressing the knowledge gaps identified in this synthesis will bring insights into physical and biological processes driving biogeochemical cycles at the nest and ecosystem scale and will improve our understanding of ecosystem biogeochemical heterogeneity and larger scale ecological phenomena.

abstract = {Root traits vary enormously among plant species but we have little understanding of how this variation affects their functioning. Of central interest is how root traits are related to plant resource acquisition strategies from soil. We examined root traits of 33 woody species from northeastern US forests that form two of the most common types of mutualisms with fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) and ectomycorrhizas (EM). We examined root trait distribution with respect to plant phylogeny, quantifying the phylogenetic signal (K statistic) in fine root morphology and architecture, and used phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) to test whether taxa forming different mycorrhizal associations had different root traits. We found a pattern of species forming roots with thinner diameters as species diversified across time. Given moderate phylogenetic signals (K = 0.44-0.68), we used PICs to examine traits variation among taxa forming AM or EM, revealing that hosts of AM were associated with lower branching intensity (r<inf>PIC</inf> = -0.77) and thicker root diameter (r<inf>PIC</inf> = -0.41). Because EM evolved relatively more recently and intermittently across plant phylogenies, significant differences in root traits and colonization between plants forming AM and EM imply linkages between the evolution of these biotic interactions and root traits and suggest a history of selection pressures, with trade-offs for supporting different types of associations. Finally, across plant hosts of both EM and AM, species with thinner root diameters and longer specific root length (SRL) had less colonization (r<inf>PIC</inf> = 0.85, -0.87), suggesting constraints on colonization linked to the evolution of root morphology. We examined root traits of 33 woody species co-existing in Northeastern US forests that form two of the most common types of mutualisms with fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) and ectomycorrhizas (EM). We found patterns of plants forming roots with thinner diameters as species diversified across time; and that the AM habit was associated with lower branching intensity (r<inf>PIC</inf> = -0.77) and thicker root diameter (r<inf>PIC</inf> = -0.41) and the EM habit.

abstract = {Microbes involved in decomposition within peatlands and the conditions that influence their activities have implications for C and greenhouse gas exchange. The objectives of this research were to characterize the role of fungal and bacterial activities in peatlands using selective antibiotic inhibition techniques across a nutrient gradient (rich to poor fens) and to search for environmental controls on the activity of each group. Bacterial activities predominated across a range of rich to poor boreal peatlands in central Ontario, Canada, although fungal activity became increasingly important in the poor sites. Linkages between soil pH and nutrient status and fungal and bacterial activities were found. However, they did not confirm our initial hypotheses that bacterial activity would be low in poor sites due to proton stress and low nutrient (particularly N) availability, whereas, fungal activity would be low in rich sites due to increased competitive ability of bacteria under near neutral pH conditions and high nutrient availability. Further work across these sites aimed at characterizing the phylogeny of the rhizosphere fungi is needed to determine if increased presence of mycorrhizae in poor sites could have explained our observed patterns. However, regardless of fungal: bacterial activity ratio differences across sites and its associated controls, microbial CO 2 production rates across fen types did not vary significantly, suggesting that the proportion of bacteria and fungi may not matter to broader carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in peat soils. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {A 3 year field and pot study was conducted to determine the effects of
several biotic and abiotic factors on the early growth of western
hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), western redcedar (Thuja
plicata, Donn) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis, Bong. Carr.)
seedlings established on 2- and 8-year-old clearcut sites previously
occupied by old-growth western hemlock and western redcedar forests
(referred to as younger and older CH, respectively), and on adjacent
2-year-old clearcut sites previously occupied by second-growth western
hemlock and amabilis fir (Amabilis amabilis (Dougl.) Forbes) forests
(referred to as younger HA) in coastal British Columbia. The objective
of the study was to determine which factors are associated with the poor
growth characteristic of the salal (Gaultheria shallon, Pursh) dominated
CH clearcut sites.
No soil moisture deficits were measured on any of the three types of
clearcut sites at any time of year. The best seeding growth was on the
younger HA sites followed by the younger CH sites and then the older CH
sites. The better growth on the younger HA sites was associated with a
higher availability of N and P in the first 20 cm depth of the forest
floor. No differences in matric soil water potential and pH, and only
small differences in soil temperature were measured between the three
types of clearcut sites. Complete removal of the competing vegetation on
the younger and older CH sites resulted in an increase in conifer
seedling growth and in the availability of N (22-40\%) and P (15-32\%);
however, it did not affect cellulose decomposition and matric soil water
potential, and increased soil temperature only slightly. Both western
hemlock and Sitka spruce seedlings were very responsive to differences
in nutrient availability measured between types of clearcut sites and
planting treatments. In contrast, western redcedar was not responsive.
All three conifer species had very high mycorrhizal colonization on the
younger CH sites, and this was not altered by the removal of the
competing vegetation (mainly salal).
These results suggest that the nutritional stress and poor growth of
conifers on salal-dominated CH clearcut sites in coastal British
Columbia can be explained by: (1) inherently low forest floor nutrient
availability; (2) competition between salal and conifer seedlings for
scarce nutrients and nutrient immobilization in salal; (3) declining
nutrient availability a few years after clearcutting and slashburning.},

abstract = {Plant-soil feedback (PSF) can provide a driving force during ecological succession by altering soil properties in ways that benefit or disadvantage other species in the successional sequence. Succession may be inevitable in disturbed sites remediated by planting early successional species, but information on PSF in such settings is lacking. We investigated whether gray birch (Betula populifolia), a native species but strong invader, alters succession from grassland to deciduous forest at a site contaminated with zinc, lead, and cadmium. We investigated PSF within the context of competition, herbivory, and soil contaminants, and evaluated whether gray birch, as a high metal accumulator, engages in elemental allelopathy, poisoning other species through its metal-contaminated leaf litter. We assessed the effects of gray birch on neighboring plant community structure, soil chemistry, fungal root symbionts, and the germination, growth, and herbivory of seedlings of black oak (Quercus velutina) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum), two tree species expected to follow gray birch in succession. Gray birch was associated with increased diversity in its neighborhood grassland community, increased herbivory on black oak seedlings, and influenced colonization by fungal root symbionts in both species. Seedling biomass was correlated with colonization by ectomycorrhizal fungi in black oak, but not with arbuscular mycorrhizal or dark septate fungal colonization in sugar maple. Gray birch had no effect on maple seedling performance or soil chemistry, and a small effect on black oak performance in the absence of aboveground competition. We found little evidence consistent with elemental allelopathy. Black oak and sugar maple seedlings responded more strongly to variation in soil nutrients than soil heavy metals, and they maintained leaf metal concentration profiles markedly different from those in their soils. We conclude that gray birch alters its environment in ways that could promote establishment and succession of woody species, potentially favoring those that are ectomycorrhizal, but most effects of PSF are overpowered by aboveground competition, herbivory, and/or existing abiotic soil factors. This study well illustrates why the potential for PSF to affect plant performance and community structure must be examined within the context of other ecological processes. Such a broad understanding can inform decisions made in the remediation and management of disturbed sites, and our understanding of plant succession and coexistence in general. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2019 Dietterich, Li, Garvey and Casper.},

abstract = {We used natural and tracer nitrogen (N) isotopes in a Pinus taeda free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment to investigate functioning of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi in N cycling. Fungal sporocarps were sampled in 2004 (natural abundance and 15N tracer) and 2010 (tracer) and $\delta$15N patterns were compared against litter and soil pools. Ectomycorrhizal fungi with hydrophobic ectomycorrhizas (e.g. Cortinarius and Tricholoma) acquired N from the Oea horizon or deeper. Taxa with hydrophilic ectomycorrhizas acquired N from the Oi horizon (Russula and Lactarius) or deeper (Laccaria, Inocybe, and Amanita). 15N enrichment patterns for Cortinarius and Amanita in 2010 did not correspond to any measured bulk pool, suggesting that a persistent pool of active organic N supplied these two taxa. Saprotrophic fungi could be separated into those colonizing pine cones (Baeospora), wood, litter (Oi), and soil (Ramariopsis), with $\delta$15N of taxa reflecting substrate differences. 15N enrichment between sources and sporocarps varied across taxa and contributed to $\delta$15N patterns. Natural abundance and 15N tracers proved useful for tracking N from different depths into fungal taxa, generally corresponded to literature estimates of fungal activity within soil profiles, and provided new insights into interpreting natural abundance $\delta$15N patterns. {\textcopyright} 2013 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract = {The mycelia of saprotrophic (SP) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi occur throughout the upper soil horizons in coniferous forests and could therefore be exposed to high concentrations of monoterpenes occurring in the needle litter of some tree species. Monoterpenes are mycotoxic and could potentially affect fungi that are exposed to them in the litter layers. In order to investigate whether monoterpenes typical of coniferous litters could influence fungal communities, we analysed the monoterpene content of freshly fallen needles of Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Picea sitchensis. The most abundant monoterpenes were found to be $\alpha$-pinene, $\beta$-pinene and 3-carene. We evaluated the effects of these three monoterpene vapours on the biomass production of 23 SP isolates and 16 ECM isolates. Overall, 75% of ECM isolates and 26% of SP isolates were significantly inhibited by at least one of the monoterpene treatments and both intra- and inter-specific variations in response were observed. Monoterpene concentrations are highest in surface litters. The differential effects on fungal taxa may influence the spatial and temporal distribution of fungal community composition, indirectly affecting decomposition and nutrient cycling, the fundamental ecosystem processes in which fungi have a key role in coniferous forest soils. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background and aims: Mycorrhizosphere is the interface between roots and soil where a myriad of microorganisms mediate plant growth, nutrient acquisition and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, and result in driving ecosystem biogeochemical cycling. Understanding the complexity and dynamics of mycorrhizosphere and its ecology and evolution are critical to enhancing forest productivity and ecosystem functioning, especially in high latitude temperate or high altitude alpine forests. However, the fungal community compositions and their driving ecological mechanisms of mycorrhizosphere during forest restoration are poorly documented. Methods: In this study, we simultaneously examined the ectomycorrhizal (EM) and rhizospheric fungal communities of two dominant host tree species (Abies faxoniana and Betula albosinensis) in subalpine forest communities with distinct forest restoration stages (30- vs. 60-year) after clear-cutting. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences was adopted. Results: A total of 1222 EM and 5880 rhizosphere fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained at a 97% sequence similarity level, which were mainly dominated by Basidiomycota. Host identity and forest restoration stage had no significant effects on fungal species richness of both EM and rhizospheric fungi. However, the community assembly of EM and rhizospheric fungi was significantly different during forest restoration, with opposite patterns shown on ectomycorrhizae and rhizosphere. The EM fungal community assembly was significantly affected by host identity, stand age and population dynamic, while the rhizosphere fungal community was significantly structured by combinations of host trees biomass, soil properties and spatial distance. Conclusions: Our data provide important insights that community assembly of EM and rhizosphere fungi may respond idiosyncratically during forest restoration, which will help us deeper understanding forest succession, stability and ecosystem functioning on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {As the range of bark beetles expands into new forests and woodlands, the need to understand their effects on multiple trophic levels becomes increasingly important. To date, much attention has been paid to the aboveground processes affected by bark beetle infestation, with a focus on photoautotrophs and ecosystem level processes. However, indirect effects of bark beetle on belowground processes, especially the structure and function of soil microbiota remains largely a black box. Our study examined the impacts of bark beetle-induced tree mortality on soil microbial community structure and function using high-throughput sequencing of the soil bacterial and fungal communities and measurements of extracellular enzyme activities. The results suggest bark beetle infestation affected edaphic conditions through increased soil water content, pH, electrical conductivity, and carbon/nitrogen ratio and altered bulk and rhizosphere soil microbial community structure and function. Finally, increased enzymatic activity suggests heightened microbial decomposition following bark beetle infestation. With this increase in enzymatic activity, nutrients trapped in organic substrates may become accessible to seedlings and potentially alter the trajectory of forest regeneration. Our results indicate the need for incorporation of microbial processes into ecosystem level models. IMPORTANCE Belowground impacts of bark beetle infestation have not been explored as thoroughly as their aboveground counterparts. In order to accurately model impacts of bark beetle-induced tree mortality on carbon and nutrient cycling and forest regeneration, the intricacies of soil microbial communities must be examined. In this study, we investigated the structure and function of soil bacterial and fungal communities following bark beetle infestation. Our results show bark beetle infestation to impact soil conditions, as well as soil microbial community structure and function. {\textcopyright} 2020 American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract = {Despite its importance to energy flow and nutrient cycling the process of fine root decomposition has received comparatively little detailed research. Disruption of the fine root-soil interface during preparation of root litterbags for decomposition studies could affect decay rates and nutrient mobilization in part by altering the community of decay organisms. We compared rates of decomposition and nutrient release from fine roots of pine between litterbags and intact cores and characterized the fungal community in the decomposing roots. Fine root decomposition was about twice as fast overall for intact cores than litterbags, and rapid mobilization of N and P was observed for roots in cores whereas nutrients were immobilized in litterbags. Fungal communities characterized using 454 pyrosequencing were considerably different between decaying roots in intact cores and litterbags. Most interesting, taxa from ectomycorrhizal fungal orders such as Boletales, Thelephorales and Cantharellales appeared to be more common in decaying roots from cores than litterbags. Moreover, the rate of N and P mobilization from decaying fine roots was highly correlated with taxa from two orders of ectomycorrhizal fungi (Thelephorales, Cantharellales). Although we caution that DNA identified from the decaying roots cannot be conclusively ascribed to active fungi, the results provide tentative support for a significant role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in decomposition and nutrient mobilization from fine roots of pine. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The widespread occurrence of mycorrhizae in nature and their importance in the mineral nutrition of almost all plants has been extensively documented but despite this mycorrhizae have not been included in nutrient cycling studies of forest ecosystems. This neglect may be due to a failure on the part of researchers to recognize the functional differences between mycorrhizae and roots and to the labour‐intensive effort needed to study mycorrhizae. Biomass or surface area of mycorrhizae must be measured before information on ion absorption by mycorrhizae can be applied to forest ecosystems. A full assessment of the importance of mycorrhizae in nutrient cycling also requires data on mycorrhiza production, senescence, and decomposition. Few mycorrhiza studies have provided such data. Consequently, our information on nutrient cycling is derived from fine root (≥ 5 mm in diameter) data which may or may not include mycorrhizae. Recent studies have shown that most of the organic input to the decomposition process results from fine root production. Fine root mortality and decomposition is also more important than other mechanisms for returning nitrogen immobilized in vegetation to the soil in both deciduous and coniferous forests. A recently completed study indicates that mycorrhizae account for 50% of the annual throughput of biomass and for 43% of the nitrogen released annually in a Douglas fir ecosystem. These transfers are five times larger than the releases from litterfall or litter decomposition. Clearly, the study of mycorrhizal nutrient cycling is in an embryonic state and considerable additional research is needed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1980, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract = {Climate warming is shifting the elevational boundary between forests and tundra upwards, but the related belowground responses are poorly understood. In the pristine South and Polar Urals with shifts of the treeline ecotone documented by historical photographs, we investigated fine root dynamics and production of extramatrical mycorrhizal mycelia (EMM) along four elevational transects reaching from the closed forest to the treeless tundra. In addition, we analysed elevational differences in climate and vegetation structure, and excavated trees to estimate related changes in the partitioning between below- and aboveground biomass. Fine root biomass of trees (<2 mm) increased by 13–79% with elevation, paralleled by a 35–72% increase in ground vegetation fine roots from the closed forest to the tundra. During the first year of decomposition, mass loss of fine root litter from different vegetation types was greater at lower elevations in the forest–tundra ecotone. The ratio between fine roots of trees and stem biomass largely increased with elevation in both regions, but these increases were not accompanied by a distinct production of EMM. Production of EMM, however, increased with the presence of ectomycorrhizal trees at the transition from the tundra to the forest. Our results imply that the recorded upward expansion of forest into former tundra in the Ural Mountains by 4–8 m per decade is decreasing the partitioning of plant biomass to fine roots. They further suggest that climate-driven forest advances will alter EMM production rates with potential feedbacks on soil carbon and nutrient cycling in these ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The integration of a comprehensive monitoring programme conducted in a temperate woodland through statistical analysis and simulation modelling is presented here. The Heron Wood Reserve in Peebleshire, Scotland is a 7.5-ha wood, left untended to facilitate investigation into a natural Scottish Woodland Ecosystem. Data on fungal fruiting have been collected since 1994, and since November 2000 physico-chemical and biotic experiments on soil and woodland litter have also been conducted with the aim to construct and integrate a number of simulation submodels of the various ecological systems present in an untended Scottish woodland. Important systems for modelling include patterns of fungal succession, habitat characteristics and fungal biochemical patterns. A large volume of data has been collected so computer software is used for the storage and handling of data. Microsoft Access was the database used for storage; integration of functions available in Microsoft Excel with a customised software written in Microsoft Visual Basic and Microsoft VBA allowed various statistical modelling tests (e.g. Scheff{\'{e}} analysis of contrast) to be carried out, and the quick display of data in a suitable manner. Model Maker software is used to construct and test simulation models formulated from the data and ultimately to facilitate the running of various simulations. Integration of the separate lines of investigation is demonstrated on the example of a case study describing differences in the dynamics of decomposers in beech- and birch-dominated habitats. Integration of the information obtained allowed us to put forward the following hypothesis. The leaf litter produced by beech trees is of lower quality compared to birch, and decomposition in beech-dominated habitats is delayed (i.e. in comparison to birch-dominated) because of the differences in the extent to which these plants create and maintain a litter and humus layer (sensu Wardle, Communities and Ecosystems. Linking the Aboveground and Belowground Components, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2002). Hence, the decomposition in beech-dominated habitats mainly occurs somewhat deeper in the soil profile, and may be carried out with some considerable involvement of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The correct understanding of the site-specific peculiarities of the ecological patterns is important for the improvement of biodiversity of woodland and forest ecosystems both in Scotland and worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we examine chemical changes in OM after fungal colonization in nitrogen fertilized and unfertilized soils from a Norway spruce forest. Methods: Sand-filled bags amended with composted maize leaves were placed in the forest soil and harvested after 17 months. Infrared and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopies were used to study the chemical changes in the OM. Fungal community composition of the bags was also evaluated. Results: The proportion of ectomycorrhizal fungi declined in the fertilized plots, but the overall fungal community composition was similar between N treatments. Decomposition of the OM was, independently of the N level or soil horizon, accompanied by an increase of C/N ratio of the mesh-bag content. Moreover, the proportions of carboxylic compounds in the incubated OM increased in the mineral horizon, while heterocyclic-N compounds decreased, especially in unfertilized plots with higher N demand from the trees. Conclusions: Our results indicate that more oxidized organic C and less heterocyclic-N proportions in the OM remain after fungal colonization in the mineral layers, and suggest that ectomycorrhizal fungi transfer less heterocyclic-N from the mesh bags to the host trees under high N levels. {\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Microbial communities in litter and soil are the functional link through which the tree species occupying a site may alter rates of soil processes fundamental to nutrient cycling and carbon flux. Through differences in the nature of their litter, their mycorrhizal fungal associates and the exudates they release into the rhizo/mycorrhizosphere, different tree species may give rise to distinct microbial communities in litter and soil. We examine the evidence that tree species influence the composition of the microbial communities in decomposing litter, forest floors, soil and the rhizo/mycorrhizosphere. The microbial communities considered in this review include bacteria, archaea, fungi and both free-living and symbiotic organisms. There is evidence that distinct microbial communities develop on decomposing leaf litters of different tree species, however, given the well-documented succession of microbes on decomposing litter, comparisons amongst tree species of microbial communities in litters and forest floors at the same stage of decay are needed to definitively deduce the influence of tree species. Distinct microbial communities have been reported in forest floors under different tree species; differences are most pronounced in the F layer. Distinctions in microbial communities in mineral soil under different tree species have been determined in several common garden experiments. The main factors associated with differences in microbial communities in litter, forest floors and soil are the pH and base cation content of the litter and whether the trees are broadleaf or coniferous. Identified differences in microbial communities in the rhizospheres of different tree species are more likely to be differences in the mycorrhizospheres and hyphospheres, given the predominance of associations with mycorrhizal fungi. Distinct microbial communities have been identified in the mycorrhizosphere under different tree species; these are influenced both by the tree species and by the mycorrhizal fungi with which the tree associates. Heightened attention during sampling to ensure comparison of 'like with like' could improve our ability to distinguish influence of tree species in decomposing litter, forest floors and soil. A significant remaining challenge is characterizing exudates from different tree-mycorrhizal fungi associations and understanding interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and microbial communities in the hyphosphere. A complete tapestry of the linkages between tree species and soil microbial communities requires that we also weave in the effects of soil fauna. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In nitrogen (N)-limited boreal forests, trees depend on the decomposing activity of their ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal symbionts to access soil N. A large fraction of this N exists as proteinaceous compounds associated with mineral particles. However, it is not known if ECM fungi can access these mineral-associated proteins; accordingly, possible acquisition mechanisms have not been investigated. With tightly controlled isotopic, spectroscopic, and chromatographic experiments, we quantified and analyzed the mechanisms of N acquisition from iron oxide mineral-associated proteins by Paxillus involutus, a widespread ECM fungus in boreal forests. The fungus acquired N from the mineral-associated proteins. The collective results indicated a proteolytic mechanism involving formation of the crucial enzyme–substrate complexes at the mineral surfaces. Hence, the enzymes hydrolyzed the mineral-associated proteins without initial desorption of the proteins. The proteolytic activity was suppressed by adsorption of proteases to the mineral particles. This process was counteracted by fungal secretion of mineral-surface-reactive compounds that decreased the protease–mineral interactions and thereby promoted the formation of enzyme–substrate complexes. The ability of ECM fungi to simultaneously generate extracellular proteases and surface-reactive metabolites suggests that they can play an important role in unlocking the large N pool of mineral-associated proteins to trees in boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

The species is an endemic and vulnerable species enlisted in the “A Preliminary Red List of Taiwanese Vascular Plants” according to the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria Version 3.1. G. flabilabella dwells the underground of broadleaf and coniferous forest with richness litter. Based on herbarium records, this species is distributed in central Taiwan. Twenty eight microsatellite loci were developed in G. flabilabella and were tested for cross-species amplification in additional taxa of G. confusoides, G. elata, and G. javanica. We estimated the genetic variation that is valuable for conservation management and the development of the molecular identification system for G. elata, a traditional Chinese medicine herb. Results: Microsatellite primer sets were developed from G. flabilabella using the modified AFLP and magnetic bead enrichment method. In total, 257 microsatellite loci were obtained from a magnetic bead enrichment SSR library. Of the 28 microsatellite loci, 16 were polymorphic, in which the number of alleles ranged from 2 to 15, with the observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.02 to 1.00. In total, 15, 13, and 7 of the loci were found to be interspecifically amplifiable to G. confusoides, G. elata, and G. javanica, respectively. Conclusions: Amplifiable and transferable microsatellite loci are potentially useful for future studies in investigating intraspecific genetic variation, reconstructing phylogeographic patterns among closely related species, and establishing the standard operating system of molecular identification in Gastrodia. {\textcopyright} 2014 Tsai et al.},

abstract = {Wildfires are a pervasive disturbance in boreal forests, and the frequency and intensity of boreal wildfires is expected to increase with climate warming. Boreal forests store a large fraction of global soil organic carbon (C), but relatively few studies have documented how wildfires affect soil microbial communities and soil C dynamics. We used a fire chronosequence in upland boreal forests of interior Alaska with sites that were 1, 7, 12, 24, 55, $\sim$90, and $\sim$100 years post-fire to examine the short- and long-term responses of fungal community composition, fungal abundance, extracellular enzyme activity, and litter decomposition to wildfires. We hypothesized that post-fire changes in fungal abundance and community composition would constrain decomposition following fires. We found that wildfires altered the composition of soil fungal communities. The relative abundance of ascomycetes significantly increased following fire whereas basidiomycetes decreased. Post-fire decreases in basidiomycete fungi were likely attributable to declines in ectomycorrhizal fungi. Fungal hyphal lengths in the organic horizon significantly declined in response to wildfire, and they required at least 24 years to return to pre-fire levels. Post-fire reductions in fungal hyphal length were associated with decreased activities of hydrolytic extracellular enzymes. In support of our hypothesis, the decomposition rate of aspen and black spruce litter significantly increased as forests recovered from fire. Our results indicate that post-fire reductions in soil fungal abundance and activity likely inhibit litter decomposition following boreal wildfires. Slower rates of litter decay may lead to decreased heterotrophic respiration from soil following fires and contribute to a negative feedback to climate warming. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) availability influences the productivity and distribution of plants in tropical montane forests. Strategies to acquire soil N, such as direct uptake of organic compounds or associations with root symbionts to enhance N acquisition in exchange for carbon (C), may facilitate plant species coexistence and ecosystem N retention. Alternatively, rapid microbial turnover of soil N forms in tropical soils might promote flexible plant N-uptake strategies and mediate species coexistence. We tested whether sympatric plant species with different root symbiont associations, and therefore potentially different nutrient acquisition strategies, partition chemical forms of N or show plasticity in N uptake in a tropical pre-montane forest in Panama. We traced the movement of three 15N forms into soil pools, microbes, and seedlings of eleven species differing in root traits. Seedlings were grown in a split-plot field transplant experiment, with plots receiving equimolar mixtures of ammonium, nitrate, and glycine, with one form isotopically labeled in each block. After 48 h, more 15N was recovered in microbes than in plants, while all pools (extractable organic and inorganic N, microbial biomass, and leaves) contained greater amounts of 15N from nitrate than from ammonium or glycine. Furthermore, 13C from dual-labeled glycine was not recovered in the leaves of any seedling, suggesting the studied species do not directly take up organic N or transform organic N prior to translocation to leaves. Nitrogen uptake differed by root symbiont group only for nitrate, with greater 15N recovery in plants with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations or proteoid roots compared to orchids. Some root trait groups differed in 15N recovery among N forms, with greater nitrate uptake than ammonium or glycine by AM-associated and N2-fixing plants. However, only five of eleven species showed differences in uptake among N forms. These results indicate flexibility in uptake of N forms in tropical plants across root trait groups, with only a few species displaying weak preferences for a specific N form. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract = {The abundance of fine roots and leaves in forests typically peaks during mid-succession and then declines. If fine root area declines more rapidly than leaf area, this could contribute disproportionately to stand decline. However, trees also partner with symbiotic ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi that facilitate nutrient acquisition of fine roots. Ectomycorrhizal fungi can use the carbohydrates provided by their plant partners to produce emanating fungal tissues which increase soil exploration potential but may also prove costly. We suggest two competing hypotheses to frame the response of ectomycorrhizas to stand age: (a) the ‘functional offset' hypothesis posits that the abundance of ectomycorrhizas with emanating tissues (‘Distance' mycorrhizas) increases with stand age and (b) the ‘energy-limited' hypothesis posits that carbon available for root symbionts decreases with stand age resulting in fewer Distance mycorrhizas. In the first hypothesis, EcM functional traits offset root abundance, while in the second, traits parallel root abundance. To test these competing hypotheses, we sampled fine roots to a depth of 90 cm and used allometric equations to estimate changes in root and leaf area index across a chronosequence of Pinus banksiana stands ranging from 2 to 76 years average tree age. We also examined fine roots microscopically to track changes in the abundance of EcM functional types. We used DNA-based methods to sequence EcM fungi and confirm roots were of P. banksiana. Both fine root and leaf area of pine increased for the first 30–36 years (until Mid age) and then plateaued, while the ratio of leaf to fine root area was similar across the age gradient. Also, changes to fine root area with stand age depended on soil depth. The abundance of Distance mycorrhizas was lowest at the youngest plots and increased until Mid age, where it peaked, contrary to the functional offset hypothesis. Instead, the abundance of Distance mycorrhizas paralleled changes to leaf area, aligned with the energy-limited hypothesis. Synthesis. Ectomycorrhizas do not offset the function of roots, rather shifts in exploration type likely reflect adjustments to carbon supply from hosts. {\textcopyright} 2020 British Ecological Society},

It was hypothesized that carbon accumulation typical for Histosols would mainly take place at the wet part ({\textordfeminine} wet site{\textordmasculine}) close to the lake shore and not at the drier part ({\textordfeminine} dry site{\textordmasculine}) of the forest. Rates of leaf litter decomposition, in situ soil C mineralization, and in situ N2 -fixation were higher at the wet site. Furthermore, the composition of the bacterial communities and the presence of ectomycorrhizas indicated sufficient O2 availability and high microbial vitality in the soil at the wet site. An anthropogenic lowering of the lake water table during the 1930s seems still to control the actual soil conditions, resulting in humus degradation in the two Histosols of the forest. The two soils clearly differed in productivity and C and N cycling, being controlled either by upland, acid runoff or by eutrophic lake water. Lake water seems to buffer but also to intensify microbial transformations at the wet site and to supply nutrients, although humus decay may possibly be decelerated by a temporarily high water table and refractory humic substances. {\textcopyright} 1997 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Plant productivity and ecosystem productivity are strongly influenced by nutrient availability, which is largely determined by the decomposition rate of plant litter. Belowground litter inputs (dead roots, mycorrhizae, and exudates) are larger than aboveground litterfall in many systems. Chemical quality and diameter primarily control decomposition for coarse roots, but these patterns do not hold for finer classes of roots, which are frequently colonized by mycorrhizae. Though mycorrhizal status is known to drastically alter root chemistry, morphology, life span, and exudation, it has never been explicitly considered as a factor affecting root decomposition. We hypothesize that mycorrhizal status substantially influences fine root decomposition rates. Both ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can change root properties but do so in different ways. Dominant tree species of most cold and temperate forests rely heavily on EM associations. EM fungi form massive structures that envelop fine roots. Roots infected by ectomycorrhizae have higher nitrogen concentrations than nonmycorrhizal roots, which would be expected to increase decomposition rates, but much of this nitrogen is bound in recalcitrant forms, such as chitin, so the net effect on decomposition is difficult to predict. AM fungi lack elaborate, macroscopic structures and may not alter root chemistry as profoundly. In addition to mycorrhizal roots, external fungal hyphae can contribute significantly to ecosystem carbon budgets and thereby influence rates of soil carbon turnover. Hyphae have commonly been considered a rapidly decomposing carbon pool, though this has never been demonstrated experimentally. If hyphae are produced at the expense of rapidly decomposing root exudates, then the net effect of hyphal litter production might be to reduce soil microbial activity and overall carbon cycling rates. Based on known differences in morphology and chemistry, EM hyphae may be more recalcitrant than AM hyphae. In summary, we submit that mycorrhizal status could substantially influence fine root decomposition and soil carbon processing rates, potentially explaining some of the variation observed within and among individual plant species and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Forest provides the most significant ecosystem services among the terrestrial ecosystems, and plays an important role in sequestering carbon (C) and mitigating the ongoing global climate change. Dissolved carbon (DC) and particulate carbon (PC) fluxes are important components in forest C budgets. Quantifying fluxes of DC and PC in forest ecosystems is essential to better understanding the C cycling processes and improving the assessment and prediction of C sequestration capacity in the ecosystems. However, the budgets of DC and PC have often been ignored in forest C cycling studies largely due to knowledge shortage and difficulty in taking measurements. Here, we reviewed the recent progress in DC and PC studies in forest ecosystems. We discussed the composition and function of DC and PC, associated ecological processes and influencing factors, and finally pointed out future research priorities in this field.
The DC and PC in a forest ecosystem mainly consist of dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved inorganic C (DIC), particulate organic C (POC), black C and carbonate C, which fundamentally originate from net primary production of the ecosystem. DOC, an important active pool of C and nutrients, is mainly composed of carbohydrates, long-chain aliphatic compounds, aromatic compounds, proteins, and low molecular weight organic acids. The DOC content is correlated positively with concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates, but negatively with concentrations of carboxyl C. The DOC in soil solution is mainly derived from plant litter, soil humus, microbial debris, root exudates, and ectomycorrhizal mycelium. DIC consists of dissolved inorganic carbonate, dissolved bicarbonate, dissolved carbonate and dissolved carbon dioxide. It activates soil nutrient elements and thus enhances plant growth. POC is the major form of PC in forest soils that includes polymeric gel, organic fiber, cell fragments, microbial biomass (such as algae and bacteria), and polymerized DOC. Both DC and PC are labile C pools in the forest soil system, which enter the ecosystem from atmospheric deposition, throughfall and litterfall, and leave the ecosystem via soil respiration, lateral transport and seepage. At a small local scale, fluxes of DC and PC are mainly influenced by such biotic factors as root exudates, fine root decomposition and microbial turnover. At a large regional scale, they are jointly affected by soil and vegetation characteristics, coupling effects of ecological processes, climatic conditions and global changes. Future research priorities in this field should be: (1) to explore the factors controlling fluxes of DC and PC in forest ecosystems on various spatio-temporal scales, their potential coupling relationships and underlying mechanisms; (2) to understand interactions and transformation between DC/PC and other C fluxes in forest ecosystems, and explore potential stoichiometric relationships between DC/PC and other nutrients in the systems and (3) to explore effects of global changes on fluxes of DC and PC in forest ecosystems, particularly focusing on the effects of extreme disturbances, such as forest management, wildfire, drought, flooding, ice and frozen, and freeze-thaw cycles. {\textcopyright} 2014, Science Press.

Three 10 x 10-m plots with different vegetation and positions on a slope were established: Top-Mixed, Top-Pinus, and Bottom-Pinus. Litter thickness in the Top-Mixed plot was the thinnest among the three plots. During the study, we counted 3563 fruiting bodies in 27 genera from 13 families. The dominant genera were Collybia, Marasmius, Mycena, Rhodophyllus, and Lactarius, and showed an intrageneric aggregated distribution at a quadrat size of 1 m2. Collybia and Lactarius formed fruiting bodies in arcs. The spatial distribution of Collybia, Marasmius, and Lactarius fruiting bodies tended to overlap in two consecutive years. In the Top-Mixed plot, the number of Marasmius fruiting bodies increased with increasing litter thickness, while that of Lactarius decreased with litter thickness. Values of C′ $\delta$ indicating degree of overlap were calculated for particular pairs of dominant fungal genera and the values differed between plots and years: for example, fruiting bodies of Marasmius and Mycena in the Bottom-Pinus plot were distributed aggregately in 1999 and 2000, but randomly in 2001, while they were distributed segregatedly in the Top-Pinus plot every year. Our study suggests that the spatial distribution of fungal fruiting bodies is affected by the distribution of litter in and between plots and that fungal flora is affected by vegetation. {\textcopyright} The Japanese Forest Society and Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract = {Microbial residue retention is critical for soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation in forests. However, the changes in soil microbial residues under atmospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition in tropical forests remain unclear. Here, we measured soil phospholipid fatty acids, enzyme activity, and amino sugars (biomarkers of microbial residues) in a seven-year N and P addition experiment in a secondary tropical montane rainforest. Our results showed that five years of nutrient additions showed no significant effect on microbial community structure but the effect became significant at the seventh year. In N addition plots, a decrease in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal biomass resulted in declines in the contribution of fungal residues to SOC and the ratio of fungal to bacterial residues. The fungi:bacteria ratio increased in P and N&P addition plots while the fungal residue:bacterial residue ratio was decreased by P addition, which may be related to an imbalance in microbial residue decomposition. Both extracellular enzyme activities and SOC showed minor changes under nutrient additions. Our results suggest that changes in microbial community structure and enzyme activity induced by N and P deposition may alter the accumulation and composition of microbial residues in SOC in N-rich tropical forests.},

Changes of environmental factors, especially of vegetation, soil, and fungal flora, were recorded for the 10 years following the treatment. The number of Shiro of T. matsutake and its fruit body production, began to increase 7 years after the thinning. The number of Shiro increased to about 2.4 times of that on the untreated plot. Ploughing of the litter layer was ineffective in propagating Shiro. By thinning the shrubs, the forest floor became dry and light, and litter accumulation decreased. The rate of formation of the A0 layer slowed, and the fine roots of P. densiflora, increased in the mineral soil horizon. Moreover, several species of other mycorrhizal fungi and some saprophytes, which were the competitors of T. matsutake, decreased remarkably in the treated plot.

We measured the effects of an invasive C4 grass (Microstegium vimineum) on soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition in a deciduous forest in south-central Indiana, USA. The unique 13C signature of the C4 grass relative to the C3 trees allowed us to partition soil CO2 fluxes and estimate M. vimineum effects on decomposition. The magnitude and direction of priming effects hinged on the soil characteristics, which related to the mycorrhizal association of dominant trees. In forest plots dominated by ectomycorrhizal trees, with low nitrogen availability and most SOM in particulate (i.e., unprotected) forms, M. vimineum increased SOM decomposition by 58%. In contrast, in plots dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal trees, characterized by high nitrogen availability and most SOM in mineral-associated (i.e., protected) forms, M. vimineum decreased decomposition by 14%. Collectively, our results demonstrate that invasive species can play a large role in altering ecosystem processes and suggest that the magnitude and direction of such effects depend on the dominant trees and edaphic characteristics of the stand. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In forests, roots account for a major component of carbon cycling, yet few studies have examined ranges of root trait variation and how different species vary in root form and function in these communities. • Root branching intensity, specific root length (SRL; root length per unit dry mass), root diameter, tissue density, phenolic concentration and nitrogen concentration were determined for the finest two root orders of 25 co-existing North American woody species sampled from mature plants in a single forest community. Trait correlations and multivariate patterns were examined to evaluate the most important trait differences among species. • Branching intensity, SRL, and phenolic concentration varied most widely among species (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.42, 0.57 and 0.58, respectively). Species predominately forming ectomycorrhiza (EM) had a higher branching intensity than those forming arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) with mycorrhizal types correctly predicted in c. 70% of individual observations by branching intensity alone. There was notably no correlation between SRL and nitrogen. Variation in SRL among species mapped partially along phylogenetic lines (consistency index (CI) = 0.44), with remaining variation attributable to differences in species' ecological specialization. • Variation found in root traits suggests different nutrient acquisition strategies within this community, which could have potential species-level effects on carbon and mineral nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2009 New Phytologist.},

Alterations in litter quality were characterized by solid-state 13 C NMR spectroscopy, pH, soluble sugars, ammonium, proteins, and phenol content determination and were associated with extracellular lignocellulolytic enzyme production. Differences in substrate decomposition related to litter type were observed for Leratiomyces ceres, achieving a higher k in the exotic L. lucidum litter, which might be attributed to the induction of manganese peroxidase activity. Substrate preference for alkyl C and more degradation of lignified compounds were found in such substrates. Although no statistical differences in mass loss were observed for the rest of the fungi assayed, we detected changes in several of the parameters evaluated. This suggests that exotic invasions may alter ecosystem functioning by accelerating decomposition processes through an increased fungal ligninolytic activity.},

We measured CO2 effluxes from different soil components (ground surface litter, roots, mycorrhizae, soil organic matter) at a large-scale burn experiment designed to simulate a severe but realistic potential future scenario for the region (Fire plot) in Mato Grosso, Brazil, over 1 year, and compared these measurements to replicated data from a nearby, unmodified Control plot. After four burns over 5 years, soil CO2 efflux (Rs) was $\sim$5.5 t C ha−1 year−1 lower on the Fire plot compared to the Control. Most of the Fire plot Rs reduction was specifically due to lower ground surface litter and root respiration. Mycorrhizal respiration on both plots was around $\sim$20% of Rs. Soil surface temperature appeared to be more important than moisture as a driver of seasonal patterns in Rs at the site. Regular fire events decreased the seasonality of Rs at the study site, due to apparent differences in environmental sensitivities among biotic and abiotic soil components. These findings may contribute toward improved predictions of the amount and temporal pattern of C emissions across the large areas of tropical forest facing increasing fire disturbances associated with climate change and human activities. {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Germination and seedling establishment of P. sylvestris were enhanced by reduction of the above ground components of E. hermaphroditum and P. schreberi but were not influenced by temporary disruption of mycorrhizal hyphae. Seedling growth and nitrogen content were, however, significantly increased when hyphal connections were disrupted and above ground influence of P. schreberi and E. hermaphroditum were reduced. Higher shoot:root ratios were also found in seedlings when hyphal connections were disrupted. Seedlings in treatments where P. schreberi was left intact and above ground interference by E. hermaphroditum was reduced had unusually low shoot:root ratios (1.6) after two growing seasons and significantly lower total amounts of nutrients after one growing season than were initially present in the seeds, indicative of a net nutrient drain during the early establishment phase. The experiment could not explain the mechanisms behind this unexpected nutrient drain. Possible rhizosphere interactions immobilizing nutrients and causing seedling nutrient losses are discussed. From the results of this study and other indirect evidence we hypothesize that the three biotic components we investigated could act together to immobilize nutrients and to inhibit tree seedling regeneration and growth in late successional stages of boreal forests.},

Here, we relate both saproxylic beetle and dominant polypore assemblages with woody decomposition rates and environmental variables in experimental partial cuts, clearcuts, and uncut controls using a series of causal models to determine the relationship between stand structure, biodiversity, and ecosystem function in black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) forests. Overall beetle and fungal composition differed between uncut stands and harvested stands. Main effects of harvesting included large increases in wood-feeding beetles and the fungus Gloeophyllum sepiarium (Wul.:Fr.) Karst. We suggest that these species were promoted by specific alterations in microhabitat conditions of deadwood. Within clearcuts specifically, changes in species composition and significantly more fungal degree-days resulted in significantly higher decomposition rates. We concluded that levels of partial cutting in the range of 15%-20% retention were not sufficient to maintain predisturbance communities but were sufficient to maintain wood decomposition rates similar to uncut stands.},

abstract = {The ecology of forest soils is an important field of research due to the role of forests as carbon sinks. Consequently, a significant amount of information has been accumulated concerning their ecology, especially for temperate and boreal forests. Although most studies have focused on fungi, forest soil bacteria also play important roles in this environment. In forest soils, bacteria inhabit multiple habitats with specific properties, including bulk soil, rhizosphere, litter, and deadwood habitats, where their communities are shaped by nutrient availability and biotic interactions. Bacteria contribute to a range of essential soil processes involved in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. They take part in the decomposition of dead plant biomass and are highly important for the decomposition of dead fungal mycelia. In rhizospheres of forest trees, bacteria interact with plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi as commensalists or mycorrhiza helpers. Bacteria also mediate multiple critical steps in the nitrogen cycle, including N fixation. Bacterial communities in forest soils respond to the effects of global change, such as climate warming, increased levels of carbon dioxide, or anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. This response, however, often reflects the specificities of each studied forest ecosystem, and it is still impossible to fully incorporate bacteria into predictive models. The understanding of bacterial ecology in forest soils has advanced dramatically in recent years, but it is still incomplete. The exact extent of the contribution of bacteria to forest ecosystem processes will be recognized only in the future, when the activities of all soil community members are studied simultaneously.

abstract = {Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is frequently planted as a monoculture, but it is also grown in mixed plantations with other native trees such as pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Both pine and oak form ectomycorrhizas that cover their roots and extend into the soil, facilitating tree water and nutrient uptake in exchange for photosynthetic carbon. Forming the interface between the soil and tree roots, mycorrhizal fungi are key drivers of biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems and play an important role in the successful establishment of tree seedlings. They can, however, be susceptible to changes in the soil environment and in their hosts. Both environment and neighboring hosts affect how fungi colonize roots and may affect their host preference. Despite the importance of mycorrhizal fungi in forest ecosystems, little is known about the biodiversity and functional effects of mycorrhizal communities in mixed compared with monoculture plantations. Changes in mycorrhizal richness and composition can result in changes in functional groups with consequences for forest ecosystem stability and functioning. We compared pine mycorrhizas in eight mixed plantations of pine and oak and eight pine monocultures in two forests in England, and we investigated the main factors driving their taxonomic and functional composition. Geographical location and litter pH explained over 50% of the variation in pine mycorrhizal communities. Different environmental factors affected taxonomic and functional composition across stands, indicating functional redundancy. Pine tended to associate with more fungi in the presence of oak, but the abiotic environment exerted a stronger influence than oak presence on pine mycorrhizal diversity. {\textcopyright} 2017},

abstract = {Atmospheric N deposition has far-reaching impacts on forest ecosystems, including on-site impacts such as soil acidification, fertilization, and nutrient imbalances, and off-site environmental impacts such as nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emission. Although chronic N deposition has been believed to lead to forest N saturation, recent evidence suggests that N retention capacity, particularly in the forest floor, can be surprisingly high even under high N deposition. This review aims to provide an overview of N retention processes in the forest floor and the implications of changing C-N interactions for C sequestration. The fate of available N in forest soils has been explained by the competitive balance between tree roots, soil heterotrophs, and nitrifiers. However, high rates of N retention have been observed in numerous N addition experiments without noticeable increases in tree growth and soil respiration. Alternative hypotheses have been proposed to explain the gap between the input and loss of N in N-enriched, C-limited systems, including abiotic immobilization and mycorrhizal assimilation, both of which do not require additional C sources to incorporate N in soil N pools. Different fates of N in the forest floor have different implications for C sequestration. N-induced tree growth can enhance C accumulation in tree biomass as observed across temperate regions. C loss from forests can amount to or outweigh C gain in N-saturated, declining forests, while another type of 'C-N decoupling' can have positive or neutral effects on soil C sequestration through hampered organic matter decomposition or abiotic N immobilization, respectively.},

abstract = {Increasing environmental concerns with forestry have led to mounting interest in mixedwood management as a possible strategy to achieve a diversity of ecological and productivity goals within the context of sustainable forest management. This review focuses on the effects of mixedwoods on biodiversity including understory plants, birds, soil fauna, and ectomycorrhizae (ECM). It examines stand-level species diversity and composition but particularly focuses on the regional scale (gamma diversity) by examining evidence for the occurrence of mixedwood-indicator species. The main conclusions are as follows: (i) The existence of different tree species in the canopy is associated with provision of a greater diversity of microhabitats allowing for the addition of understory plant species associated with each canopy species. However, there is little evidence for the existence of understory plant species uniquely associated with mixedwoods. (ii) Some bird species require or prefer the presence of different tree species within a landscape or within a stand. Mixed forest stands and landscapes are thus critical to support populations of these species. (iii) A few studies showed a positive effect of mixed stands or mixed litters on some groups of soil organisms, but high variability makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about any potential benefits of mixedwoods for biodiversity of soil fauna. (iv) Some ECM taxa are associated with multiple hosts, and could thus benefit from availability of multiple possible host species found in mixed forest stands. Several studies confirmed that there was a greater abundance of multiple-host ECM taxa in mixedwoods.},

abstract = {Mycoheterotrophic plants depend entirely on fungal associations for organic nutrients. While most mycoheterotrophic plants are associated with the mycorrhizal partners of surrounding green plants, some mycoheterotrophs are believed to obtain carbon from decaying litter or dead wood by parasitising saprotrophic fungi, based on culture experiments and 13C and 15N isotopic signatures. The carbon age (the time since carbon was fixed from atmospheric CO2 by photosynthesis) can be estimated by measuring the concentration of 14C arising from the bomb tests of the 1950s and 1960s. Given that mycorrhizal fungi obtain photosynthate from their plant partners, and saprotrophic wood-decaying fungi obtain carbon from older sources, radiocarbon could represent a new and powerful tool to investigate carbon sources of mycoheterotrophic plants. We showed that the $\Delta$14C values of mycoheterotrophs exploiting ectomycorrhizal fungi were close to 0‰, similar to those of autotrophic plants. By contrast, the $\Delta$14C values of mycoheterotrophs exploiting saprotrophic fungi ranged from 110.7‰ to 324.8‰, due to the 14C-enriched bomb carbon from dead wood via saprotrophic fungi. Our study provides evidence supporting that some mycoheterotrophic orchids depend on forest woody debris. Our study also indicates that radiocarbon could be used to predict the trophic strategies of mycoheterotroph-associated fungal symbionts. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

The sal forests were rich in macrofungi (115 species) with Polyporaceae being the largest family followed by Clavariaceae. Saprotrophic fungi were more common than mycorrhizal species. The proportion of mycorrhiza was <40% of the total macrofungi species which might have indicated the deteriorated condition of the forests before the initiation of conservation management. However, the proportion of mycorrhizal species was slightly higher in the forests managed for >10 years than in the forests managed for short period. The species richness increased with increasing canopy and litter cover. Since silvicultural activities and resource utilization often have negative impacts to macrofungal diversity, these activities need to be optimized to keep balance between forest management and biodiversity conservation. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Author(s).

abstract = {Archaea are microorganisms belonging to the third domain of cellular life on earth. Despite being unicellular microorganisms, they differ from the bacteria in many ways, and actually share an evolutionary history with the Eukaryotic branch of life. Since their discovery in extreme habitats, they have during the last two decades been found to inhabit almost all environments on Earth. Specific linages of archaea have been found to live forest soil ecosystems, and they have been found to be especially associated with boreal forest tree roots and mycorrhizospheres. These archaea belong to the so called Group I.1c of uncultured Thaumarchaeota (formerly included in the Phylum Crenarchaeota), and euryarchaeotal linages phylogenetically falling with the generally extremely halophilic Halobacteriales, as well as with methylotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens belonging to the Methanolobus and Methanosaeta, respectively. Norway spruce is one of the most common forest trees in the Fennoscandian boreal forest. Only few studies have thus far been conducted on archaea inhabiting the rhizosphere and mycorrhizosphere of boreal forest trees, and even fewer have concentrated on Norway spruce. However, it has been shown that the tree species has profound effect on the community composition of the archaea in the rhizosphere. When the tree roots are colonized by ectomycorrhizal fungi, the effect of the fungus dominates and the effect of the tree decreases. A spruce seedling grown in natural humus from a Scots pine stand gathered more detectable archaea in its roots than a Scots pine seedling, but when grown in natural humus from a Norway spruce stand the detectable number of archaea in the Norway spruce roots was much reduced. It has been shown that different tree species affect the soil they live in, and that Norway spruce has a tendency to acidify the soil, while for example silver birch increase the soil pH. Acidic spruce needle litter also bring recalcitrant organic matter and phenolics to the soil, while birch litter increase soil organic matter and nitrogen. An even greater difference between tree species can be detected in the composition of bacterial groups in the rhizospheres and mycorrhizospheres of different boreal forest tree species. The fact that archaea are generally found only in the roots and rhizosphere, and not in the soil uncolonized by mycorrhizal fungi or tree roots indicate a relationship between the archaea and the ectomycorrhizal fungi and the tree. This chapter will concentrate on the archaea detected in the roots and mycorrhizosphere of boreal forest Norway spruce in comparison to other boreal tree species, but will also shortly touch on the subject of bacteria. {\textcopyright} 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract = {In a study of fungi growing in various root-associated habitats in and around Picea mariana, black spruce, in northern Ontario, Canada, an examination was made of the degree to which differences in growth sites within an area of a few square kilometers might influence the structure of root-associated filamentous microfungal populations. Picea mariana roots were collected at four strongly differing boreal forest sites: an undisturbed forest site with deep litter and humus layers; a recently regenerated forest; a clearcut, former portable sawmill site with a few small, naturally regenerated trees; and an open peat bog penetrated by roots from trees growing along the margin. Comparisons were done on isolate assemblages primarily from serially washed mycorrhizae, supplemented with comparison samples from washed root bark and adherent rhizosphere soil. The Bray & Curtis similarity index and nodal components analysis were utilised to identify trends within the data. Root endophyte fungi, mainly Phialocephala fortinii and Meliniomyces variabilis, were among the most common isolates from serially washed mycorrhizae and showed strong trends among the site types, with the former most common from sites low in humus and also low in known humus-associated microfungi, and the latter most common from the peat bog site. The overall composition of the isolate assemblages from washed mycorrhizae mainly reflected site factors, with assemblages from the undisturbed and regenerated forest sites similar to one another and those from the clearcut and peat bog sites strongly distinct. A major difference was also seen between two seasonal samples at the exposed clearcut site, but few seasonal differences were seen at the other sites. The regenerated and undisturbed forest sites were high in Umbelopsis isabellina, Mortierella verticillata and Penicillium spinulosum, fungi typical of humic horizons in boreal podzols; the clearcut yielded the greatest numbers of Fusarium proliferation, Umbelopsis nana and Penicillium montanense isolates, an assemblage tending to indicate exposed mineral soil; while the peat bog was typified by the presence of characteristic northern peat inhabitants Mortierella pulchella and P. spinulosum, as well as temperate peat inhabitant Penicillium lividum. A synthesis of these results with other data suggests that as a microhabitat, the mycorrhizosphere, as originally defined by Foster & Marks, is of little significance in determining the structure of filamentous fungal populations in soil influenced by the presence of ectomycorrhizal forest tree roots. Edaphic and overall microbial community conditions are much more significant, but the influence of a "symbiorhizosphere effect" exerted by certain ectomycorrhizal symbionts within the whole soil volume they occupy is also known in some cases and worthy of further investigation.},

abstract = {Nutrient cycling is greatly influenced by dominant plants that contribute high amounts of leaf litter to soils; however, less-dominant and rare species can play keystone roles in nutrient cycling if they have unique nutrient acquisition traits and provide high-quality litter. In many parts of the world, wildfire is likely to become more frequent and intense under a changing climate. The effect this will have on plant rarity and on species with unique nutrient acquisition traits, and thus nutrient cycling, remains poorly understood. Working within an Australian box-ironbark forest, we determined if a relationship existed between species rarity and the uniqueness of their leaf nutrient profiles, and if this relationship changed after prescribed burning. We created an index of species rarity from a data set of woody perennial species abundance in areas before and after autumn or spring burns, or left unburnt. We created indices of uniqueness for the leaf nutrient profiles of 42 woody perennial species occurring in the ecosystem, based on amounts of six macronutrients and four micronutrients found in fresh and senesced leaves of each species. Five nutrient acquisition strategies (mycorrhizal, N-fixing, carnivorous, hemiparasitic and proteoid roots) were represented in the data set. There was no community-wide relationship between rarity and uniqueness of leaf nutrient profiles, and this did not change as a result of fire. However, two hemiparasitic species were relatively rare in the ecosystem studied, and differed greatly from other species due to high K and P in senesced leaves. Thus, some of the rarest species, such as hemiparasites, can be functionally unique. Understanding the functional characteristics of rare species is important so that unique functional contributors can be identified and conserved to prevent local extinction. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018.},

This study examined the effects of CC and SB on soil CO2 efflux components in a Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook (Chinese fir, CF) plantation and a secondary evergreen broadleaved forest (BF) located in Fujian Province, southeastern China. Aboveground litter removal and root trenching were used to estimate CO2 fluxes from soil organic matter decomposition (RSOM), litter decomposition (RL), and autotrophic respiration by roots and mycorrhizae (RR). These components were measured 5–7 times per month from 18 October 2001 to 25 December 2003 using soda lime absorption. We found that RR, RL and RSOM were initially higher in CC and SB plots than controls in both forests, but these three component fluxes in disturbed plots all fell below those of the control 5–20 months after the disturbance. Also, Q10 values of these components decreased following disturbance. The annual flux of each respiration component was greater under BF than CF. The contribution of RR to soil CO2 efflux in the control plots averaged 35% in CF and 46% in BF. RSOM was the dominant component of soil CO2 efflux in CC and SB plots, accounting for over 50%. Our results highlight the importance of temporal trends of the component fluxes following disturbance and contribute to a broader understanding of forest management effects on the soil C cycle. {\textcopyright} 2016 British Society of Soil Science},

abstract = {Aims: Ecological forest succession can be influenced by plant-plant interactions that exert contrasting effects on early- and late-successional species. In this study, we explored the role of indirect plant-plant interactions and the underlying microbial mechanisms in forest succession. Methods: In a mesocosm experiment, we used Schima superba, a widespread mid-successional species in subtropical China, as a model species to explore how inoculating the rhizosphere soil of Schima affected the performances of two early-successional species (Pinus massoniana and Rhodomyrtus tomentosa) and two late-successional species (Cryptocarya chinensis and Machilus chinensis). All direct and indirect correlations between plant performance and soil microbial composition were examined using partial least square path models. Results: Schima inoculum inhibited the growth of the early-successional species but had little effect on the growth of the late-successional species. Inoculation reduced non-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (non-AMF) colonization in both species groups but increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization in the late-successional species. The percentage of root lesions in the early-successional species increased with inoculation, while that in the late-successional species decreased. Plant nutrient acquisition was not responsive to inoculation. According to the path models, soil microbes explained 51% of the growth variances in the early-successional species but barely explained any growth variances in the late species. Conclusions: Schima may increase the competitive advantage of the late-successional species over early-successional species by inhibiting the mutualistic association between non-AMF and the latter, which in turn may facilitate forest succession. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {Background: The predictive power of climate models is limited by an incomplete understanding of the controls on fine root decomposition and thus belowground carbon cycling. To more accurately model rates of decay, fine root heterogeneity needs to be addressed in fine root decomposition studies. Branching order integrates both structural and chemical properties that are important in indicating litter quality and decay rate. Scope: We discuss current views on the controls and patterns of fine root decomposition in combination with recent findings related to the effects of branching order and mycorrhizal decomposition. We examine the counterintuitive finding that nitrogen rich, lower order roots decompose more slowly than woody, higher order roots in temperate and sub-tropical forests. Conclusions: We posit that slower decomposition of first and second compared to higher order roots might be caused by the poor carbon quality associated with higher concentrations of phenols in lower order roots or by inhibition of saprophytes by the mycorrhizal fungi that often preferentially inhabit these roots. Alternatively, apparent recalcitrance of lower order roots could be an experimental artifact caused by severing pre-mortem mycelial connections during sample processing, or exclusion of animals that graze fungal structures by the small mesh sizes characteristic of litterbags. To better predict the residence time of the carbon contained in the entire fine root pool, existing methods should be applied to individual root orders when practical. New methods for characterizing decomposition of undisturbed roots that have senesced naturally are greatly needed. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

Leaf litter fall from trees and seedlings were analysed for nutrients. Growth of trees was not affected by added P. Transplanted seedlings survived better in the controls than added-P subplots: they did not grow better with added-P. M. bisulcata wildlings survived slightly better in the added-P subplots in yr 1 but not later. Litter fall and transplanted survivors had much higher concentrations of P (not N) in the added-P than control subplots.

abstract = {This study aims at characterizing the diversity and temporal changes of species richness and composition of fungi in an ecotone of a forest border and a meadow in the Taunus mountain range in Germany. All macroscopically visible, epigeous fungi and vascular plants were sampled monthly over three years, together with climatic variables like humidity and temperature that influence fungal diversity and composition as shown by previous studies. In this mosaic landscape, a total of 855 fungal species were collected and identified based on morphological features, the majority of which belonged to Ascomycota (51 %) and Basidiomycota (45 %). Records of fungal species and plant species (218) for this area yielded a fungus to plant species ratio of 4:1, with a plant species accumulation curve that reached saturation. The three years of monitoring, however, were not sufficient to reveal the total fungal species richness and estimation factors showed that a fungus to plant species ratio of 6:1 may be reached by further sampling efforts. The effect of climatic conditions on fungal species richness differed depending on the taxonomic and ecological group, with temporal patterns of occurrence of Basidiomycota and mycorrhizal fungi being strongly associated with temperature and humidity, whereas the other fungal groups were only weakly related to abiotic conditions. In conclusion, long-term, monthly surveys over several years yield a higher diversity of macroscopically visible fungi than standard samplings of fungi in autumn. The association of environmental variables with the occurrence of specific fungal guilds may help to improve estimators of fungal richness in temperate regions. {\textcopyright} 2018 Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) constitutes the largest terrestrial C pool. An emerging, untested, view is that oxidation and depolymerization of SOM by microorganisms promote the formation of SOM-mineral associations that is critical for SOM stabilization. To test this hypothesis, we performed laboratory-scale experiments involving one ectomycorrhizal and one saprotrophic fungus that represent the two major functional groups of microbial decomposers in the boreal forest soils. Fungal decomposition enhanced the retention of SOM on goethite, partly because of oxidative modifications of organic matter (OM) by the fungi. Moreover, both fungi secreted substantial amounts (> 10% new biomass C) of aromatic metabolites that also contributed to an enhanced mineral retention of OM. Our study demonstrates that soil fungi can form mineral-stabilized SOM not only by oxidative conversion of the SOM but also by synthesizing mineral surface-reactive metabolites. Metabolites produced by fungal decomposers can play a yet overlooked role in the formation and stabilization of SOM. {\textcopyright} 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Leaf and root litter decomposition has been a major research focus. However, the possible effects of belowground microbial community structure and diversity on this process are poorly understood. Understanding the biochemical mechanisms controlling aboveground decomposition processes is important to predict the changes of soil carbon and nutrient cycling in response to changes of forest management regimes. Here, we explore the biochemical controls of leaf and fine root decomposition in three subtropical plantations (Ford Erythrophleum (Erythrophleum fordii Oliver), Masson Pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.)), and a mixed plantation containing both species) using the litterbag method, and soil microbial communities were determined using phospholipid fatty acid profiles. Overall, leaves decomposed more rapidly than fine roots, potentially due to the faster degradation of their cellulose component, but not lignin. In addition, leaf and fine root decomposition rates varied among plantations, being higher in E. fordii and lower in P. massoniana. Substrate quality such as N, Ca, lignin concentration, and C/N ratio were responsible for the decomposition rate changes among plantation types. Moreover, we used redundancy analysis to examine the relationships between litter decomposition and soil microbial community composition and diversity. Results revealed that actinobacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi community were the key determinants affecting leaf and fine root litter decomposition, respectively. Our work demonstrates that litter decomposition was linked to substrate quality and to the structure of soil microbial communities, and evidences the probable role of E. fordii in increasing soil nutrient availability, especially N, P and Ca. Additional data on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) or DNA marker groups within the litterbags over time may provide insights into litter decomposition dynamics, which represents potential objectives for future long-term decomposition studies. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors.},

abstract = {Despite the important roles of microorganisms in soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and nutrient cycling, how their biomass, community composition and function are driven by a joint effect of edaphic and environmental factors at a large spatial scale remains unclear. Moreover, a mechanistic understanding of the associations among microbial communities and SOM chemistry as a key indicator of substrate availability over large spatial scales has been lacking until now. To fill this knowledge gap, we examined how soil microbial community abundance and composition (via phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis) and function (via enzyme activities and net N mineralization) were associated with the edaphic and environmental factors from six oriental oak (Quercus variabilis) forest sites arranged across a 11° latitudinal gradient in East China. We found strong relationships between SOM chemistry as indicated by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and microbial community composition and function along this gradient. For example, the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F/B) decreased with increasing carboxyl C percentage; the lower abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and decreased invertase activity in the southern sites were possibly related to higher ratio of alkyl to O alkyl (A/O); urease activity increased with carboxyl C percentage. Microbial biomass (total PLFAs) had positive relationships with urease activity, net N mineralization rate, and soil pH. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) and pH were important for overall microbial community composition. Overall, our results indicate that SOM chemistry is closely related to microbial community composition and function along the latitudinal gradient and should be considered in future studies. Our study contributes to a better prediction of microbial responses to possible substrate changes brought by future environmental changes, which is urgently needed under the context of accelerating global change. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Key message: Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community structure and potential exoenzymatic activity change after clearcut harvesting, but functional complementarity and redundancy among those ECM fungal species remaining support growth of regenerating seedlings. Abstract: Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community composition is altered by forest harvesting, but it is not clear if this shift in structure influences ECM fungal physiological function at the community level. In this study, we characterized activities of extracellular enzymes in the ectomycorrhizospheres of Picea engelmannii seedlings grown in forest and clearcut plots. These exoenzymes are critical for the breakdown of large organic molecules, from which nutrients are subsequently absorbed and translocated by ECM fungi to host plants. We found that ectomycorrhizae on seedlings planted in forests had different exoenzyme activity profiles than those on seedlings planted in clearcuts. Specifically, the activities of glucuronidase, laccase, and acid phosphatase were higher on forest seedlings (P ≤ 0.006). These differences may have been partly driven by soil properties. Total carbon, total nitrogen (N), extractable phosphorus, extractable ammonium-N, and mineralizable N were higher, while pH was lower in forest plots (P ≤ 0.01). However, we also found that enzyme activity only shifted where community composition also changed. Functional complementarity can be inferred within ECM fungal communities in both forests and clearcuts because ectomycorrhizae formed by different species in the same environment had distinct enzyme profiles (P < 0.0001). However, ectomycorrhizae of Thelephora terrestris exhibited high levels of N- and P-mobilizing exoenzyme activities. Seedling biomass did not differ between forest and clearcut environments, so the high abundance of T. terrestris ectomycorrhizae in the clearcuts may have sustained nutrient acquisition by clearcut seedlings even in soils with lower N and P and with reduced ECM fungal species richness. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Mulching with wood chips should contribute to revitalize soil fauna and restore natural forests on degraded soils. Scots pine seedlings were planted at the post-military training ground. Four experimental treatments were tested: control-uncovered soil (C), mulching with wood chips (W),W+ mycorrhiza preparation (WM), andW+ forest litter (WL). At the end of the growing season in 2012, 2013 and 2014, the following plant measurements were carried out: length of annual increment of the main stem, stem base diameter, number and lengths of lateral shoots in the annual whorl. The mite calculations included average mite density, dominance index, species richness, oribatid mite diversity, average number of species, and Shannon general species diversity index. The use of mulching with wood chips did not significantly affect the growth characteristics of Scots pine plants, but strongly increased the mite community. After mulching, the total number and species diversity of Acari increased many times, and Oribatida began to dominate among micro-arthropods. The number of Oribatida increased most in W. The largest species diversity was observed in WL. 24 species of Oribatida were found that were used as the bio-indicators of soil succession changes. Tectocepheus velatus clearly dominated in all mulching treatments. Oppiella nova and Scutovertex sculptus were also numerous populations of Oribatida. The study shows that mulching with Scots pine wood chips, especially with the addition of forest litter, significantly enriches soil fauna and is therefore useful in the regeneration process of degenerated forest soils. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

By deploying common fungal necromass substrates in a temperate oak savanna and hardwood forest in the midwestern USA, we assessed the generality of the rate at which high- and low-quality fungal necromass decomposes; further, we investigated how the decomposer ‘necrobiome' varies both across and within sites under vegetation types dominated by either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal plants. The effects of necromass quality on decay rate were robust to site and vegetation type differences, with high-quality fungal necromass decomposing, on average, 2.5 times faster during the initial stages of decay. Across vegetation types, bacterial and fungal communities present on decaying necromass differed from bulk soil microbial communities and were influenced by necromass quality. Moulds, yeasts and copiotrophic bacteria consistently dominated the necrobiome of high-quality fungal substrates. Synthesis. We show that regardless of differences in decay environments, high-quality fungal substrates decompose faster and support different types of decomposer micro-organisms when compared with low-quality fungal tissues. These findings help to refine our theoretical understanding of the dominant factors affecting fast cycling components of soil organic matter and the microbial communities associated with rapid decay. {\textcopyright} 2020 British Ecological Society},

The concentration of DOC was reduced by 40%, while citrate was reduced by up to 90% in the soil solution by the girdling treatment. Other LMWOA such as oxalate, succinate, formate and propionate were unaffected by the girdling. We also found that girdling reduced the concentrations of trehalose (by 50%), a typical fungal sugar, and of monosaccharides (by 40%) in microorganisms in root-free soil. The effect of freezing on DOC concentrations was marked in samples from control plots, but insignificant in samples from girdled plots. Release of DOC from cell lysis after freezing was attributed equally to roots and to microorganisms. Our observations suggest a direct link from tree photosynthesis through roots and their mycorrhizal fungi to soil solution chemistry. This direct link should impact solute transport and speciation, mineral weathering and C dynamics in the soil compartment. Importantly, our finding of a substantial photosynthate driven production of DOC challenges the paradigm that DOC is mainly the result of decomposition of organic matter. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract = {Tropical forest productivity is sustained by the cycling of nutrients through decomposing organic matter. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a key role in the nutrition of tropical trees, yet there has been little experimental investigation into the role of AM fungi in nutrient cycling via decomposing organic material in tropical forests. We evaluated the responses of AM fungi in a long-term leaf litter addition and removal experiment in a tropical forest in Panama. We described AM fungal communities using 454-pyrosequencing, quantified the proportion of root length colonised by AM fungi using microscopy, and estimated AM fungal biomass using a lipid biomarker. AM fungal community composition was altered by litter removal but not litter addition. Root colonisation was substantially greater in the superficial organic layer compared with the mineral soil. Overall colonisation was lower in the litter removal treatment, which lacked an organic layer. There was no effect of litter manipulation on the concentration of the AM fungal lipid biomarker in the mineral soil. We hypothesise that reductions in organic matter brought about by litter removal may lead to AM fungi obtaining nutrients from recalcitrant organic or mineral sources in the soil, besides increasing fungal competition for progressively limited resources.},

abstract = {Allelopathy is one of the factors That determine interactions among plants. Allelochemicals have been found in many forest ecosystems, but the importance of allelopathic interactions depends on forest type and environmental conditions. Despite the wide presence of this phenomenon, its modelization has been little developed, but its inclusion should be carefully considered in forest models dealing with environmental stress, exotic plant invasions (or introduction) and ecological succession. In these situations, multiple factors influence allelochemical production or toxicity such as nutrient availability, soil moisture and texture, solar radiation, and temperature, among others. Ecosystem-level effects of allelopathy are changes in germination rates, inhibition of seedling growth, mycorrhizal function, insect and bacterial growth, inhibition of nitrification or litterfall decomposition and dieback of mature trees. In this work, a comprehensive conceptual model on the interactions between different factors suitable to be incorporated in ecosystem-level models is presented. In addition, to illustrate the utility of simulating allelopathy, a virtual experiment was carried out with the forest ecosystem-level model FORECAST applied in a forest of western red-cedar (Thuja plicata) interacting with the ericaceous understory shrub salal (Gaultheria shallon) in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Our results showed different effects of allelopathy on several ecological variables depending on the type of allelopathic influence simulated, with important reductions in predicted merchantable volume when reduction in germination and litterfall decomposition by allelopathy was simulated. Furthermore, a great increase in understory biomass was also predicted as consequence of allelopathy. This experiment showed the suitability of ecosystem-level models to simulate, if not directly allelopathic interactions, at least the ecological effects of allelopathy at the ecosystem level. Overall, this work pointed out that forest managers and researches should think carefully about the inclusion of allelopathy as a way of improving the accuracy of forest models.},

abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal fungi are thought to have a key role in mobilizing organic nitrogen that is trapped in soil organic matter (SOM). However, the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi decompose SOM and the mechanism by which they do so remain unclear, considering that they have lost many genes encoding lignocellulose-degrading enzymes that are present in their saprotrophic ancestors. Spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome profiling were used to examine the mechanisms by which five species of ectomycorrhizal fungi, representing at least four origins of symbiosis, decompose SOM extracted from forest soils. In the presence of glucose and when acquiring nitrogen, all species converted the organic matter in the SOM extract using oxidative mechanisms. The transcriptome expressed during oxidative decomposition has diverged over evolutionary time. Each species expressed a different set of transcripts encoding proteins associated with oxidation of lignocellulose by saprotrophic fungi. The decomposition 'toolbox' has diverged through differences in the regulation of orthologous genes, the formation of new genes by gene duplications, and the recruitment of genes from diverse but functionally similar enzyme families. The capacity to oxidize SOM appears to be common among ectomycorrhizal fungi. We propose that the ancestral decay mechanisms used primarily to obtain carbon have been adapted in symbiosis to scavenge nutrients instead. {\textcopyright} 2016 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract = {In this study, we explore two mycorrhizal groups during development of riparian soils along a freely-flowing river. We provide the first documentation of a shift in abundance between arbuscular mycorrhizae and ectomycorrhizae during floodplain succession. We used a chronosequence spanning 0-70 yr along a river in northwestern Montana, USA, to test the hypothesis that abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is greatest in early stages of soil development, and abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF) is greatest later in floodplain succession. We also measured the AMF-mediated process of formation of soil aggregates during site development. AMF colonization of the dominant tree (black cottonwood, Populus trichocarpa) remained low (<5%), while AMF colonization of understory species was high (45-90%), across the chronosequence. Mycorrhizal inoculum potential (MIP) and hyphal length of AMF in soil peaked within the first 13 yr of succession and then declined. No single variable significantly correlated with AMF abundance, but AMF tended to decline as litter and soil organic matter increased. Density of ectomycorrhizal root tips in soil increased linearly throughout the chronosequence, and ectomycorrhizal colonization of cottonwood roots increased rapidly in early stages of succession. These patterns suggest that ECMF are not limited by dispersal, but rather influenced by abundance of host plants. Formation of water stable aggregates increased rapidly during the first third of the chronosequence, which was the period of greatest AMF abundance in the soil. The peak in AMF infectivity and hyphal length during early succession suggests that regular flooding and establishment of new sites promotes AMF abundance in this ecosystem. Regulation of rivers that eliminates creation of new sites may reduce contributions of AMF to riparian areas. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

Observations under a light microscope gave circumstantial evidence of the role of these fungi in advanced stages of decomposition: they seem to protect the partly decayed plant material and the faeces deposited by soil animals from subsequent attack by soil bacteria. Penetration of pine needles and cadavers or soil arthropods is prominent in so far as animals have previously made entries by tunnelling into the substrates. In addition the black mycorrhizal fungus Cenococcum geophilum was observed to penetrate bracken epidermal cells by its own means and to make lysis zones in dead arthropod cuticles.

This may potentially result in a fundamental transformation of contemporary Northern European forests, with tentative effects on the associated belowground fungi. Fungal communities mediate vital ecosystem processes such as ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration in boreal forests. To investigate how soil fungi is affected by the vegetation transition from spruce to beech forest, we sampled litter, humus and mineral soil in a forest landscape dominated by beech, spruce or a mixture of these. The fungal communities in the soil samples were analyzed by DNA metabarcoding of the rDNA ITS2 region. Although soil layers were the most important structuring gradient, we found clear differences in fungal species composition between spruce and beech plots. The differences in fungal community composition were most evident in the litter and least in the mineral soil. Decomposers, most notably Mycena, dominated the litter layer while various mycorrhizal fungi dominated the humus and mineral layers. Some ectomycorrhizal taxa, such as Cenoccocum and Russula, were more abundant in spruce forests. Differences in fungal community composition between forest types can potentially have large impacts on carbon sequestration rates. {\textcopyright} FEMS 2018.},

It is crucial to understand the differences in soil C and N cycles between AM and EM forests and the underlying mechanisms. In this review, we first compared the differences in the soil C and N cycles between AM and EM forests, and synthesized the underlying mechanisms from perspectives of the inputs, stabilization, and outputs of soil C and N in forest ecosystems. We also compared the responses of soil C and N cycles between AM and EM forests to global changes. In this field, one major research priority is comparing the structure and function (including the soil C and N cycles) between AM and EM forest ecosystems to provide theoretical basis and solid data for improving forest productivity and ecosystem services. The second research focus is deepening the understanding of the effects of interactions between aboveground litter and belowground mycorrhiza and free-living microbes on soil C and N cycles to reveal the potential underlying mechanisms in forests with different mycorrhizal symbioses. Third, the research methodology and new techniques need refining and applying to explicitly focus on scaling up the fine-scale measurements to better expound and predict the C and N cycles in forest ecosystems. Finally, more studies on the stability of soil organic matter among different mycorrhizal forests are needed to precisely assess responses of the structure and function of forest ecosystems to global changes.},

abstract = {Root-associated fungi, particularly ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), are critical symbionts of all boreal tree species. Although climatically driven increases in wildfire frequency and extent have been hypothesized to increase vegetation transitions from tundra to boreal forest, fire reduces mycorrhizal inoculum. Therefore, changes in mycobiont inoculum may potentially limit tree-seedling establishment beyond current treeline. We investigated whether ectomycorrhizal shrubs that resprout after fire support similar fungal taxa to those that associate with tree seedlings that establish naturally after fire. We then assessed whether mycobiont identity correlates with the biomass or nutrient status of these tree seedlings. The majority of fungal taxa observed on shrub and seedling root systems were EMF, with some dark septate endophytes and ericoid mycorrhizal taxa. Seedlings and adjacent shrubs associated with similar arrays of fungal taxa, and there were strong correlations between the structure of seedling and shrub fungal communities. These results show that resprouting postfire shrubs support fungal taxa compatible with tree seedlings that establish after wildfire. Shrub taxon, distance to the nearest shrub and fire severity influenced the similarity between seedling and shrub fungal communities. Fungal composition was correlated with both foliar C:N ratio and seedling biomass and was one of the strongest explanatory variables predicting seedling biomass. While correlative, these results suggest that mycobionts are important to nutrient acquisition and biomass accrual of naturally establishing tree seedlings at treeline and that mycobiont taxa shared by resprouting postfire vegetation may be a significant source of inoculum for tree-seedling establishment beyond current treeline. {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Questions: How does the abundance and richness of plant assemblages with different functional (regeneration and nutrient acquisition) traits vary with fire regime, moisture availability and substrate fertility? What is the role of different functional traits in maintaining plant diversity under changing environmental conditions in seasonally dry and fire-prone environments? Location: Southwest Western Australia. Methods: Plant species abundance and soil nutrients were determined at 16 forest sites with variable fire histories across an aridity gradient. All plant species were classified based on their functional traits as (1) perennial or annual, (2) ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal, orchid mycorrhizal, proteoid or other non-mycorrhizal, (3) resprouters or seeder, and (4) nitrogen fixer or non-fixer. We used a multivariate (fourth-corner) technique to simultaneously test the significance and direction of the relationship between each of these traits and fire frequency, fire interval length, aridity, and soil N, P and C fractions. Results: The functional response of the vegetation to fire regime was minor and restricted to annual species, which comprised only $\sim$4% of taxa. Proteoid and ectomycorrhizal species dominated over species with arbuscular and orchid mycorrhizal roots, N-fixers dominated over non-fixers, and seeders dominated over resprouters when N fertility was low but organic labile P was high. Further, proteoid and ectomycorrhizal species richness increased with aridity, while arbuscular mycorrhizal species richness decreased. Conclusions: While the functional composition of southwest Australian vegetation is largely insensitive to changes in fire regime, nutrient acquisition and, to a lesser extent, regeneration traits provide mechanisms for the vegetation community to adjust to changes in resource availability. Thus, diversity responses to environmental change in seasonally dry and fire-prone ecosystems are likely to be primarily mediated by the composition of nutrient acquisition traits in the vegetation community. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the role of soil respiration in determining ecosystem carbon balance, and the conceptual basis for measuring and modeling soil respiration. We developed it to provide background and context for this special issue on soil respiration and to synthesize the presentations and discussions at the workshop. Soil respiration is the largest component of ecosystem respiration. Because autotrophic and heterotrophic activity belowground is controlled by substrate availability, soil respiration is strongly linked to plant metabolism, photosynthesis and litterfall. This link dominates both base rates and short-term fluctuations in soil respiration and suggests many roles for soil respiration as an indicator of ecosystem metabolism. However, the strong links between above and belowground processes complicate using soil respiration to understand changes in ecosystem carbon storage. Root and associated mycorrhizal respiration produce roughly half of soil respiration, with much of the remainder derived from decomposition of recently produced root and leaf litter. Changes in the carbon stored in the soil generally contribute little to soil respiration, but these changes, together with shifts in plant carbon allocation, determine ecosystem carbon storage belowground and its exchange with the atmosphere. Identifying the small signal from changes in large, slow carbon pools in flux dominated by decomposition of recent material and autotrophic and mycorrhizal respiration is a significant challenge. A mechanistic understanding of the belowground carbon cycle and of the response of different components to the environment will aid in identifying this signal. Our workshop identified information needs to help build that understanding: (1) the mechanisms that control the coupling of canopy and belowground processes; (2) the responses of root and heterotrophic respiration to environment; (3) plant carbon allocation patterns, particularly in different forest developmental stages, and in response to treatments (warming, CO2, nitrogen additions); and (4) coupling measurements of soil respiration with aboveground processes and changes in soil carbon. Multi-factor experiments need to be sufficiently long to allow the systems to adjust to the treatments. New technologies will be necessary to reduce uncertainty in estimates of carbon allocation, soil carbon pool sizes, and different responses of roots and microbes to environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

Here we propose a framework for considering how tree species and their mycorrhizal associates differentially couple carbon (C) and nutrient cycles in temperate forests. Given that tree species predominantly associate with a single type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi), and that the two types of fungi differ in their modes of nutrient acquisition, we hypothesize that the abundance of AM and ECM trees in a plot, stand, or region may provide an integrated index of biogeochemical transformations relevant to C cycling and nutrient retention. First, we describe how forest plots dominated by AM tree species have nutrient economies that differ in their C-nutrient couplings from those in plots dominated by ECM trees. Secondly, we demonstrate how the relative abundance of AM and ECM trees can be used to estimate nutrient dynamics across the landscape. Finally, we describe how our framework can be used to generate testable hypotheses about forest responses to global change factors, and how these dynamics can be used to develop better representations of plant-soil feedbacks and nutrient constraints on productivity in ecosystem and earth system models. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

In this study, we used ingrowth cores and stable C isotope analyses to quantify root- and mycelium-derived C sequestered in soil labile and recalcitrant C pools and their relative contributions to the decomposition of native SOC in a spruce-fir-dominated coniferous forest on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China. The results showed that new C sequestered in the soil labile C pool was primarily (77%) from mycelium-derived C, while 60% of the root-derived C sequestered in the soil was incorporated into the recalcitrant pool. Furthermore, although the total native SOC pool was not significantly influenced by new C derived from both roots and mycelia, mycelium-derived C induced a remarkably greater negative priming effect (−12.0%) on the native labile C pool than did root-derived C (−5.8%); in contrast, mycelium-derived C induced a greater positive priming effect (13.8%) than root-derived C (7.1%) on the native recalcitrant C pool. Collectively, our findings suggest that mycelium-derived C make a greater contribution to the newly sequestered C in the soil labile C pool than root-derived C, thereby inducing a remarkably greater positive priming effect on the decomposition of native soil recalcitrant C. Therefore, mycelium-derived C inputs may play a dominant role in soil C dynamics and long-term C storage, at least in alpine forest ecosystems where ectomycorrhizal mutualisms dominate. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {"Temperate" forests occur at the mid-latitudes, between 23.5 and 66.5° N and S, where they cover approximately 20 % of the available land area and are characterized by distinct seasonal climate cycles. Temperate forests are dominated by plants with a woody, treelike growth form, and they produce relatively closed canopies (60-100 % areal canopy coverage). Temperate forests occur across a broad range of climate zones, including those with moist, warm summers (e.g., deciduous forests in North America and Europe) and dry, cool summers (e.g., montane and subalpine forests in North America, South America, and Europe). Temperate forest ecosystems exhibit carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios that are higher (often >100-200) than other temperate-latitude ecosystems, due to Classic, historical concepts in ecology, such as "succession," have been developed from studies of temperate forest ecosystems. Forest succession refers to decadal-scale transitions in community composition. Each shift in community composition causes changes in the forest microenvironment, which in turn causes further changes in community composition. Traditionally, this pattern of progressive change in community composition and associated feedbacks to forest microenvironment was viewed within a highly deterministic framework. More recently, ecological concepts, such as "gap theory," have emerged from the older concepts of succession and have been developed with greater emphasis on stochasticity. Both succession and gap theory has contributed greatly to our understanding of the causes of natural and anthropogenic changes to the species composition of temperate forest ecosystems. Nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P) are cycled through temperate forest ecosystems through a process of coupled recycling involving serial relationships between plants and soil microorganisms. N or P that is deposited to the soil through litter production is transformed from organic to inorganic forms through microbial mineralization, producing nitrate and phosphate ions, which can then be re-assimilated by plants and used to construct new organic biomass. Leaching of phosphate and nitrate from forest soils (especially nitrate in temperate forests) prior to re-assimilation by plants represents an important nutrient loss process and often limits forest biomass production. Root-fungal symbioses, called mycorrhizae, are well developed in temperate forest ecosystems. The hyphal biomass from the fungus radiates from associated roots and increases the capacity for trees to capture nitrate and phosphate prior to leaching and, in some cases, allows trees to take up organic nitrogen (such as small proteins or single molecules of amino acids). The acquisition of organic forms of nitrogen (and to some extent phosphorus) "short-circuits" the conventional form of biogeochemical cycles (alternating between plants and microbes) and increases the efficiency of nutrient retention in the ecosystem. Most water that is cycled through forests is used to sustain a favorable energy balance. Evapotranspiration from forests facilitates the loss of heat that is absorbed as net radiation (from the sun and sky) and returns water to the atmosphere, thus sustaining the terrestrial water cycle. Trees in temperate forests (especially in North America and Europe) have been exposed to increasing physiological stress in recent decades due to the increased frequency of drought and high temperatures. These stresses have the potential to reduce forest growth and may be responsible for the observed weakening of forest carbon sinks globally. Climate-induced stress, in turn, exposes temperate forests to an increased frequency of epidemic insect outbreaks and associated high rates of herbivory, as well as shorter fire return cycles. The combination of abiotic and biotic stress is likely responsible for an increase in observed mass tree mortality in temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere. Greater frequencies of alternations between years with extreme climates (e.g., wetter-than-average years followed by drier-than-average years) have the potential to convert less damaging surface fires into more damaging crown fires due to the buildup of beneath-canopy fuels and greater connectivity of lower-elevation grasslands that border higher-elevation forests, during wet years, followed by greater ignition potential during dry years. Given changes in the Earth's climate system that increase the threat to fire-and insect-induced mass tree mortality in temperate forests, effective management of these ecosystems has become even more urgent and important to responsible stewardship of our natural resources. Future management efforts should be designed on a solid foundation of scientific knowledge about forest succession, forest biogeochemistry, and the natural relations of forests to fire return cycles and cycles of higher and lower levels of insect herbivory. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.},

abstract = {The effects of a prescribed fire on the presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi on the root tips of ponderosa pine were investigated one year after a prescribed ground fire. Ectomycorrhizas were sampled within 1 m2 plots before and one year after the fire, and in nearby control plots that were not burned. The cores were divided into litter/organic, upper mineral, and lower mineral layers. The total ectomycorrhizal biomass in the control plots did not differ between year one and year two samples for any core layer, while in the fire plots the destruction of the litter/organic layer resulted in an eight-fold reduction in total ectomycorrhizal biomass. Mycorrhizal biomass in the two mineral layers was not significantly reduced by the fire. We used molecular tools to identify fungi directly from the ectomycorrhizas. In unburned plots members of the Russulaceae and Thelephoraceae were among the most frequent and abundant ectomycorrhizal types; species of most other taxa were rare. In the control plots these two families were among the dominant species in both years, but patchiness on a fine spatio-temporal scale caused some major changes in ranking of individual species between sample years. Rhizopogon subcaerulescens was the most pronounced example; its biomass in the control plot samples was seven times greater in year two than in year one because of an exceptionally large duster of mycorrhizas encountered in a single core. The effect of fire on individual species was difficult to assess because of this patchiness and because all species were low in abundance after the fire. The most abundant pre-fire species were reduced to undetectable post-fire levels, while several less abundant species, including R. subcaerulescens, Cenococcum geophilum, and several unknown types were not substantially reduced by the fire. We speculate that the more abundant species, Mariellia sp., thelephoroid 1, and Tomentella sublilacina, were differentially affected because their dominance was most prominent at the litter and organic layers. In any case, a short-term effect of this fire appears to be increased species evenness.},

abstract = {Humans have altered the global nitrogen (N) cycle, greatly increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition in industrialized regions of the world. Groundcover plants can be sensitive indicators of nitrogen deposition impacts. Here, we report results from repeated measurements over a 7year period of groundcover (plants<1.4m tall) and understory (plants with a diameter<5cm at 1.4m in height) vegetation in four mature northern hardwood forests in the north-central United States receiving experimental additions of N (3gm-2year-1 as NaNO3 for 18years). Experimental N deposition reduced the average abundance of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) seedlings in the groundcover by>50% (P<0.001). This reduction occurred at all four sites, but was only statistically significant at the two sites where these seedlings were most abundant (site×nitrogen: P<0.001). Our observations of mortality within a large cohort of sugar maple seedlings across three sites provide further evidence of this effect. For these seedlings, experimental N deposition significantly (P<0.05) increased mortality in the weeks following germination, as well as over the longer term, reducing overall survival after 5years by almost 90%. Although groundcover plants accounted for<0.5% of aboveground plant biomass, they contributed up to 10% of ecosystem leaf area and 5% of aboveground litter. At the two sites where sugar maple seedlings were infrequent, understory vegetation was more abundant and dominated by hop-hornbeam (Ostrya virginiana (Miller) K. Koch; 42% of all stems). At these two sites, experimental N deposition significantly reduced the abundance of understory hop-hornbeam by more than 75% (site×nitrogen: P=0.008). The effects of experimental N deposition on the understory and groundcover vegetation occurred without significant decreases in reproductive litter or increases in canopy leaf area. Instead, the negative effects are more likely a by-product of other documented changes caused by the experimental N deposition: increased forest floor mass, decreased mycorrhizal abundance, and increased production of potentially alleopathic phenolic compounds. Because the late-successional species in these forests rely upon groundcover and understory plants for regeneration, the effects of added N on this vegetation have potential implications for future forest composition, particularly given the likely loss of some species in these forests due to exotic pests and pathogens. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Testate amoebae (TA) are an important part of soil microbial communities and in certain ecosystems they may represent a substantial proportion of total microbial biomass. Their distribution and abundance is driven by various abiotic factors (e.g., pH, organic matter, soil moisture, soil/water chemistry) but comparatively less is known about the role of biotic interactions. TA often co-occur with Ericaceae, a ubiquitous plant family inhabiting acidic soils with poor nutrient status. Ericaceae can significantly change soil properties through production of recalcitrant litter and possibly also due to root exudates and activities of root-inhabiting fungi; this may result in profound modifications of microbial communities. A recent study from northwest England showed that the invasive ericaceous shrub Rhododendron ponticum may significantly modify communities of soil TA. Here, we investigate the effect of pH, organic matter, and R. ponticum presence on TA communities within the native range of the ericaceous shrub at two sites in southern Spain and compare our results with the previous study from NW England. At the Spanish sites, organic matter content, R. ponticum presence and pH affected occurrence and abundance of several TA species; R. ponticum presence and organic matter content were highly correlated and explained most of the observed variability in TA communities (i.e. the effect of the R. ponticum rhizosphere). R. ponticum rhizosphere affected especially TA with relatively large tests, i.e., Cyclopyxis eurystoma, Phryganella acropodia and Trigonopyxis arcula. Interestingly, T. arcula was also positively associated with R. ponticum in the previously studied British sites. The rhizosphere of the ericaceous shrub appears to have a positive effect on testate amoebae taxon richness at the two studied autochthonous Spanish sites but may reduce taxon richness in the sites in Britain where R. ponticum is an introduced species. Such possible positive/negative effects of native/invasive species, as well as other plant guilds, on TA communities clearly deserve further investigation.},

abstract = {Aboveground species richness patterns of vascular plants, aphyllophoroid macrofungi, bryophytes and lichens were compared along an altitudinal gradient (80–310 m a.s.l.) on the Slantsevaya mountain at the eastern macroslope of the Polar Urals (Russia). Five altitudinal levels were included in the study: (1) Northern boreal forest with larch-spruce in the Sob' river valley habitats; (2–3) two levels of closed, northern boreal, larch-dominated forests on the slopes; (4) crook-stemmed forest; (5) tundra habitats above the timberline. Vascular plant or bryophyte species richness was not affected by altitudinal levels, but lichen species richness significantly increased from the river valley to the tundra. For aphyllophoroid macrofungi, species richness was highest at intermediate and low altitudes, and poorest in the tundra. These results indicate a positive ecotone effect on aphyllophoroid fungal species richness. The species richness of aphyllophoroid fungi as a whole was neither correlated to mortmass stocks, nor to species richness of vascular plants, but individual ecological or morphological groups depended on these parameters. Poroid fungal species richness was positively correlated to tree age, wood biomass and crown density, and therefore peaked in the middle of the slope and at the foot of the mountain. In contrast, clavarioid fungal species richness was negatively related to woody bio-and mortmass, and therefore peaked in the tundra. This altitudinal level was characterized by high biomass proportions of lichens and mosses, and by high litter mortmass. The proportion of corticoid fungi increased with altitude, reaching its maximum at the timberline. Results from the different methods used in this work were concordant, and showed significant patterns. Tundra communities differ significantly from the forest communities, as is also confirmed by nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses based on the spectrum of morphological and ecological groups of aphyllophoroid fungi. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

The measured soil respiration fluxes were quite stable and somewhat larger compared with those reported in literature. The experiment took place during the shoot elongation period with intensive nutrient uptake, and it might be that soil respiration was dominated by mycorrhizal activity.

abstract = {The effects of logging on forest ecosystems are severe and long-lasting. In addition, these effects are often paralleled with shifts in soil fungal community composition and functional guilds with potential feedbacks on ecosystem functioning. Clarifying how soil fungal communities are linked to the effects of historical logging could help us better understand the ecological consequences of logging. Here, we collected soils from 61 25 m × 25 m quadrats across a 160-km2 tropical rainforest in Hainan Island, China, which had been partially clear cut or selectively harvested and left to recover for up to 50 years. Soil fungal community composition and species co-variation networks were investigated in the selectively harvested (select cut) and clear cut forest stands and were compared to data from the primary stands without a history of logging. Historical logging shifted fungal community composition from Zygomycota towards Basidiomycota domination mainly through modifying vegetation composition and soil properties. The relative abundance of root associated fungi (i.e., ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal), animal pathogens and wood saprotrophs increased 50 years after logging, while the relative abundance of undefined saprotrophs decreased. In select cut stands, the fungal community was better organized with higher numbers of functionally interrelated operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and more generalist OTUs. In contrast, the number of functionally interrelated OTUs was lowest in the fungal network in clear cut stands. By comparing the topological roles of the shared OTUs among the three types of forest stands, we found role-shifts among fungal members from the specialists in the primary stands to the generalists in the select cut stands. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the major phyla involved in the role-shifts. Moreover, the fungal network in primary stands was positively associated with litter nutrients, while that in select cut stands was positively related to soil nutrients content. This indicated that the major drivers of fungal community organization shifted from litter nutrients content in the primary forest towards soil nutrients content in the selectively harvested forest. In the clear cut stands, however, the associations between fungal network and both litter and soil nutrients content decreased when compared with those in the primary and select cut stands. More than 60% of the total links among fungal members in clear cut stands were negative, implying a trend of niche partitioning among fungal groups with a half-century recovery after clearcutting in the tropical rainforest. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Forests globally are facing an increasing number of threats from modified disturbance regimes, novel stressors and changing environmental conditions. This has ultimately resulted in declines in the ecological condition of many forest and woodland ecosystems, leading to widespread tree mortality and stand dieback. Effective indicators of overall woodland ecological condition are therefore needed for environmental monitoring and to support management responses. To test the effectiveness of different variables that could potentially be used as indicators of woodland condition, 102 variables that describe woodland structure, composition, functioning, edaphic conditions and disturbance regimes were assessed along 12 replicate gradients of beech stand dieback. Results indicated that 35 variables differed significantly between at least two stages of the dieback gradient, indicating their sensitivity to stand dieback. Seven of these indicators related to woodland species composition, two to functional processes, 20 to structural features, four to edaphic conditions, and two to disturbance regimes. These results demonstrate that effective indicators can potentially be identified for each of the ecological categories. Effective composition indicators included species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi, ground flora and epiphytic lichens; functional indicators were soil respiration rate and net nitrification rate; edaphic conditions included soil Na:Ca ratio, exchangeable sodium, total carbon, Ca:Al ratio; structural indicators included canopy openness, litter cover, sward height, and volume of deadwood, and for disturbance the indicator was Equus dung density. Other measures, such as shrub cover and species richness of carabid beetles and spiders, were not found to vary significantly along the dieback gradients, and were therefore not identified as effective indicators. These results demonstrate the value of gradient analysis for evaluating indicators of woodland condition, but also highlight the need for multi-site studies to identify indicators with widescale applicability. {\textcopyright} 2019},

abstract = {Forest soil organic matter (SOM) is an important dynamic store of C and N, which releases plant available N and the greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O. Early stages of decomposition of recent plant litters are better known than the formation of older and more stable soil pools of N and C, in which case classic theory stated that selective preservation of more resistant plant compounds was important. Recent insights heighten that all plant matter becomes degraded and that older SOM consists of compounds proximally of microbial origin. It has been proposed that in boreal forests, ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF), symbionts of trees, are actively involved in the formation of slowly-degrading SOM. We characterized SOM in the mor-layer along a local soil N supply gradient in a boreal forest, a gradient with large variations in chemical and biological characteristics, notably a decline in the biomass of ECMF in response to increasing soil N supply. We found contrasting and regular patterns in carbohydrates, lignin, aromatic carbon, and in N-containing compounds estimated by solid-state 13C and 15N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These occurred along with parallel changes in the natural abundances of the stable isotopes 13C and 15N in both bulk SOM and extracted fractions of the SOM. The modelled “bomb-14C″ age of the lower layers studied ranged between 15 years at the N-poor end, to 70 years at the N-rich end of the gradient. On average half the increase in $\delta$13C with soil depth (and hence age) of the mor-layer can be attributed to soil processes and the other half to changes in the isotopic composition of the plant C inputs. There was a decrease in carbohydrates (O-alkyl C) with increasing depth. This supports the classical hypothesis of declining availability of easily decomposable substrates to microorganisms with increasing soil depth and age. The observed increase in $\delta$13C with depth, however, speaks against the idea of selective preservation of more resistant plant compounds like lignin. Furthermore, from the N-poor to the N-rich end the difference between 15N in plant litter N and N in the deeper part of the mor-layer, the H-layer, decreased in parallel with a decline in ECMF. The latter provides evidence that the role of ECMF as major sink for N diminishes, and hence their potential role in SOM stabilization, when the soil N supply increases. At the N-rich end, where bacteria dominate over fungi, other agents than ECMF must be involved in the large build-up of the H-layer with the slowest turnover rate found along the gradient. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors},

abstract = {Mycoheterotrophic orchids have adapted to shaded forest understory by shifting to achlorophylly and receiving carbon from their mycorrhizal fungi. In temperate forests, they associate in a highly specific way with fungi forming ectomycorrhizas on nearby trees, and exploiting tree photosynthates. However, many rainforests lack ectomycorrhizal fungi, and there is evidence that some tropical Asiatic species associate with saprotrophic fungi. To investigate this in different geographic and phylogenetic contexts, we identified the mycorrhizal fungi supporting two tropical mycoheterotrophic orchids from Mascarene (Indian Ocean) and Caribbean islands. We tested their possible carbon sources by measuring natural nitrogen (15N) and carbon (13C) abundances. Saprotrophic basidiomycetes were found: Gastrodia similis associates with a wood-decaying Resinicium (Hymenochaetales); Wullschlaegelia aphylla associates with both litter-decaying Gymnopus and Mycena species, whose rhizomorphs link orchid roots to leaf litter. The 15N and 13C abundances make plausible food chains from dead wood to G. similis and from dead leaves to W. aphylla. We propose that temperature and moisture in rainforests, but not in most temperate forests, may favour sufficient saprotrophic activity to support development of mycoheterotrophs. By enlarging the spectrum of mycorrhizal fungi and the level of specificity in mycoheterotrophic orchids, this study provides new insights on orchid and mycorrhizal biology in the tropics. {\textcopyright} 2009 New Phytologist.},

abstract = {In this study we show that the natural abundance of the nitrogen isotope 15, $\delta$15N, of plants in heath tundra and at the tundra-forest ecocline is closely correlated with the presence and type of mycorrhizal association in the plant roots. A total of 56 vascular plant species, 7 moss species, 2 lichens and 6 species of fungi from four heath and forest tundra sites in Greenland, Siberia and Sweden were analysed for $\delta$15N and N concentration. Roots of vascular plants were examined for mycorrhizal colonization, and the soil organic matter was analysed for $\delta$15N, N concentration and soil inorganic, dissolved organic and microbial N. No arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonizations were found although potential host plants were present in all sites. The dominant species were either ectomycorrhizal (ECM) or ericoid mycorrhizal (ERI). The $\delta$15N of ECM or ERI plants was 3.5-7.7 ‰ lower than that of non-mycorrhizal (NON) species in three of the four sites. This corresponds to the results in our earlier study of mycorrhiza and plant $\delta$15N which was limited to one heath and one fellfield in N Sweden. Hence, our data suggest that the $\delta$15N pattern: NON/AM plants > ECM plants ≤ ERI plants is a general phenomenon in ecosystems with nutrient-deficient organogenic soils. In the fourth site, a birch forest with a lush herb/shrub understorey, the differences between functional groups were considerably smaller, and only the ERI species differed (by 1.1‰) from the NON species. Plants of all functional groups from this site had nearly twice the leaf N concentration as that found in the same species at the other three sites. It is likely that low inorganic N availability is a prerequisite for strong $\delta$15N separation among functional groups. Both ECM roots and fruitbodies were 15N enriched compared to leaves which suggests that the difference in $\delta$15N between plants with different kinds of mycorrhiza could be due to isotopic fractionation at the fungal-plant interface. However, differences in $\delta$15N between soil N forms absorbed by the plants could also contribute to the wide differences in plant $\delta$15N found in most heath and forest tundra ecosystems. We hypothesize that during microbial immobilization of soil ammonium the microbial N pool could become 15N-depleted and the remaining, plant-available soil ammonium 15N-enriched. The latter could be a main source of N for NON/AM plants which usually have high $\delta$15N. In contrast, amino acids and other soil organic N compounds presumably are 15N-depleted, similar to plant litter, and ECM and ERI plants with high uptake of these N forms hence have low leaf $\delta$15N. Further indications come from the $\delta$15N of mosses and lichens which was similar to that of ECM plants. Tundra cryptogams (and ECM and ERI plants) have previously been shown to have higher uptake of amino acid than ammonium N; their low $\delta$15N might therefore reflect the $\delta$15N of free amino acids in the soil. The concentration of dissolved organic N was 3-16 times higher than that of inorganic N in the sites. Organic nitrogen could be an important N source for ECM and, in particular, ERI plants in heath and forest tundra ecosystems with low release rate of inorganic N from the soil organic matter.},

abstract = {Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has enhanced soil carbon (C) stocks in temperate forests. Most research has posited that these soil C gains are driven primarily by shifts in fungal community composition with elevated N leading to declines in lignin degrading Basidiomycetes. Recent research, however, suggests that plants and soil microbes are dynamically intertwined, whereby plants send C subsidies to rhizosphere microbes to enhance enzyme production and the mobilization of N. Thus, under elevated N, trees may reduce belowground C allocation leading to cascading impacts on the ability of microbes to degrade soil organic matter through a shift in microbial species and/or a change in plant–microbe interactions. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which couplings among plant, fungal, and bacterial responses to N fertilization alter the activity of enzymes that are the primary agents of soil decomposition. We measured fungal and bacterial community composition, root–microbial interactions, and extracellular enzyme activity in the rhizosphere, bulk, and organic horizon of soils sampled from a long-term (>25 years), whole-watershed, N fertilization experiment at the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA. We observed significant declines in plant C investment to fine root biomass (24.7%), root morphology, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization (55.9%). Moreover, we found that declines in extracellular enzyme activity were significantly correlated with a shift in bacterial community composition, but not fungal community composition. This bacterial community shift was also correlated with reduced AM fungal colonization indicating that declines in plant investment belowground drive the response of bacterial community structure and function to N fertilization. Collectively, we find that enzyme activity responses to N fertilization are not solely driven by fungi, but instead reflect a whole ecosystem response, whereby declines in the strength of belowground C investment to gain N cascade through the soil environment. {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Saprotrophic fungi are one of the primary groups of organisms responsible for decomposition and nutrient cycling processes. Aside from their direct effects on litter decomposition, these organisms may indirectly affect litter invertebrate activity via fungal-mediated conditioning (i.e. 'priming') of litter substrates. While this priming effect is generally assumed to take place, this assumption is based on correlative observations and feeding preference trials rather than experimental discrimination of the mechanisms driving the process. We used a microcosm experiment of brown-rot (Fistulina hepatica, Fomitopsis lilacinogilva) and white-rot (Pycnoporus coccineus) fungi on two sclerophyllous leaf litters (Eucalyptus loxophleba and Acacia acuminata) to test if a fungal-mediated change in plant litter increased the nutritive value of the food source, and if a change in cell-wall (structural) compounds reduced the toughness of leaves, resulting in increased feeding activity by invertebrates. Brown- and white-rot fungal colonization had significant and diverse effects on the total nutrient concentrations and proportions of cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose of the leaf litter-fungi complex. However, significant decreases in leaf toughness and increases in mass loss and leaf fragmentation associated with detritivorous millipede (Ommatoiulus moreletii) activity only occurred in white-rot primed microcosms relative to the control. The mechanisms by which the white-rot fungus affected both leaf toughness and millipede feeding activity differed between leaf litters. In E. loxophleba microcosms, reduced leaf toughness and increased millipede grazing were mediated by relative changes in litter inorganic chemistry, rather than structural compounds, whereas in A. acuminata microcosms the effects of fungal priming were not mediated by either. These results suggest that, in the early stages of decomposition, fungal priming effects on leaf litter nutrients are a more important determinant of litter-invertebrate interactions than changes to litter structural compounds. Furthermore, different species of fungi interact with different litter types and invertebrates in functionally different ways. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Boreal forest floor is covered with ericoid plants and in soil, ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal plant roots and fungal hyphae are intermixed. How different mycorrhizal plants affect N mobilization from soil organic matter (SOM) has yet to be elucidated. Here we compared the effects of ericoid plants (Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis-idaea), forming ericoid mycorrhiza (ERM), on soil N chemistry, plant N uptake and SOM decomposition and compared them with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) Pinus sylvestris in a microcosm experiment. Pine and ericoid plants affected soil N similarly, accessing both degradable and recalcitrant N pools. Both ericoid plants and pine took up N from organic source. Ericoid plant roots contained more phenolic compounds and condensed tannins than pine roots which together with lower pH under ericoids suggests substantial changes in soil chemistry and biology. This study underlines the plant stimulation of SOM degradation with special emphasis on ericoid plants. We point out that both ericoid and ectomycorrhizal plants and their interactions should be of interest when N uptake and SOM decomposition in boreal forests are studied. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Epipogium aphyllum is a rare Eurasian achlorophyllous forest orchid known to associate with fungi that form ectomycorrhizas, while closely related orchids of warm humid climates depend on wood- or litter-decomposer fungi. We conducted 13C and 15N stable isotope natural abundance analyses to identify the organic nutrient source of E. aphyllum from Central Norway. These data for orchid shoot tissues, in comparison to accompanying autotrophic plants, document C and N flow from ectomycorrhizal fungi to the orchid. DNA data from fungal pelotons in the orchid root cortex confirm the presence of Inocybe and Hebeloma, which are both fungi that form ectomycorrhizas. The enrichment factors for 13C and 15N of E. aphyllum are used to calculate a new overall average enrichment factor for mycoheterotrophic plants living in association with ectomycorrhizal fungi ($\epsilon$13C±1SD of 7.2±1.6‰ and $\epsilon$15N±1SD of 12.8±3.9‰). These can be used to estimate the fungal contribution to organic nutrient uptake by partially mycoheterotrophic plants where fully mycoheterotrophic plants are lacking. N concentrations in orchid tissue were unusually high and significantly higher than in accompanying autotrophic leaf samples. This may be caused by N gain of E. aphyllum from obligate ectomycorrhizal fungi. We show that E. aphyllum is an epiparasitic mycoheterotrophic orchid that depends on ectomycorrhizal Inocybe and Hebeloma to obtain C and N through a tripartite system linking mycoheterotrophic plants through fungi with forest trees. {\textcopyright} 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.},

Litter bags containing either pine needles, oak leaves or oak+pine mix were placed within the O horizon of a lowland pitch pine (Pinus rigida) forest in the New Jersey Pinelands. Upon retrieval, ingrown pine roots were removed and quantified for total length and percent ectomycorrhizal colonization by morphotype. Phosphatase activity was determined for dominant morphotypes. In addition, litter decay rates and N and P litter content were measured. Mixed litter (oak+pine) had highest total pine root ingrowth. Dominant ectomycorrhizal morphotypes differed in response to litter type. A tuberculate form dominated (35%) in pine litters while distinctly different nontuberculate morphotypes dominated in oak and mixed litters. High phosphatase activity of morphotypes was correlated with high phosphorus immobilization during oak leaf decay. Results indicate that a mix of forest litters (oak and pine) optimizes retention of scarce nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The diverse chemical environment of these different litter types induces different ectomycorrhizal community development which show functional differences in the way phosphorus is likely to be cycled. The influence of litter type on diversity and function of ectomycorhizae is an important step in identifying linkages between biodiversity of this group and ecosystem functions.},

Thus, the dynamics of fine-root production, morphological traits and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) infection intensity were assessed monthly over 1 y in the grassland, scrub, secondary and mature forests of the Atlantic Forest ecosystem, amounting to 13 consecutive samplings. Fine roots were sampled in three 100 × 100-m plots at each study site. Each plot was subdivided in five 20 × 100-m subplots and 15 soil samples were randomly taken from a depth of 0-5 cm in soil within each plot. The average of the fine-root dry mass increased from 1.39 mg cm-3 soil in the grassland to 3.37 mg cm-3 in the secondary forest; fine-root tip diameter varied from 146 $\mu$m in the grassland to 303 $\mu$m in the mature forest; tissue density from 0.24 g cm-3 root in the grassland to 0.30 g cm-3 in the mature forest and fine-root length was 4.52 cm cm -3 soil in the grassland and 6.48 cm cm-3 soil in the secondary forest. On the other hand, fine-root specific length decreased from 43.9 m g-1 root to 18.3 m g-1 root in the mature forest; incidence of root hairs was 67% in the grassland and 30% in the mature forest; the length of root hairs was 215 $\mu$m in the grassland and 112 $\mu$m in the mature forest; and the intensity of AMF infection decreased from 66% in the grassland to 17% in the mature forest. In addition to AMF infection, the environmental variation also affected dry mass production and morphological traits of fine roots. During the cool season, fine-root dry mass, fine-root length, incidence and length of root hairs and intensity of AMF infection decreased compared with the warm season. We verified that the potential for soil exploration, that expresses the capacity for nutrient acquisition via fine roots and AMF infection intensity, decreased during the cool season and with the advance of the successional groups. These results indicate that fine-root traits and intensity of AMF infection are influenced by the intrinsic nutrient requirements of the plant species in each ecological group. {\textcopyright} 2014 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Atmospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition rates are predicted to drastically increase in the coming decades. The ecosystem level consequences of these increases will depend on how plant tissue nutrient concentrations, stoichiometry and investment in nutrient uptake mechanisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) change in response to increased nutrient availability, and how responses differ between plant functional types. Using a factorial nutrient addition experiment with seedlings of multiple N-fixing and non-N-fixing tree species, we examined whether leaf chemistry and AMF responses differ between these dominant woody plant functional groups of tropical savanna and dry forest ecosystems. We found that N-fixers have remarkably stable foliar chemistry that stays constant with external input of nutrients. Non-N-fixers responded to N and N + P addition by increasing both concentrations and total amounts of foliar N, but showed a corresponding decrease in P concentrations while total amounts of foliar P stayed constant, suggesting a ‘dilution' of tissue P with increased N availability. Non-N-fixers also showed an increase in N:P ratios with N and N + P addition, probably driven by both an increase in N and a decrease in P concentrations. AMF colonization decreased with N + P addition in non-N-fixers and increased with N and N + P addition in N-fixers, suggesting differences in their nutrient acquisition roles in the two plant functional groups. Our results suggest that N-fixers and non-N-fixers can differ significantly in their responses to N and P deposition, with potential consequences for future nutrient and carbon cycling in savanna and dry forest ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

After incubation, needles were extracted with NaOH and extracts were analysed using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Needle decomposition was determined based on the decrease in C:N ratio. Systems inoculated with the basidiomycete S. androsaceus revealed substantial decrease in C:N ratio (from 25.8 to 11.3) while the effect of ascomycetes on the C:N ratio was negligible. We suppose that tested strains of saprotrophic ascomycetes did not participate substantially in litter decomposition, but were directly involved in phosphorus transformation and together with S. androsaceus could transform orthophosphate monoesters and diesters from spruce litter needles into diphosphates, polyphosphates and phosphonates. These transformations seem to be typical for saprotrophic fungi involved in litter needle decomposition, although the proportion of individual phosphorus forms differed among studied fungal strains. Phosphonate presence in needles after fungal inoculation is of special interest because no previous investigation recorded phosphonate synthesis and accumulation by fungi. Our results confirmed that the 31P NMR spectroscopy is an excellent instrumental method for studying transformations of soil organic phosphorus during plant litter decomposition.

abstract = {We analyzed the dynamics of the short-term incorporation of recently fixed carbon into the below-ground food web in a boreal forest. Five young spruce trees (Picea abies) were pulse-labeled with 13CO2 and the isotopic label was traced in soil invertebrates during 5 weeks. The freshly fixed plant carbon quickly entered both litter-located and soil-located compartments of the detrital food web. Among invertebrates inhabiting the mineral soil layers, a trophic link to the root-derived C was most pronounced in species with higher $\delta$15N values, suggesting this energy source to be more important in deeper mineral soil horizons. The label appeared faster in saprophagous animals than in predators (the median time lag after labeling was 6 and 12 days, respectively), but the difference was not significant. The label was recovered in 15 of 38 species of saprophagous animals and in 20 of 63 species of predators. Among saprophages, the frequency and intensity of the label was relatively high in endogeic collembolans and in bibionid larvae, but earthworms and enchytraeids were not labeled. Several groups of predators, lithobiid centipedes in particular, quickly acquired the root-derived carbon, possibly indicating the feeding on live roots or mycorrhizal mycelium. In total, only 35 % of species or genera examined acquired the label. This suggests that majority of invertebrate taxa in the decomposer food web are unlikely to depend heavily on freshly fixed plant carbon provided by roots and root-associated microorganisms. {\textcopyright} 2016, The Ecological Society of Japan.},

The work reviewed in this communication demonstrates how and why field mycology might provide a further tool towards the investigation of scenes of crime concealed in forest ecosystems.

abstract = {Edible forest mushrooms are one of the most important non-wood products
and their economic importance is constantly growing. Only in Poland, the
value of collected mushroom is estimated to about 740 million PLN a
year. Such species as Boletus sp., Lactarius sp. or Tuber sp. are the
most valuable non-wood forest products. Wild species, a great part of
which are ectomycorrhizal fungi, not only play a key role in the growth
and development of forest trees, but also belong to the most used in the
Polish cuisine. A new challenge is to develop a scientific basis for the
production of edible ectomycorrhizal fungi. Given the fact that
fructification of fungi is influenced by many environmental, ecological,
orographic and anthropogenic factors, their growing is rather a tough
task. So far, methods of fungi growing have been developed in case of
several species and they are still to be implemented on an economic
scale. Under natural conditions, both mycorrhizal and fruiting processes
may be stimulated by proper silviculture treatments, which are conducive
to wood and mushrooms production as well. Nowadays, the concept of
`mycosilviculture' is gaining more and more interest. In order to
implement it, the knowledge of the biology of fungi and their
host-species is needed. In this article, a rich body of studies dealing
with the influence of management methods on fruitification of fungi is
reviewed. The critical factor that appears is the proper regulation of
tree density by appropriate severity of thinnings and regeneration cuts
in order to meet the requirements of targeted fungi. The other kinds of
treatments, such as removal of the herb cover, litter and upper soil
level also affect fungi fructification. The effect of these treatments
may vary for different species. The knowledge of wild mushroom
production, forest management and climate changes still requires
long-term and multidimensional research in a broad spectrum of tree
stands and forest habitats.},

abstract = {Dalbergia sissoo, an important tree of tropical regions, is grown as monoculture or in agroforesty systems because of the quality of its wood and its effects on soil fertility through N2 fixation. Low soil fertility in tropical regions results in poor plant growth. This is significant in the case of forest trees, since they are generally transplanted without considering the fertility status of soil. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (a plant-growth promoting fungus through higher nutrient uptake), Rhizobium leguminosarum strain DSP2 (a N2 fixer) and Pseudomonas fluorescens strain GRPr (a plant-growth promoting bacterium), on the growth and nutrient acquisition of Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. Mollisol and Entisol were used to compare the effects of different soils. A tetrapartite interaction of AMF, P. fluorescens strain GRPr, R. leguminosarum strain DSP2 and D. sissoo showed improved plant growth response in the Entisol compared to uninoculated plants. The interaction of AMF with DSP2 was found; however, AMF did not show the same growth responses in combination with either GRPr or DSP2 and GRPr regardless of soil type. AMF and GRPr showed decreased plant growth, suggesting that enhanced plant growth was dependent on the bacteria - AMF combination used. We suggest that, in the case of D. sissoo, choice and testing of the combination of beneficial organisms is necessary to get desired plant growth promotion. {\textcopyright} International Society for Tropical Ecology.},

abstract = {Restoration ecology is the study of renewing a degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystem through active human intervention. Restoration ecology specifically refers to the scientific study that has evolved as recently. It assumes that environmental degradation and population decline are somewhat reversible processes. Ecological restoration has the potential to improve air quality, reverse forest clearance and desertification, slow biodiversity loss, enhance urban environments, and perhaps improve human livelihoods, and humanity's relationships within nature. Recent conceptual advances highlight the interactions between flora, fauna, and soil in restoration ecology. The recovery process is relatively longer in comparison to the time taken for degradation. Restoration might take place naturally but that is a very slow process. Restoration ecology initiates and speeds up the recovery process. Bioremediation is the use of organisms (prokaryotes, fungi, plant, etc.) to detoxify polluted ecosystems by accumulating the toxic components in their bodies. Microbes may play a vital role in supplying nutrients in utilizable forms from soil to the plants. The important functions of the microbes are in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, and plant growth hormone synthesis, which are essential for better colonization of mangroves, etc. Recognizing the importance of soil microbes for success of higher plants and overall ecosystem health is the key to success of restoration. Plants with nitrogen-fixing symbioses have been employed throughout the history of restoration. Mycorrhizal associations have also been long explored in restoration settings, where their benefits have been repeatedly demonstrated, although the necessity of active mycorrhizal introduction is still required. Soil microbes help in mineralization of organic substrates form litter and release nutrients as a result of the heterotrophic activity. Hence, the microbial biomass is an important factor for maintaining soil quality, nutrient cycling, and soil reclamation. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Although replanting broad-leaved trees in coniferous forest has been proven to increase stand soil quality, it is unclear how this prevalent forest management regime affects the soil fungal communities of individual conifers in mixed forest. Herein, we chose two representative coniferous tree species (Pinus massoniana and Pinus elliottii) and employed high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR to investigate fungal community composition and function in rhizosphere soils under monoculture and in mixed forests (replanted with Schima superba for 13 years) in subtropical China. Mixing with broad-leaved trees resulted in increased rhizosphere soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient (total nitrogen, NH4+ and available phosphorus). Rhizosphere soil fungal abundance (ITS gene copy numbers) and community diversity of conifers were increased after mixing. Meanwhile, the soil fungal abundance and ACE richness index in Masson pine were higher compared with slash pine whether in monoculture or mixed forests. Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota and Glomeromycota were the dominant phyla in soils. Mixing with broad-leaved trees decreased the relative abundance of Ascomycota, while it increased Basidiomycota and Glomeromycota in the rhizosphere soil of conifers. Moreover, there was a decrease in the relative abundance of animal pathogens and wood saprotrophic fungi, while soil saprotrophic fungi, ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were increased in rhizosphere soil of conifers after mixing, suggesting changes from saprotrophic fungi to symbiotrophic fungi to increase soil nutrient supply and enhance tree nutrient uptake. Principal coordinates analysis showed that the fungal communities in mixed forests clustered closely and were separated from monoculture forests. Fungal community composition and function were mainly dependent on SOC. Our results indicate that mixing with broad-leaved trees increases fungal abundance, alters fungal community composition and function and thus potentially contributes to soil quality improvement and tree nutrient acquisition of conifers. Masson pine is more adaptable than slash pine to establish mixed forest in subtropical China. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal fungi exhibit high diversity even in small monoculture forests. Roughly 20 to 35 species typically occupy such sites. Explanations for this diversity can be based on resource partitioning, disturbance, competition, or interaction with other organisms. Mycorrhizal fungi compete for two general classes of resources: host-derived carbon and soil or detritus derived mineral nutrients. Both types of resources are arrayed in space (e.g., soil depth, distance from tree) and time (e.g., season, host successional series). Some species seem to be partitioned in space and time at these scales, but the question of how widespread these patterns are remains largely unanswered. Mineral resources are distributed in discrete substrates in soil, litter, and within other soil microorganisms; the biochemical diversity exhibited by fungi may translate into differences in access to these resources among species. Small-scale natural disturbances that sever roots, mix soil horizons and litter layers, or change local pH and nutrient availability, are likely to create additional habitats for ectomycorrhizal fungi. Evidence from fruiting patterns and differences in colonization strategies suggest that such disturbances may be important for establishment of some species. Competitive replacement networks among species have the theoretical potential to increase diversity. The frequency of species replacements, observed co-infections of ectomycorrhizal fungi on single host roots, and high rates of rootlet turn-over all suggest that competition is important, but whether it plays a creative role in maintaining diversity remains to be demonstrated. Other organisms could be important in the maintenance of diversity, if they effect competition among mycorrhizal fungi. Bacteria and soil invertebrates are the most likely groups for such interactions. Technological advances in root observation and PCR methods for indentification of mycorrhizae make many of these theories testable. {\textcopyright} 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

In Panama, Laccaria is abundant in monodominant Oreomunnea mexicana (Juglandaceae) forests based on sporocarps and environmental sequencing of roots. This study uses a combination of morphological and phylogenetic evidence to document up to seven species of Laccaria from these forests, one previously described, three described as new, and three requiring more data before being formally described. Molecular data used for phylogenetic analysis include the nuclear ribosomal ITS and 28S regions, along with TEF1 and RPB2. Laccaria stellata, has previously been reported from O. mexicana cloud forests of Panama. Laccaria dallingii sp. nov., L. nitrophila sp. nov., and L. fortunensis sp. nov. are described as new based on morphology and phylogenetic analysis of multiple collections. A taxon referred to as “PAN sp3” is resolved sister to L. stellata. Phylogenetic analysis also resolved two separate clades of Panamanian Laccaria as sister to L. roseoalbescens, a species previously described from Mexico. These three taxa are not described in this paper as there is too little material from which to make effective morphological descriptions even though their placement in phylogenetic analysis identify them as being unique. Ecologically, all described species except for L. fortunensis were amplified from O. mexicana ectomycorrhizal root tips. L. nitrophila was one of the most recovered species from the roots of O. mexicana in a previous study, and it has been shown to respond positively to long term nitrogen addition. Our results expand the knowledge of Laccaria diversity for Central America and highlight that at least some species of Laccaria are nitrophilic in neotropical Juglandaceae forests as well as in temperate forests. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020 Corrales, Wilson, Mueller and Ovrebo.},

In this study, we focused on the most abundant deciduous species in Nordic countries, silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and its fine root dynamics, including the amount of litter produced by fine roots as well as by aboveground vegetation. 2. The minirhizotron method was used to quantify fine root longevity of silver birch and understory fine roots and rhizomes in northern Finland. Fine root biomass per basal area and ectomycorrhizal short root numbers per mg were also quantified. The fine root litter production was estimated by fine root biomass and longevity, and then compared with the aboveground litter collected with litter traps. 3. Birch fine root biomass was 1.4-fold higher than that of understory fine roots and rhizomes (234 ± 22, 171 ± 19 g m−2 respectively). Fine root longevity of birch (372 days) was significantly (P < 0.05) shorter than that of understory vegetation (643 days). The birch fine root longevity was positively related to root diameter and soil depth. Hazard analysis showed that thicker roots, long roots, roots produced late in the growing season, and roots growing deeper in the soil had relatively lower mortality hazard compared to the reference data. The total annual soil C input, including both birch and understory, was 283 g C m−2 yr−1. The proportion of understory annual C input was 35% of the total. Total annual belowground C input was 1.4-fold greater than that of aboveground. 4. Our study indicated that the total annual belowground litter production was greater than that of the aboveground litter in a boreal deciduous forest stand. Therefore, more emphasis should be put to quantify the C cycling of both above- and belowground parts of different tree species as well as understory in boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Fungi are crucial to forest ecosystem function and provide important provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services. As major contributors to biomass decomposition, fungi are important to forest biogeochemical cycling and maintenance of vertebrate animal diversity. Many forest plant species live in a symbiotic relationship with a fungal partner that helps a host plant to acquire nutrients and water. In addition, edible fungi are recreationally as well as economically valuable. However, most fungi live in very cryptic locations (e.g. in soils and interior plant tissues) and are only visible when their ephemeral fruiting bodies are produced, making fungal occurrence difficult to detect and predict. While remote sensing has been used increasingly to identify and scale many forest characteristics (e.g. structure, function, and species diversity) related to myriad ecosystem services, the use of remotely sensed data in modelling the occurrence of fungi is largely unknown. We compared the performance of airborne lidar derived structural variables, including those associated with single tree detection, with variables derived from field inventories to model overall fungal species abundance as well as specific fungal guilds (i.e. a range of edibility from highly edible to very poisonous, and the number of fruiting bodies of saprotrophic and mutualistic ectomycorrhizal species) based on fruiting body sampling in a low range mountain forest (Bavarian Forest National Park). Lidar derived variables performed better than variables derived from field measurements to explain the abundance of all guilds combined, as well as the guilds of soil saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi, and the yield of highly edible fungi. Variables derived from field measurements performed better than lidar derived variables in explaining the yield of very poisonous fungi. Upscaling of yield and abundance of fruiting bodies to the whole study area opens the avenue for managers to identify areas of high interest by mushroom pickers, as opposed to those of potential danger to people and those that co-occur with sensitive species and habitats of conservation relevance. Moreover, the strong, guild-specific relationships found between the occurrence of fungi and lidar derived variables opens new avenues for scaling to large areas the occurrence of members of this cryptic kingdom. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

At the end of 1 year of decomposition, most fungal communities had collapsed from their original diversity to two species, mainly in the Penicillium or Hypocrea clades. Two concurrent processes may explain these results: competition between closely related fungal taxa and phylogenetic conservation in cellulose decomposition. Our results suggest that phylogenetic relatedness of fungal communities may be a more appropriate metric than species richness or community composition to predict functional responses of fungal communities to global change. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Grassland afforestation with coniferous trees, occurring in many parts of the world, can greatly affect the nature and transformation of soil organic matter and associated nutrients, including phosphorus (P). This review critically examines the shifts in soil P availability and chemical nature, microbial properties and soil quality, and possible mechanisms involved in the changes in P nature and transformation as a result of grassland afforestation, based on the published and unpublished data from investigations carried out in recent years. Grassland afforestation with coniferous trees is found to enhance mineralization of organic matter and associated P and consequently improve P availability in topsoil. This is attributed to a combination of factors including the greater P demand and uptake by trees, the improved solubility of organic P by root and microbial exudates (e.g. low molecular weight organic acids), greater tree root phosphatase activity associated with ectomycorrhizae, and favourable soil moisture and temperature conditions. In addition, grassland afforestation also modifies the chemical nature of soil organic P, with a decrease of inositol phosphates (including myo- and scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate) in soil under forest compared with grassland. On the other hand, grassland afforestation leads to lower soil microbial biomass carbon (C) and P, soil respiration and phosphatase activity, indicating a decrease in soil biological fertility. This may be associated with lower and less labile organic inputs into the mineral soil under coniferous forest compared with grassland and other chemical changes (e.g. lower soil pH) due to grassland afforestation. Future studies should focus on quantifying root and leaf litter inputs and turnover, characterization of the source, chemical composition and role of organic acids in the solubilization and hydrolysis of organic P using isotopic tracing and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, assessment of shifts in the composition, activity and function of the soil microbial biomass in relation to grassland afforestation using appropriate molecular techniques, and comparative study on particular roles of different mycorrhizae-root associations on the utilization of organic P in the soil environment.

abstract = {Fine roots (⩽2 mm in diameter) of tree species, traditionally regarded as homogenous entities, are expected to be major contributors of forest soil organic carbon (C), but their contributions need to be reevaluated given the heterogeneity in many root characteristics within fine-root architecture. Here, literature data were synthesized to analyze whether there existed heterogeneity of decomposition rates within fine-root architecture of tree species and quantify the relative contributions of roots of each branching order to forest soil C storage by combining variations in annual litter inputs among fine-root branching hierarchies. Results showed the presence of heterogeneity in decomposition rates within fine-root architecture, and this pattern was influenced by classification methods (root order or diameter class). Specifically, the heterogeneity in decomposition rates was shown only when fine roots were classified by root order, but not when fine roots were classified by diameter class. The slower decomposition rates of lower-order roots (the first two orders) were related to their higher acid-unhydrolyzable residues. Furthermore, lower-order roots were found to account for 57–71% of annual root litter inputs of the first five orders. Given the slow decomposition rates and high annual litter inputs of lower-order roots of tree species, our findings suggest that lower-order roots should be important contributors to forest soil organic C. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

In five 1-ha forest inventory plots in the Upper Ireng and Upper Potaro River drainages basal areas of D. corymbosa ranged from 38.4-52.8 m2 ha-1 (63-85% of total) among all trees ≥10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh), values in the upper range for tropical moist forests worldwide. The high basal areas for D. corymbosa were due to the prevalence of large (>150 cm dbh), multi-stemmed individuals. Stem densities in Dicymbe plots ranged from 276-433 ha-1, with D. corymbosa contributing 24.6-59.8%. In three 1-ha mixed forest plots adjacent to the Dicymbe plots, D. corymbosa was absent. In the mixed forests, stem densities were higher (480-585 ha-1), basal areas were lower (36,7-39.8 m2 ha-1), species diversity was higher, and canopy tree species were more equitably distributed than in the Dicymbe plots. Tree community composition was not qualitatively different between Dicymbe and mixed forests. In the Dicymbe plots, mean sapling and seedling densities of D. corymbosa were significantly higher than most other canopy species, indicating persistent monodominance. Edaphic variation did not account for variation in forest composition. Life history traits are discussed which may contribute to clumping in D. corymbosa, including coppicing and mast-fruiting, and the potential role of litter-trapping physiognomy and ectomycorrhiza-mediated nutrient dynamics in promoting monodominance is noted.},

To test this idea, we coupled an optimality-based plant nitrogen (N) acquisition model with a microbe-focused soil organic matter (SOM) model. The model accurately predicted rhizosphere processes and C–N dynamics across a gradient of stands varying in their relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees. When mycorrhizal dominance was switched – ECM trees dominating plots previously occupied by AM trees, and vice versa – legacy effects were apparent, with consequences for both C and N stocks in soil. Under elevated productivity, ECM trees enhanced decomposition more than AM trees via microbial priming of unprotected SOM. Collectively, our results show that ecosystem responses to global change may hinge on the balance between rhizosphere priming and SOM protection, and highlight the importance of dynamically linking plants and microbes in terrestrial biosphere models. {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS},

abstract = {Plants produce above- and below-ground biomass. However, our understanding of both production and decomposition of below-ground biomass is poor, largely because of the difficulties of accessing roots. Below-ground organic matter decomposition studies are scant and especially rare in the tropics. In this study, we used a litter bag experiment to quantify the mass loss and nutrient dynamics of decomposing twigs and small roots from an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal associated tree, Parashorea chinensis Wang Hsie, in a tropical rain forest in Southwest China. Overall, twig litter decomposed 1.9 times faster than small roots (decay rate (k) twig = 0.255, root = 0.134). The difference in decomposition rates can be explained by a difference in phosphorus (P) concentration, availability, and use by decomposers or carbon quality. Twigs and small roots showed an increase in nitrogen concentration, with final concentrations still higher than initial levels. This suggests nitrogen transfer from the surrounding environment into decomposing twigs and small roots. Both carbon and nitrogen dynamics were significantly predicted by mass loss and showed a negative and positive relationship, respectively. Our study results imply that small roots carbon and nitrogen increase the resident time in the soil. Therefore, a better understanding of the carbon cycle requires a better understanding of the mechanisms governing below-ground biomass decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {Invasive species may leave behind legacies that persist even after removal, inhibiting subsequent restoration efforts. We examined the soil legacy of Cytisus scoparius, a nitrogen-fixing, putatively allelopathic shrub invading the western US. We tested the hypothesis that allelopathy plays a critical role in the depressive effect of Cytisus on the key native Douglas-fir, both directly on tree growth and indirectly via effects on its ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF). In a greenhouse factorial experiment, we used activated carbon to inhibit Cytisus-produced allelochemicals and sucrose to reduce elevated nitrogen (N). We found that: (1) Cytisus-invaded soils depressed Douglas-fir growth compared to uninvaded forest soils. The effect of adding Cytisus litter was positive (possibly reflecting an N fertilization effect) only in the presence of activated carbon, providing evidence for a role of allelopathic compounds. Activated carbon did not increase growth in the absence of Cytisus litter. Finally, sucrose addition provided weak support for a nitrogen effect of Cytisus litter. (2) Seedlings grown in Cytisus soils had lower EMF abundance compared to those in uninvaded forest soils. In forest soil from one site, adding Cytisus litter also decreased EMF abundance. Douglas-fir growth increased significantly with EMF across sites and soils suggesting that changes in EMF were linked to tree growth. The fungal taxon Cenococcum geophilum was significantly depressed in Cytisus soils compared to forest soils, while Rhizopogon rogersii abundance was similar across soil types. These results together suggest an overall negative effect of Cytisus on the growth of a dominant native tree and its fungal symbionts. Our study suggests how the role of allelopathy in ecological restoration may play out on two time scales: through immediate, direct impacts on native plants as well as through long-term, persistent impacts mediated by the collapse or transformation of microbial communities. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Basidiomycetes are the major agents of decomposition and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems, occurring as both saprotrophs and mycorrhizal symbionts (Boddy & Watkinson, 1995; Smith & Read, 1997). The mycelium can scavenge and sequester nutrients from soil, concentrate nutrients from decomposing organic matter, relocate nutrients between different organic resources, and ultimately make nutrients available to plants to maintain primary productivity. Hyphae of both saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes that ramify through soil often aggregate to form rapidly extending, persistent, specialized high-conductivity channels termed cords (Rayner italic., 1994, 1999; Boddy, 1999; Watkinson, 1999; Cairney, 2005). These cords form complex networks that can extend for metres or hectares in the natural environment. The distribution of resources is extremely heterogeneous and unpredictable in space and time, and these fungi have developed species-specific strategies to search for new resources and to capitalize on resources landing on their mycelial systems (Chapter 6, this volume). Thus the architecture of the network is not static, but is continuously reconfigured in response to local nutritional or environmental cues, damage or predation, through a combination of growth, branching, fusion or regression (Boddy, 1999; Watkinson, 1999; Chapter 6, this volume). At this stage it is not clear whether specific global mechanisms exist to couple local sensory perception and responses over different length scales specifically to maximize the long-term success of the whole colony, or whether such collective behaviour is an emergent property arising solely from local interactions of individual hyphae. {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.},

abstract = {Accurate projections of the future land carbon (C) sink by terrestrial biosphere models depend on how nutrient constraints on net primary production are represented. While nutrient limitation is nearly universal, current models do not have a C cost for plant nutrient acquisition. Also missing are symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi, which can consume up to 20% of net primary production and supply up to 50% of a plant's nitrogen (N) uptake. Here we integrate simultaneous uptake and mycorrhizae into a cutting-edge plant N model - Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN) - that can be coupled into terrestrial biosphere models. The C cost of N acquisition varies as a function of mycorrhizal type, with plants that support arbuscular mycorrhizae benefiting when N is relatively abundant and plants that support ectomycorrhizae benefiting when N is strongly limiting. Across six temperate forested sites (representing arbuscular mycorrhizal- and ectomycorrhizal-dominated stands and 176 site years), including multipath resistance improved the partitioning of N uptake between aboveground and belowground sources. Integrating mycorrhizae led to further improvements in predictions of N uptake from soil (R2 = 0.69 increased to R2 = 0.96) and from senescing leaves (R2 = 0.29 increased to R2 = 0.73) relative to the original model. On average, 5% and 9% of net primary production in arbuscular mycorrhizal- and ectomycorrhizal-dominated forests, respectively, was needed to support mycorrhizal-mediated acquisition of N. To the extent that resource constraints to net primary production are governed by similar trade-offs across all terrestrial ecosystems, integrating these improvements to FUN into terrestrial biosphere models should enhance predictions of the future land C sink. {\textcopyright}2014.

abstract = {The American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was once an integral part of eastern United States deciduous forests, with many environmental, economic, and social values. This ended with the introduction of an invasive fungal pathogen that wiped out over three billion trees. Transgenic American chestnuts expressing a gene for oxalate oxidase successfully tolerate infections by this blight fungus, but potential non-target environmental effects should be evaluated before new restoration material is released. Two greenhouse bioassays evaluated belowground interactions between transgenic American chestnuts and neighboring organisms found in their native ecosystems. Potential allelopathy was tested by germinating several types of seeds, all native to American chestnut habitats, in the presence of chestnut leaf litter. Germination was not significantly different in terms of number of seeds germinated or total biomass of germinated seedlings in transgenic and non-transgenic leaf litter. Separately, ectomycorrhizal associations were observed on transgenic and non-transgenic American chestnut roots using field soil inoculum. Root tip colonization was consistently high (>90% colonization) on all plants and not significantly different between any tree types. These observations on mycorrhizal fungi complement previous studies performed on older transgenic lines which expressed oxalate oxidase at lower levels. Along with other environmental impact comparisons, these conclusions provide further evidence that transgenic American chestnuts are not functionally different with regard to ecosystem interactions than non-transgenic American chestnuts. {\textcopyright} 2018 Newhouse, Oakes, Pilkey, Roden, Horton and Powell.},

abstract = {We studies the seasonal dynamics of phenolics in leaves, litter and soil of the dominant host tree oak (Quercus robur L.) growing with ectomycorrhizal fungi truffles (T. macrosporum) in oak forest (Fraxino angustifoliae-Quercetum roboris Jov. et Tomi{\'{c}} 1979) near River Danube, near Belgrade. In litter, the highest content of free phenolics was in April (primordial growth period of truffles) and bound phenolics in August (truffles ripening- start of harvest). Due to intensive decomposition of forest litter during the vegetative growth period, free phenolic acids increased and the bound phenolic acids decreased. There was reduction in ratio of bound cinnamic to benzoic acids, it indicated the microbial degradation of lignin and the transformation of cinnamic derivatives into benzoic acid derivatives. In the top soil layer, where the majority of truffle fruit bodies were found (28.31 kg/ha/year), the free phenolics (direct influence on truffle growth and development) contents were up to 58.36 $\mu$g/g. As the mycelia and fruit bodies of truffle grow in phenolic-rich forest soil, hence, we assumed that the truffle is well-adapted to high phenolics content. {\textcopyright} 2015, International Allelopathy Foundation.

abstract = {Massive moth outbreaks cause large-scale damage in subarctic mountain birch forests with a concomitant decrease in carbon flux to mycorrhizal fungi and an increased deposition of dissolved carbon and nutrients as moth frass into soil. We investigated impacts of moth herbivory along three replicated gradients with three levels of moth herbivory (undamaged, once damaged, repeatedly damaged) on soil nutrient levels and biological parameters. We found an increase in soil nutrients and in the biomass of enchytraeid worms, which are key faunal decomposers. Fungi : bacteria ratio and C:N ratio decreased in humus with increasing severity of herbivory. Our findings suggest enhanced resource turnover in mountain birch forests due to massive moth herbivory. This may provide a shortcut for carbon and nutrient input to subarctic soils, which largely bypasses the main routes of carbon from plants to soil via mycorrhizal and litter-decomposing fungi. Moreover, a temporal shift occurs in carbon allocation to soil, providing decomposers an opportunity to use an earlyseason peak in resource availability. Our results suggest a hitherto unappreciated role of massive insect herbivore attacks on resource dynamics in subarctic ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Spore characteristics of wood-inhabiting fungi suggest that wind is their predominant dispersal vector. However, since they are restricted to ephemeral habitats, colonizing new patches should benefit from dispersal by animals with similar habitat preferences because the directed, resource-searching movement of animals increases the likelihood of reaching suitable habitats. Here we determine which fungal guilds are carried by wood-inhabiting beetles and what influences beetle-associated fungal communities. High-throughput sequencing identified >1800 fungal taxa from beetle communities that emerged from 64 experimental logs. Beetle-associated fungi included mutualistic, decomposing, pathogenic and mycorrhizal fungi; decomposers were the most diverse. Partial-procrustes analysis revealed that the total beetle-associated community and mutualists were correlated (p ≤ 0.05) with beetle community composition and decomposers were marginally correlated (p ≤ 0.10) with beetle community composition. All three groups were marginally correlated with the total fungal communities that inhabit the dead wood. Our results show that beetles carry a broad range of wood-inhabiting fungi and beetle-associated fungal communities are determined by environmental factors and the vectoring beetle community and to some degree by the fungal source community. This suggests that wood-inhabiting beetles contribute to fungal dispersal, including directed dispersal, which could affect fungal community assembly and ecosystem processes like wood decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society},

Such rhizosphere effect has been increasingly recognized to play a crucial role in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we investigated the rhizosphere effects of 12 tree species associated with two contrasting mycorrhizal types (arbuscular mycorrhizal, AM vs. ectomycorrhizal, ECM) and co-occurring in a temperate secondary forest in Northeast China. The adhering soil method was adopted to sample paired rhizosphere and bulk soils of field-grown trees in the peak growing season. Generally, we found positive rhizosphere effects on soil properties (ammonium and nitrate content, total C and N content, and C:N ratio), microbial abundances (bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes), enzyme activities (C- and N-degradation enzymes), and C mineralization rate (Cmin), but minor rhizosphere effects on soil pH, phosphorus content and phosphatase activity, net N mineralization rate (Nmin), and specific Cmin and Nmin (per unit soil C or N). Because of large intraspecific and particularly interspecific variations, less than half of the rhizosphere effects were statistically significant (P < 0.05), and none of the rhizosphere effects differed significantly between the two mycorrhizal types (AM vs. ECM). Moreover, most soil variables varied greatly within and across species, and thus did not differ significantly between the two mycorrhizal types (AM vs. ECM). However, soil pH, nitrate content, microbial abundance, and C-degradation enzyme activity were notably lower under ECM species than under AM species. Collectively, these results show that rhizosphere effects varied greatly among the six species within both mycorrhizal groups, and such variations within mycorrhizal group were even larger than those between mycorrhizal group. Future work should include a larger number of tree species to increase statistical power, and combine phylogenic history and functional traits of plant species with the type and traits of mycorrhizal fungi to better understand how plant-microbe interactions influence biogeochemical cycling in the rhizosphere. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The widespread use of forest litter as animal bedding in central Europe for many centuries gave rise to the first litter manipulation studies, and their results demonstrated that litter and its decomposition are a vital part of ecosystem function. Litter plays two major roles in forest ecosystems: firstly, litterfall is an inherent part of nutrient and carbon cycling, and secondly, litter forms a protective layer on the soil surface that also regulates microclimatic conditions. By reviewing 152 years of litter manipulation experiments, I show that the effects of manipulating litter stem from changes in one, or both, of these two functions, and interactions between the variables influenced by the accumulation of litter can result in feedback mechanisms that may intensify treatment effects or mask responses, making the interpretation of results difficult. Long-term litter removal increased soil bulk density, overland flow, erosion, and temperature fluctuations and upset the soil water balance, causing lower soil water content during dry periods. Soil pH increased or decreased in response to manipulation treatments depending on forest type and initial soil pH, but it is unclear why there was no uniform response. Long-term litter harvesting severely depleted the forests of nutrients. Decreases in the concentrations of available P, Ca, Mg, and K in the soil occurred after only three to five years. The decline in soil N occurred over longer periods of time, and the relative loss was greater in soils with high initial nitrogen concentration. Tree growth declined with long-term litter removal, probably due to lower nutrient availability. Litter manipulation also added or removed large amounts of carbon thereby affecting microbial communities and altering soil respiration rates. Litter manipulation experiments have shown that litter cover acts as a physical barrier to the shoot emergence of small-seeded species; further, the microclimate maintained by the litter layer may be favourable to herbivores and pathogens and is important in determining later seedling survival and performance. Litter manipulation altered the competitive outcomes between tree seedlings and forbs, thereby influencing species composition and diversity; changes in the species composition of understorey vegetation following treatments occurred fairly rapidly. By decreasing substrate availability and altering the microclimate, litter removal changed fungal species composition and diversity and led to a decline in populations of soil fauna. However, litter addition did not provoke a corresponding increase in the abundance or diversity of fungi or soil fauna. Large-scale long-term studies are still needed in order to investigate the interactions between the many variables affected by litter, especially in tropical and boreal forests, which have received little attention. Litter manipulation treatments present an opportunity to assess the effects of increasing primary production in forest ecosystems; specific research aims include assessing the effects of changes in litter inputs on the carbon and nutrient cycles, decomposition processes, and the turnover of organic matter. {\textcopyright} 2006 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

abstract = {Ferriferous savannas, also known as cangas in Brazil, are nutrient-impoverished ecosystems adapted to seasonal droughts. These ecosystems support distinctive vegetation physiognomies and high plant diversity, although little is known about how nutrient and water availability shape these ecosystems. Our study was carried out in the cangas from Caraj{\'{a}}s, eastern Amazonia, Brazil. To investigate the N cycling and drought adaptations of different canga physiognomies and compare the findings with those from other ecosystems, we analyzed nutrient concentrations and isotope ratios ($\delta$13C and $\delta$15N) of plants, litter, and soils from 36 plots distributed in three physiognomies: typical scrubland (SB), Vellozia scrubland (VL), and woodland (WD). Foliar $\delta$15N values in cangas were higher than those in savannas but lower than those in tropical forests, indicating more conservative N cycles in Amazonian cangas than in forests. The lower $\delta$15N in savanna formations may be due to a higher importance of mycorrhizal species in savanna vegetation than in canga vegetation. Elevated $\delta$13C values indicate higher water shortage in canga ecosystems than in forests. Foliar and litter nutrient concentrations vary among canga physiognomies, indicating differences in nutrient dynamics. Lower nutrient availability, higher C:N ratios, and lower $\delta$15N values characterize VL, whereas WD is delineated by lower $\delta$13C values and higher soil P. These results suggest lower water restriction and lower P limitation in WD, whereas VL shows more conserved N cycles due to lower nutrient availability. Differences in nutrient and water dynamics among physiognomies indicate different ecological processes; thus, the conservation of all physiognomies is required to ensure the maintenance of functional diversity in this unique ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract = {Summary: In northern forests, belowground sequestration of nitrogen (N) in complex organic pools restricts nutrient availability to plants. Oxidative extracellular enzymes produced by ectomycorrhizal fungi may aid plant N acquisition by providing access to N in macromolecular complexes. We test the hypotheses that ectomycorrhizal Cortinarius species produce Mn-dependent peroxidases, and that the activity of these enzymes declines at elevated concentrations of inorganic N. In a boreal pine forest and a sub-arctic birch forest, Cortinarius DNA was assessed by 454-sequencing of ITS amplicons and related to Mn-peroxidase activity in humus samples with- and without previous N amendment. Transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes was investigated in field samples. Phylogenetic analyses of Cortinarius peroxidase amplicons and genome sequences were performed. We found a significant co-localization of high peroxidase activity and DNA from Cortinarius species. Peroxidase activity was reduced by high ammonium concentrations. Amplification of mRNA sequences indicated transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes under field conditions. The Cortinarius glaucopus genome encodes 11 peroxidases - a number comparable to many white-rot wood decomposers. These results support the hypothesis that some ectomycorrhizal fungi - Cortinarius species in particular - may play an important role in decomposition of complex organic matter, linked to their mobilization of organically bound N. {\textcopyright} 2014 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract = {Pyrophilous macrofungi (PM) are a narrowly specialised group appearing exclusively in plant communities recently destroyed by fire. Their significance has hitherto been studied only for vegetation destroyed over large areas, while in small areas of fire, i.e., microhabitats they are viewed as independent components of the community linked only to the substratum. In the present work, the following hypotheses were tested: (1) species structures of PM in microhabitats depend on the type of plant community, (2) PM form communities on a small scale which are similar in structure and function to analogous large scale communities. We studied 20 surfaces destroyed by illegal campfires in four natural plant communities: oak-hornbeam forest Tilio-Carpinetum (TC), lowland acidophilus beech forest Luzulo pilosae-Fagetum (LF), suboceanic pine forest Leucobryo-Pinetum (LP), and an initial-phase xerothermic grassland community on a transitional habitat (MH). TC and LF habitats were conspicuously more favourable for PM than LP and MH. In TC and LF fire leads to significant loss of mycorrhizae in the upper layer of leaf litter. This provides a development opportunity for ectomycorrhizal PM species which, having little competition, substitute for the destroyed fragments of mycorrhizal networks. In LP and MH fire over a small surface does not destroy more deeply located mycorrhizal associations. Another important factor for PM influencing the quality of environment is the fertility of soil: highest in TC, intermediate in LF and lowest in LP and MH. The results casts doubt on the concept that PM are only synusia linked to the substratum (burnt wood). PM growing in microhabitats constitute an important group of organisms which facilitate rapid regeneration of plant community fragments destroyed by fire. {\textcopyright} 2012 The British Mycological Society.},

This study investigated the structures and identified the drivers of soil fungal communities in subtropical deciduous and evergreen broadleaved forests, using high-throughput sequencing and FUNGuild for fungal identification and assignment to the trophic guild. Fungal richness was much higher in the deciduous than in the evergreen forest. Both forests were dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla, but saprophytic fungi were more abundant in the deciduous forest and ectomycorrhizal fungi predominated in the evergreen forest. Fungal communities had strong links to plant and soil properties. Specifically, plant diversity and litter biomass were the main aboveground drivers of fungal diversity and composition in the deciduous forest, while host effects were prominent in the evergreen forest. The belowground factors, i.e., soil pH, water content, and nutrients especially available P, were identified as the primary drivers of soil fungal communities in the broadleaved forests. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed assembly of fungal composition in broadleaved forest soils was non-random. The smaller modularity of the network in the deciduous forest reflects lower resistance to environment changes. Concluding, these results showed that plant community attributes, soil properties, and potential interactions among fungal functional guilds operate jointly on the divergence of soil fungal community assembly in the two broadleaved forest types. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {Fungi are primary agents of organic matter decomposition in forests. Although invertebrate grazing affects fungal biomass and morphology, the species-specific consequences of these interactions are little understood. Using three collembola species (Folsomia candida, Protaphorura armata, Proisotoma minuta) we employed a multi-trophic approach to investigate the individual effects of invertebrate grazing on four species of saprotrophic basidiomycete fungi growing in two species (one fungus: one collembola) soil microcosms. We studied these effects at three trophic levels: the rate of wood decay brought about by the fungi was assessed; fungal growth was characterized across multiple time points using a range of image analysis parameters (radial extension, hyphal coverage, fractal dimension); and collembola abundance was determined at the end of the experiment. Collembola species had different impacts both within and across fungal species; F. candida had the greatest effect on fungal mycelia whereas P. armata often had little impact. Fungal species varied in their resilience to grazing; all collembola species modified Phanerochaete velutina and Hypholoma fasciculare morphology, that of Resinicium bicolor was only markedly affected by F. candida, and effects on Phallus impudicus were negligible. In the case of H. fasciculare, these grazing effects translated into effects on the rate of fungus-induced wood decay: F. candida and P. armata, but not P. minuta, reduced wood decay rate compared to ungrazed controls. Rate of wood decay was unaffected in the other three fungal species. Changes in collembola population size were generally consistent across fungal species, with each species achieving a greater abundance on P. velutina than on H. fasciculare and P. impudicus. The collembola species did, however, respond differently to R. bicolor, with F. candida being more successful than P. armata. Our study suggests that a wide range of impacts can occur during fungus-collembola interactions, and that caution should be exercised when treating saprotrophic fungi and mycophagous collembola as uniform functional components. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Proper estimates of decomposition are essential for tropical forests, given their key role in the global carbon (C) cycle. However, the current paradigm for litter decomposition is insufficient to account for recent observations and may limit model predictions for highly diverse tropical ecosystems. In light of recent findings from a nutrient-poor Amazonian rainforest, we revisit the commonly held views that: litter traits are a mere legacy of live leaf traits; nitrogen (N) and lignin are the key litter traits controlling decomposition; and favourable climatic conditions result in rapid decomposition in tropical forests. Substantial interspecific variation in litter phosphorus (P) was found to be unrelated to variation in green leaves. Litter nutrients explained no variation in decomposition, which instead was controlled primarily by nonlignin litter C compounds at low concentrations with important soil fauna effects. Despite near-optimal climatic conditions, tropical litter decomposition proceeded more slowly than in a climatically less favourable temperate forest. We suggest that slow decomposition in the studied rainforest results from a syndrome of poor litter C quality beyond a simple lignin control, enforcing energy starvation of decomposers. We hypothesize that the litter trait syndrome in nutrient-poor tropical rainforests may have evolved to increase plant access to limiting nutrients via mycorrhizal associations. {\textcopyright} The Authors (2010).

abstract = {Among the huge array of hypogeous ectomycorrhizal fungi so far documented from Australia, six genera and more than 30 species occur within the family Mesophelliaceae, all of which show various adaptations for surviving in fire-prone landscapes. These mostly endemic fungi are critical to postfire reestablishment of regenerating vegetation, and their fruit-bodies provide essential food resources for diverse ground-dwelling fauna. We developed habitat models for five common representatives of the Mesophelliaceae based on repeat collections of their fruit-bodies from 136 study plots situated along a series of environmental gradients across the south-eastern mainland of Australia. At a meso- or landscape scale, temperature influenced the occurrence of Castoreum radicatum, Mesophellia clelandii and Nothocastoreum cretaceum, with the type of response varying. Below a threshold, C. radicatum preferred sites with cooler mean annual temperatures. In contrast, M. clelandii and N. cretaceum had optimal ranges of temperature, above and below which the probability of detecting them dropped. Also at a landscape scale, C. radicatum was more likely to be detected at sites with lower levels of precipitation during the driest quarter of the year. At a micro-site scale, M. clelandii and N. cretaceum were more likely to occur in stands with an intermediate number of host eucalypt stems, likely relating to successional age of the stand. Sites with a higher number of large fallen trees were more likely to have N. cretaceum, while sites with intermediate litter depths were more likely to have C. radicatum and M. clelandii. Mesophellia glauca and M. trabalis showed no consistent patterns. They are apparently the most broadly adaptable in terms of the independent variables tested. Although fire has been previously suggested to be heavily implicated in the life cycle of several members of the Mesophelliaceae, we found no relationship between time since disturbance by fire and other factors and likelihood of occurrence. Instead, other habitat attributes appeared to be more important in explaining their distribution. The complex and differing responses of the species of Mesophelliaceae studied here, to features of their environment, reinforce the need to manage multiple-use forest landscapes across the region for a diversity of attributes. {\textcopyright} 2009 The British Mycological Society.},

abstract = {Climate warming and associated increases in nutrient mineralization may increase the availability of soil nitrogen (N) in high latitude ecosystems, such as boreal forests. These changes in N availability could feed back to affect the decomposition of litter and organic matter by soil microbes. Since fungi are important decomposers in boreal forest ecosystems, we conducted a 69-day incubation study to examine N constraints on fungal decomposition of organic substrates common in boreal ecosystems, including cellulose, lignin, spruce wood, spruce needle litter, and moss litter. We added 0, 20, or 200 $\mu$g N to vials containing 200 mg substrate in factorial combination with five fungal species isolated from boreal soil, including an Ascomycete, a Zygomycete, and three Basidiomycetes. We hypothesized that N addition would increase CO2 mineralization from the substrates, particularly those with low N concentrations. In addition we predicted that Basidiomycetes would be more effective decomposers than the other fungi, but would respond weakly or negatively to N additions. In support of the first hypothesis, cumulative CO2 mineralization increased from 635 ± 117 to 806 + 108 $\mu$g C across all fungal species and substrates in response to 20 $\mu$g added N; however, there was no significant increase at the highest level of N addition. The positive effect of N addition was only significant on cellulose and wood substrates which contained very little N. We also observed clear differences in the substrate preferences of the fungal species. The Zygomycete mineralized little CO2 from any of the substrates, while the Basidiomycetes mineralized all of the substrates except spruce needles. However, the Ascomycete (Penicillium) was surprisingly efficient at mineralizing spruce wood and was the only species that substantially mineralized spruce litter. The activities of $\beta$-glucosidase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase were strongly correlated with cumulative respiration (r = 0.78 and 0.74, respectively), and Penicillium was particularly effective at producing these enzymes. On moss litter, the different fungal species produced enzymes that targeted different chemical components. Overall, our results suggest that fungal species specialize on different organic substrates, and only respond to N addition on low N substrates, such as wood. Furthermore, the response to N addition is non-linear, with the greatest substrate mineralization at intermediate N levels. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fine roots account for a substantial proportion of forest production and their decomposition releases large amounts of nutrients to the soil ecosystem. However, little is known about the fungi involved in ECM decomposition, including assemblages of fungal saprotrophs, endophytes, and the ECM fungi themselves. To follow fungal succession during the degradation of senescing fine roots, understory seedlings of Abies balsamea and Picea rubens at two sites in the Acadian forest of Nova Scotia were either severed at the root collar or left as controls. Root systems were collected sequentially over two growing seasons and assessed for fine root loss and ECM mantle integrity. ECM were identified by ITS-PCR and grouped into broad morphological categories. Fungal communities colonizing the senescing fine roots were also monitored by systematically constructing clone libraries over the course of the experiment. ECM with cottony, weakly pigmented mantles (e.g., Cortinarius) degraded within the first year. Those with cottony, but intensely pigmented mantles (Piloderma), and smooth mantles with weak pigmentation (Russulaceae) degraded more slowly. Smooth, melanized ECM (Cenococcum and Tomentella) generally maintained integrity over the course of the experiment. Rates of fine root loss and changes in ECM mantle integrity were positively correlated with soil temperature. ECM DNA was detected throughout the experiment, and was not replaced by that of saprotrophic species during the two seasons sampled. However, fungal root endophytes (e.g., Helotiaceae) initially increased in abundance and then decreased as mantles degraded, suggesting a possible role in ECM decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {• Introduction: Important nutrients in forest soils such as nitrogen and phosphorus are mostly recycled from natural polymeric compounds contained in litter and organic debris-for example nucleic acids, proteins, or chitin. • Objectives: Activities of enzymes such as phosphatases, proteases, cellulases, chitinases and laccase were shown in saprotrophic but also in ectomycorrhizal fungi and there is increasing evidence that these enzymes contribute not only to the functioning of the symbiosis but also to the mobilisation of nutrients. In the present review, we describe how enzyme secretion and localisation on fungal hyphae may be connected to the potential role in soil nutrient cycling. • Results: Recently developed methods for enzyme activity studies of ectomycorrhizae directly assayed in or collected from the field such as enzyme activity profiling and soil imprinting are described. Their value and limitations in different examples of ecological studies is highlighted and discussed also with respect to the role of other soil microorganisms associated with ectomycorrhizae. • Conclusion: The conclusion from our review is that enzyme activities of ECM and their associated microorganisms provide a potentially enormous plasticity of mycorrhizosphere functionality which is an open field for further research.

abstract = {Many saprotrophic fungi, especially basidiomycetes, which are able to grow out of the substratum that they are colonizing in search of new resources (i.e., nonresource-unit-restricted fungi) form mycelial cords, which are aggregations of predominantly parallel, longitudinally aligned hyphae. These cords often form extensive, long-lived systems which interconnect discrete nutrient resources, e.g. woody litter components, on the floor of boreal, temperate and tropical forests, and some can form networks in tropical canopies. They exhibit foraging strategies which vary among species, and which alter depending on resource quantity and quality, the presence of other organisms, and microclimatic environment. The morphological patterns they form are well described by fractal geometry. Their mycelia show remarkable patterns of reallocation of biomass and mineral nutrients when new resources are encountered during mycelial foraging or when new resources are added to mature systems. Mycelial-cord systems encountering heterogeneously distributed organic substrata coordinate use of available resources so that demands are met by 'spreading the load' through the system. The persistent networks, ability to forage for new resources, and ability to reallocate mycelial biomass and nutrients exhibited by saprotrophic cord-forming fungi provide a solution to the problems of life in a spatially and temporally heterogenous environment. Response to the heterogenous environment in which these fungi exist generates heterogeneity in themselves, and they in turn generate heterogeneity in their environment, both in space and time.},

Our hypothesis was that tree species shape the non-mycorrhizal fungal assemblages in soil and litter and that the diversity of fungal communities in these two compartments is partly dependent on the coverage of trees in the Neotropical rainforest. In French Guiana, a long-term plantation and a natural forest were selected to test this hypothesis. Fungal ITS1 regions were sequenced from soil and litter samples from within the vicinity of tree species. A broad range of fungal taxa was found, with 42 orders and 14 classes. Significant spatial heterogeneity in the fungal communities was found without strong variation in the species richness and evenness among the tree plots. However, tree species shaped the fungal assemblages in the soil and litter, explaining up to 18 % of the variation among the communities in the natural forest. These results demonstrate that vegetation cover has an important effect on the structure of fungal assemblages inhabiting the soil and litter in Amazonian forests, illustrating the relative impact of deterministic processes on fungal community structures in these highly diverse ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Traditional silvicultural treatments have limited success in regenerating these sites. We tested whether forest floor mixing and planting black spruce seedlings preinoculated with an ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungus, Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr., has potential to improve black spruce growth in Kalmia-dominated sites. We measured growth and foliar nutrient concentrations of ECM-inoculated and control black spruce seedlings planted in burned and insect-defoliated sites after forest floor mixing in Terra Nova National Park, Newfoundland. We also measured soil moisture, temperature, pH, total phenol and nutrient concentrations, litter decomposition, and soil respiration in those sites. Seedlings in soil-mixed plots had significantly higher growth and foliar nutrient concentrations than nonmixed plots, likely because soil mixing improved the substrate conditions by increased soil moisture, pH, and litter decomposition. Seedlings in insect-defoliated sites had significantly higher increases in height and foliar nutrient concentrations than those in the burned sites. Inoculated seedlings had significantly higher initial ECM formation than the control seedlings, but they failed to achieve higher growth.},

Japanese oak forests of Fukushima and the northern Kanto area were contaminated with radiocesium (137Cs) by Fukusima Dai-ichi nuclear Power Plant accident. 137Cs trapped at the surface soil has a deleterious effect on forest ecosystem and poses further threat to humans when it enters the food chain. The uptake of 137Cs and other essential nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) by plants with the aid of ectomycorrhizal fungi is affected by soil water content. The objective of this study was to evaluate the colonization rate of ectomycorrhiza (CRE) and its impact on nutrients and 137Cs uptake pattern by oak (Quercus serrata Thunb.) seedlings at different soil water content levels under greenhouse condition. The result shows that the growth of Q. serrata seedlings increased with increasing soil water content. In addition, the highest CRE was observed in the low water content (LW) and was significantly different from the high water content treatment (HW). The LW treatment showed the highest N and P concentration in leaves and roots although no statistical differences were observed compared to the other treatments. Treatments with 137Cs-amended litter showed increased 137Cs concentration in the leaves of plants and its leaf per root ratio increased with decreasing soil water content. The results of the present study also suggest enhanced 137Cs absorption and translocation into Q. serrata seedlings is with the aid of ectomycorrhizal fungus except for the seedlings in HW. {\textcopyright} 2019, International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering.},

In this study, we analyzed the effects of major European tree species (Fagus sylvatica L. and Picea abies (L.) Karst) on soil bacterial and fungal communities. Mineral soil samples were collected from different depths (0-10, 10-20 cm) and at different horizontal distances from beech or spruce trunks (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 m) in early summer and autumn. We assessed the composition of soil bacterial and fungal communities based on 16S rRNA gene and ITS DNA sequences. Community composition of bacteria and fungi was most strongly affected by soil pH and tree species. Different ectomycorrhizal fungi (e.g., Tylospora) known to establish mutualistic associations with plant roots showed a tree species preference. Moreover, bacterial and fungal community composition showed spatial and seasonal shifts in soil surrounding beech and spruce. The relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi was higher at a depth of 0-10 vs. 10-20 cm depth. This was presumably a result of changes in nutrient availability, as litter input and organic carbon content decreased with soil depth. Overall bacterial community composition showed strong variations under spruce with increasing distance from the tree trunks, which might be attributed in part to higher fine root biomass near spruce trunks. Furthermore, overall bacterial community composition was strongly affected by season under deciduous trees. {\textcopyright} 2016 Nacke, Goldmann, Sch{\"{o}}ning, Pfeiffer, Kaiser, Castillo-Villamizar, Schrumpf, Buscot, Daniel and Wubet.},

abstract = {Nematodes of different trophic groups control distinct energy channels, though their exact trophic links remain little understood. Molecular data suggest that soil nematodes are readily consumed by a wide range of other soil animals, but the significance of these interactions remains unknown. We used stable isotope analysis to gain a better understanding of the trophic niches of soil nematodes in a boreal forest. We tested four taxonomic groups, Mononchida, Dorylaimida, Plectidae and Tylenchidae (mostly from the genus Filenchus), representing predators, omnivores, bacterivores and root-fungal feeders, respectively. To assess the trophic position of nematodes, we used a set of reference species including herbivorous, saprophagous and predatory macro-invertebrates, oribatid and mesostigmatid mites, and collembolans. The trophic positions of the investigated groups of soil nematodes generally agree with common knowledge. All nematodes were enriched in 13C relative to Picea abies roots and litter, as well as to fungal mycelium analyzed. Root-fungal feeders Tylenchidae had $\delta$15N values similar to those of earthworms, enchytraeids and Entomobrya collembolans. In contrast, bacterivorous Plectidae were enriched in 15N compared to saprophagous macroinvertebrates and most mesofauna species. Omnivorous Dorylaimida and predatory Mononchida were further enriched in 15N and their isotopic signature was very similar to that of predatory arthropods. These data confirm a clear separation of nematodes into microbial feeders (Tylenchidae and Plectidae) and predators (Mononchida and Dorylaimida). They also suggest that the trophic position of soil animals is largely independent of their body size, the smallest soil predators like nematodes occupying the same trophic level as predatory macro-invertebrates. Our data failed to confirm that bacterivorous or predatory soil nematodes are important prey for oribatid mites or collembolans. The patterns of isotopic signatures indicate that soil nematodes and the bulk of soil animals depend on resources derived from a dominating upper-canopy tree (P. abies) via the detrital rather than mycorrhizal pathway. Herbaceous plants and dwarf shrubs do not contribute significantly to the energy budget of soil communities in the boreal forest studied. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

individually on irradiated hazel litter and exposed to c. 0.030 mul l-1
of gaseous SO2 for 28 d in the laboratory. The gas inhibited the
respiration of Phoma exigua Desm. and Phoma macrostoma Mont. but not the
respiration of Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fres.) de Vries or
Coniothyrium quercinum Sacc. var. glandicola Grove. These results in
part substantiated findings of previous experiments examining the
effects of SO2 on the structures of saprotrophic fungal communities. The
effects of SO2 on fungal decomposition of angiosperm tree leaf litter as

abstract = {Although the importance of coarse woody debris (CWD) for species diversity is recognized, the effects of coarse woody debris decay class on species composition have received little attention. We examined how the species composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) changes with CWD decay. We describe ectomycorrhizal root tips and the diversity of mycorrhizal fungal species at three English oak (Quercus robur L.) sites. DNA barcoding revealed a total of 17 ECM fungal species. The highest degree of mycorrhizal colonization was found in CWDadvanced (27.2%) and CWDearly (27.1%). Based on exploration types, ectomycorrhizae were classified with respect to ecologically relevant soil features. The short distance type was significantly correlated with soil P2O5, while the contact type was correlated with soil C/N. The lowest mean content of soil Corg was found in the CWDabsent site. The difference in total soil N between sites decreased with increasing CWD decomposition, whereas total C/N increased correspondingly. In this study we confirmed that soil CWD stimulates ectomycorrhizal fungi, representing contact or short-distance exploration types of mycelium. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {The nutrient mobilizing activities of mycelia of two ectomycorrhizal fungi, Suillus bovinus (Fr.) O. Kuntze and Thelephora terrestris (Ehrh.), were investigated in transparent root observation chambers to which were added discrete weighed samples of organic matter collected from the fermentation horizon of a pine‐forest soil. The mycelia grew from mycorrhizal plants of Pinus sylvestris L. over a homogeneous humified peat and colonized the introduced fermentation horizon organic matter (FHOM). The chronology of intensive mycelial exploitation of the FHOM was followed, and its nutrient status was monitored before and after colonization by the fungal mycelia. The time from initial colonization to early senescence of mycelial patches was c. 40 d. Colonization by S. bovinus reduced concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K.) in FHOM by 23, 22 and 30%, respectively, whereas colonization by T. terrestris led to decreases of N and K of 13 and 21 % respectively, but did not change P concentration. There were increases in calcium and magnesium concentration following colonization by terrestris. Analyses of the inorganic N pool of uncolonized FHOM incubated separately suggested that mineralization rates were inadequate to explain the loss of N from the colonized material. The carbon to nitrogen ratio of material colonized by both fungi increased greatly relative to that in uncolonized material. The significance of these nutrient transfer processes is discussed in relation to element cycling processes in boreal forest ecosystems. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract = {A large proportion of the soil carbon (C) in boreal forests originates from roots and ectomycorrhizal fungi, and accurate quantification of fine-root litter production is needed. Methods for determination of root turnover have been under debate in recent years. Two recently used methods—radiocarbon (14C) dating and use of minirhizotrons (MR)—have yielded different results. This has been attributed to analysis of different roots by use of these methods. At Flakaliden, northern Sweden, in a long-term soil warming and irrigation experiment, we compared MR lifespan with the 14C-derived age of fine roots from soil cores of the same root diameter class. We also determined the 14C-derived age of ingrowth core roots of Norway spruce. The median lifespan of fine roots around MR tubes installed 15 years previously was shorter than 2.5 years whereas the 14C-derived age of the fine roots from soil cores varied from recently grown to 14 years. Correspondingly, the age of 14C in fine roots harvested from ingrowth cores installed in soil 3 months previously was between 1 and 20 years. Thus, cellulose in these roots contained older 14C than is possible from photosynthesis during the time of cellulose formation. By investigating whether the age of Norway spruce and Scots pine seedlings was less than their root 14C-derived age, we tested the possibility of root C originating from soil uptake. This was found to be unlikely, because fine roots of four and eight-year-old seedlings had 14C that was dated to be as old as or younger than the seedlings. We propose that further effort is required to identify the ecological conditions leading to root growth utilization of stored or recycled C. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Milium effusum L. (Wood Millet) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. The grass Milium effusum is a common species of mature woodland in central and southern England, but is less common in the wetter parts of northern England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. World-wide, the species is native to many temperate, boreal, subarctic and subalpine parts of the northern hemisphere: from eastern North America across most of Europe (excluding Mediterranean climates) to the Ural Mountains and Black Sea, extending eastwards to the Himalaya, Korea and Japan. Wood Millet is a shade-tolerant, relatively tall grass (up to 1{\textperiodcentered}8 m) producing up to 700 caryopses per individual. It is characteristic of temperate deciduous woodland, but can also occur in other woodland and forest types and even in scrub, alpine meadows, along railways and roads, and on rocks. In woods, it is one of the most conspicuous plants of the herb layer in the early summer after the disappearance of spring flowering species. While the species is generally considered an ancient woodland indicator in England and western Europe, it is also known to colonize secondary, post-agricultural forests relatively rapidly in other areas such as Denmark, southern Sweden and Poland. The species has a wide amplitude in terms of soil acidity and nutrient availability, but predominantly grows on soils of intermediate soil fertility and soil pH and with high organic matter concentration. However, M. effusum can tolerate large quantities of tree-leaf litter on the forest floor and is able to grow on very acidic soils. Changes in land use, climate, densities of large herbivores and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen are having effects on populations of Wood Millet. Significant responses of the life-history traits and population characteristics have been detected in response to environmental variation and to experimental treatments of temperature, nutrients, light and acidity. In many of its habitats across its range, M. effusum is currently becoming more frequent. During the last century, its mean elevation of occurrence in upland areas of Europe has also increased by several hundreds of metres. Typically, management actions are directed towards the conservation of its main habitat type (e.g. ancient woodlands of the Milio-Fagetum association) rather than to the species specifically. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {Deforestation of tropical peat swamp forests is rapidly taking place across Southeast Asia to make way for agricultural expansion. Within forest ecosystems, macrofungi play a vital role, including wood decomposition and nutrient cycles. To reveal the effects of deforestation and land cover conversion on macrofungi in Southeast Asian tropical forests we assessed the relationship between environmental variables such as air temperature, relative air humidity, soil pH, soil moisture, canopy cover, canopy closure, habitat type (i.e., peat swamp forest, large-scale plantation, monoculture smallholding, and polyculture smallholding) and available substrata with macrofungal species richness and abundance. We sample macrofungi across four habitats on Peninsula Malaysia including peat swamp forest, large-scale plantations, monoculture smallholding and polyculture smallholding. We found that substrate richness had a positive effect on macrofungal morphospecies richness, while soil pH and air temperature had a negative effect. For macrofungal abundance, canopy closure and soil moisture had negative effects, whereas substrate richness and relative air humidity had positive effects. Our data showed considerable variation in functional group responses to environmental variables. The abundance of wood-inhabiting fungi was driven primarily by substrate richness, while relative air humidity, soil moisture, and habitat type play minor roles. The abundance of terricolous saprotrophic fungi was determined principally by habitat type, substrate richness, and relative air humidity. Macrofungal community structure was mainly influenced by substrate richness, followed by microclimates and soil characteristics. Our results can provides critical ecological data to support conservation stakeholders conserve macrofungi in natural and agricultural peatlands. Our study suggests that the expansion of oil palm monocultures, to the detriment of peat swamp forests, is likely to have negative effects on macrofungal biodiversity and further agricultural expansion should be prevented. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors},

abstract = {The influence exerted by tree communities, topography, and soil chemistry on the assembly of macrofungal communities remains poorly understood, especially in highly diverse tropical forests. Here, we used a large dataset that combines inventories of macrofungal Basidiomycetes fruiting bodies, tree species composition, and measurements for 16 soil physicochemical parameters, collected in 34 plots located in four sites of lowland rain forests in French Guiana. Plots were established on three different topographical conditions: hilltop, slope, and seasonally flooded soils. We found hyperdiverse Basidiomycetes communities, mainly comprising members of Agaricales and Polyporales. Phosphorus, clay contents, and base saturation in soils strongly varied across plots and shaped the richness and composition of tree communities. The latter composition explained 23% of the variation in the composition of macrofungal communities, probably through high heterogeneity of the litter chemistry and selective effects of biotic interactions. The high local heterogeneity of habitats influenced the distribution of both macrofungi and trees, as a result of diversed local soil hydromorphic conditions associated with contrasting soil chemistry. This first regional study across habitats of French Guiana forests revealed new niches for macrofungi, such as ectomycorrhizal ones, and illustrates how macrofungi inventories are still paramount to can be to understand the processes at work in the tropics.

These changes are likely to be paralleled by shifts in microbial community composition with potential feedbacks on ecosystem functioning. Here, we assessed fungal communities across a chronosequence of managed Pinus sylvestris stands and investigated correlations between taxonomic composition and extracellular enzyme activities. Not surprisingly, clear-cutting had a negative effect on ectomycorrhizal fungal abundance and diversity. In contrast, clear-cutting favoured proliferation of saprotrophic fungi correlated with enzymes involved in holocellulose decomposition. During stand development, the re-establishing ectomycorrhizal fungal community shifted in composition from dominance by Atheliaceae in younger stands to Cortinarius and Russula species in older stands. Late successional ectomycorrhizal taxa correlated with enzymes involved in mobilisation of nutrients from organic matter, indicating intensified nutrient limitation. Our results suggest that maintenance of functional diversity in the ectomycorrhizal fungal community may sustain long-term forest production by retaining a capacity for symbiosis-driven recycling of organic nutrient pools. {\textcopyright} 2017 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved 1751-7362/17.},

abstract = {The current requirements to decrease the consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuels have increased the demand of renewable energy sources. In forestry, this situation has intensified harvesting practices resulting in a decreased amount of woody debris left on the clear-cut areas. Impacts of energy wood harvest on wood-decomposing fungi were studied in a large-scale experiment in clear-cut stands in three geographical areas in Finland. A sequence of treatments was expected to form a forestry induced soil disturbance gradient: (1) logging residues left at site, no soil preparation; (2) logging residues left at site, patch mounding; (3) 70% logging residue removal, patch mounding; and (4) complete stump and logging residue removal, patch mounding. Pre-weighed wood discs were incubated on the intact soil cover for four years to estimate decomposition rate and fungal decomposer community. A soil sample was taken underneath each disc to evaluate the direct inoculation potential of the soil. The main results were as follows: (1) The differences between the treatments were not significant, while the geographical factors affected the decomposition rate and the fungal communities of the wood discs. (2) The fungal composition in the wood discs did not reflect the underlying soil fungal community, which indicates that a part of the fungal species inhabiting wood discs originated from airborne surrounding sources. (3) The increase in fungal species diversity was associated to the wood decay process, indicated by parallel increase in the wood decomposition rate and the number of white rot and mycorrhizal fungi. Thus our study indicates that in addition to local environment, landscape-level factors control the decomposer fungal community and its activity in wood. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Saprotrophic macrofungi are key decomposers of plant biomass in forests. These fungi form ecologically diverse group where different species specialize in specific substrates. Wildfires produce massive amounts of heterogeneous dead substrates. The postfire succession of saprotrophic fungi on these substrates may have major consequences on how carbon and nutrients are released back to forest ecosystems after a fire. We studied the effects of a wildfire (covering 143 ha) on saptroptrophic macrofungi (Basidiomycota and Ascomycota) in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) dominated forest in eastern Finland during 12 years after the wildfire. In particular, we focused on the consequences that within-fire variation in fire severity had on fungal assemblages. Twenty-two permanent sample plots (10 × 10 m2 each) were monitored annually. Plots were located on sites with four different fire severity classes and on two unburned control sites. A total of 43 102 sporocarps of macrofungi were collected. Based on fungal life histories, we separated four different groups in the analyses: (1) wood-associated fungi on decayed wood, (2) decomposers of organic matter in soil or that live on bare mineral soil in forest floor, (3) biotrophic macrofungi that are associations between algae and fungi and that may also be symbiotic with mycorrhizae fungi, and (4) parasites on a living host plant or other fungi. In total, 219 species were observed. Fire severity affected species richness and composition, and fire always increased fungal diversity in comparison with unburned control sites. On the burned sites, species richness was highest on sites of medium burn severity (114 species in total, vs. 88–106 spp. on other burned sites). Substrate association of species was closely connected to assemblage dynamics: on soil and humus substrates, the succession of fire-associated pyrophilous species was rapid when compared to the succession of aphyllophoroid wood-associated macrofungi (AWAM). Pyrophilous and AWAM assemblages comprised many indicator species that occurred only ephemerally during the few years after the fire. In previous studies, AWAM assemblages often respond negatively to forest fires in short-term. Our results, however, show that if also other than AWAM macrofungi are included, there are several species typical for immediate post-fire habitats. The role that these species have on forest ecosystem and – for example – on carbon dynamics after a wildfire remains an important topic for future studies. From the conservation viewpoint, the finding emphasizes that post-fire young successional forests are important habitats for specialized and rare fungi. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soil fungi are integral to decomposition in forests and other habitats, yet identifying probable functional roles of different taxa is problematic. Here, we compared carbohydrate assimilation patterns derived from stable isotope analyses on cultures with patterns of metabolic activity measured on Biolog{\textregistered} SF-P plates for 12 taxa of soil- and litter-inhabiting saprotrophic fungi isolated from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) ecosystems. To determine the relative assimilation of carbon from malt extract versus sucrose by 13C stable isotope analyses, we cultured fungi with malt extract (consisting primarily of glucose and maltose) plus either C3- or C4-derived sucrose as carbon sources. Rhodotorula graminis and F. oxysporum assimilated the highest proportion of sucrose, a Mortierella isolate and an unidentified sterile isolate (FPC 341) assimilated the lowest proportion of sucrose, and remaining cultures assimilated similar and intermediate proportions of sucrose. On Biolog plates, low metabolic activity of Mortierella and FPC 341 on sucrose and R. graminis and F. oxysporum on maltose were qualitatively consistent with isotopic results. Assimilation of sucrose calculated isotopically was correlated with the ratio of sucrose: maltose activity calculated from Biolog assays (r2 = 0.45, P = 0.0145, n = 12). Metabolic activity on Biolog plates for six other common soil carbohydrates were also determined: glucose, fructose, galactose, cellobiose, lactose, and glycogen. Metabolic activity was greatest overall on maltose and glucose and lowest on fructose. Two of the isolates (Aspergillus flavus and F. oxysporum) had higher metabolic activity on the glucose-containing disaccharide cellobiose than on glucose, strongly suggesting preferential uptake of cellobiose compared to glucose and suggesting the potential ability to use cellulose. The high metabolic activity of these cultures on galactose, a primary constituent of hemicellulose, also suggested cellulolytic capabilities. Our results indicated that stable isotope studies and Biolog assays may provide complementary information to characterize metabolic potential of fungi in forest litter and soil.},

abstract = {Soil-surface CO2 efflux ('soil respiration') accounts for roughly two-thirds of forest ecosystem respiration, and can be divided into heterotrophic and autotrophic components. Conventionally, the latter is defined as respiration by plant roots. In Boreal forests, however, fine roots of trees are invariably covered by ectomycorrhizal fungi, which by definition are heterotrophs, but like the roots, receive sugars derived from photosynthesis. There is also a significant leaching of labile carbon compounds from the ectomycorrhizal roots. It is, therefore, more meaningful in the context of carbon balance studies to include mycorrhizal fungi and other mycorrhizosphere organisms, dependent on the direct flux of labile carbon from photosynthesis, in the autotrophic component. Hence, heterotrophic activity becomes reserved for the decomposition of more complex organic molecules in litter and other forms of soil organic matter. In reality, the complex situation is perhaps best described as a continuum from strict autotrophy to strict heterotrophy. As a result of this, and associated methodological problems, estimates of the contribution of autotrophic respiration to total soil respiration have been highly variable. Based on recent stand-scale tree girdling experiments we have estimated that autotrophic respiration in boreal forest accounts for up to 50-65% of soil respiration during the snow-free part of the year. Girdling experiments and studies of the delta(13)C of the soil CO2 efflux show that there is a lag of a few days between the carbon uptake by photosynthesis and the release by autotrophic soil respiration of the assimilated carbon. In contrast, estimates of 'bomb 14C' and other approaches have suggested that it takes years to decades between carbon uptake via photosynthesis and the bulk of soil heterotrophic activity. Temperature is normally used as a driver in models of soil processes and it is often assumed that autotrophic soil activity is more sensitive to temperature than is heterotrophic activity, but this is questionable. It is inherently difficult to make a precise separation of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration from soils. The partitioning between these two components is highly variable in space and time, and taxonomic autotrophs and heterotrophs may perform the function of the other group to some degree. Care should be taken to disturb as little as possible the delicate plant-microbe-soil system, and this speaks for non-intrusive isotopic methods. There are, however, problems in modelling the flux of isotopes through this complex system. Girdling of tree stands is a very robust alternative approach to make the distinction between autotrophic and heterotrophic activities, but ultimately kills the trees and cannot, therefore, always be used. A further development would be to block the phloem sugar transport reversibly. We propose that thus assumption needs further critical testing.},

We applied culture-free DNA extraction and 454-pyrosequencing to study the mycobiota of decaying Norway spruce (. Picea abies) logs in five unmanaged boreal forests. Fungal habitat preferences in respect of wood density gradient were then estimated with generalized additive mixed models. Fungal diversity and wood density were inversely related, i.e., OTU richness generally increased as the log became increasingly decomposed. White-rot fungi (e.g., Phellinus nigrolimitatus) and members of Hyphodontia did not show a clear response to the wood-density gradient, whereas abundance of Phellinus viticola and brown-rot fungi (e.g., Fomitopsis pinicola, Antrodia serialis, Coniophora olivaceae) peaked during intermediate decay and mycorrhizal fungi (e.g., Piloderma, Tylospora, Russula) increased in the later stages.

abstract = {Mycorrhizal fungal necromass is increasingly recognized as an important contributor to soil organic carbon pools, particularly in forest ecosystems. While its decomposition rate is primarily determined by biochemical composition, how traits such as melanin content affect the structure of necromass decomposer communities remains poorly understood. To assess the role of biochemical traits on microbial decomposer community composition and functioning, we incubated melanized and non-melanized necromass of the mycorrhizal fungus Meliniomyces bicolor in Pinus- and Quercus-dominated forests in Minnesota, USA and then assessed the associated fungal and bacterial decomposer communities after 1, 2 and 3 months using high-throughput sequencing. Melanized necromass decomposed significantly slower than non-melanized necromass in both forests. The structure of the microbial decomposer communities depended significantly on necromass melanin content, although the effect was stronger for fungi than bacteria. On non-melanized necromass, fungal communities were dominated by r-selected ascomycete and mucoromycete microfungi early and then replaced by basidiomycete ectomycorrhizal fungi, while on melanized necromass these groups were co-dominant throughout the incubation. Bacterial communities were dominated by both specialist mycophageous and generalist taxa. Synthesis. Our results indicate that necromass biochemistry not only strongly affects rates of decomposition but also the structure of the associated decomposer communities. Furthermore, the observed colonization patterns suggest that fungi, and particularly ectomycorrhizal fungi, may play a more important role in necromass decomposition than previously recognized. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors.

abstract = {Although boreal forests are biomes which are characterized by periodical forest wildfires, very little is known about adaptations to fire in forest herbs. We investigated whether a putatively fire-dependent herbaceous species - Pulsatilla patens - demonstrated adaptive responses to environmental cues that reflect differences in pre-fire and post-fire environments (the presence of ericoid litter and charcoal, and light levels). For comparison, we included in the experiment a close congeneric species that is less bound to forest ecosystems (Pulsatilla pratensis) and a morphologically similar mesic grassland species from the same family (Ranunculus polyanthemos), as examples of species for which adaptations to fire should be of lower value, or of no value at all, respectively. The addition of ericoid litter to the soil generally enhanced plant growth, suggesting that its negative effect on plant germination and growth is not as widespread as previously thought. In both Pulsatilla species charcoal without forest litter retarded plant growth, but in combination with ericoid litter the negative effect disappeared or was even replaced by a slightly positive effect. Such an interactive effect was absent in the grassland species R. polyanthemos. The response of Pulsatilla species to different post-fire signals may be explained by adaptive down-regulation of growth after high-intensity fire - small plant size can be advantageous in sparse and well illuminated field-layer vegetation - and intense growth in the more competitive situation following weak fire. An additional experiment demonstrated that the effects of fire-related treatments were not mediated by differential AM infection. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

Mineral soil samples were collected along transects running from old-growth (OG) forests into harvested stands of ages 5, 15, and 40 years (5YS, 15YS, and 40YS, respectively) in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the central Oregon Cascade Mountains. We took litter depth measurements and cores to test for the presence of mycorrhizal mats at each sampling location. Denitrification potential was significantly lower in OG than in 5YS, and litter depth, forest floor respiration rate, and concentration of ectomycorrhizal mats were significantly greater in OG than in 5YS. Values were intermediate in 15YS and similar to those measured in OG in 40YS. No significant stand-age differences occurred in soil organic matter, soil moisture, pH, mineralizable N, laboratory soil respiration rate, or extractable ammonium. Sample variability was generally lowest in OG forests and highest in 5YS, and no consistent autocorrelations were observed for any of the variables at lags of 5 m or greater. We found no second-level interactions between stand age and location in ANOVA analyses, suggesting that, within the limits of this study, climate did not influence soil response to disturbance and subsequent recovery; however, several soil properties were affected by site location and, therefore, climate.},

abstract = {Beneficial soil microorganisms are integral to nutrient availability and uptake for plants in restoration. They include mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, together with the soil microbial populations which contribute to nutrient availability. Around 70% of jarrah forest plant species form arbuscular mycorrhizas, and approximately a quarter also form ectomycorrhizas. Many are also legumes. In addition, around 70 orchid species depend on mycorrhizal symbioses. Therefore, symbiotic soil microorganisms are important in the ecosystem. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi recover to pre-mining levels in bauxite restoration in five years. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are poorly adapted to disturbance; however, they are able to reinvade through wind-blown spores. The density of ectomycorrhizal fungi has been found to be equivalent in seven-year-old restoration and adjacent forest, but both abundance and diversity are correlated with development of a litter layer. Fortunately, rhizobia are known to be tolerant of soil disturbance, and failure of N-fixation by legumes has not been reported in restoration. Other N-fixing symbioses, such as between Allocasuarina and Franki a or Macrozamia and Nostoc, have not been investigated in restored mines. Soil microbial biomass C achieves near equivalence after about eight years and appears to be driven by vegetation productivity and related inputs of C into the soil. There is little field evidence that the absence, or very low levels, of soil microbial symbionts will have a substantial impact on plant growth in restoration. Therefore, deliberate reintroduction of these microorganisms does not appear justified. However, soil management to enhance the survival of soil biological components is recommended. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract = {In forest ecosystems, trees represent the major primary producers and affect the chemical composition and microbial processes in the ecosystem via specific litter chemistry and rhizodeposition. Effects of trees on the abundance of soil microorganisms have been previously observed but the extent to which trees affect the composition of microbial communities remains unknown. Here we analyse the factors affecting the composition of bacterial and fungal communities in forest litter and soil under seven tree species studied at twenty-eight spatially independent sites of similar age developed on the same initial substrate. Microbial communities differed between litter and soil. Bacterial communities were more diverse than fungal communities, especially in litter, and exhibited higher evenness. Eighty percent of the bacterial sequences belonged to the 200-250 most dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and 80% of the fungal sequences were composed of only 23-28 OTUs. The effect of tree species on the microbial-community composition was significant in both litter and soil for fungi as well as bacteria. In bacteria, the tree effect was likely partly mediated by litter and soil pH. Fungal taxa showed a greater tendency to be tree-specific: 35-37% of the dominant fungal OTUs but only 0-3% of the bacterial OTUs were restricted to 1 or 2 trees, and 15-45% of the fungi and 80% of the bacteria were common under 6 or 7 trees. Microbial taxa were demonstrated to associate with less trees than would be expected based on the patterns of their abundance in samples and the tree identity thus affects their occurrence. The numbers of observed dominant fungal OTUs in the study area increased faster with an increasing numbers of trees, indicating high $\beta$-diversity. Although the proportion of the arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi differed among trees, the tree-specific fungal taxa were both root-symbiotic and saprotrophic. The effect of trees on the composition of microbial community was demonstrated to be stronger than other soil properties and to explain a large proportion of variation in community composition, especially in fungi. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Mixtures of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and Acacia mearnsii de Wildeman are twice as productive as E. globulus monocultures growing on the same site in East Gippsland, Victoria, Australia, possibly because of increased nitrogen (N) availability owing to N2 fixation by A. mearnsii. To investigate whether N2 fixation by A. mearnsii could account for the mixed-species growth responses, we assessed N2 fixation by the accretion method and the 15N natural abundance method. Nitrogen gained by E. globulus and A. mearnsii mixtures and monocultures was calculated by the accretion method with plant and soil samples collected 10 years after plantation establishment. Nitrogen in biomass and soil confirmed that A. mearnsii influenced N dynamics. Assuming that the differences in soil, forest floor litter and biomass N of plots containing A. mearnsii compared with E. globulus monocultures were due to N2 fixation, the 10-year annual mean rates of N2 fixation were 38 and 86 kg ha-1 year1 in 1:1 mixtures and A. mearnsii monocultures, respectively. Nitrogen fixation by A. mearnsii could not be quantified on the basis of the natural abundance of 15N because such factors as mycorrhization type and fractionation of N isotopes during N cycling within the plant confounded the effect of the N source on the N isotopic signature of plants. This study shows that A. mearnsii fixed significant quantities of N2 when mixed with E. globulus. A decline in $\delta$15N values of E. globulus and A. mearnsii with time, from 2 to 10 years, is further evidence that N2 was fixed and cycled through the stands. The increased aboveground biomass production of E. globulus trees in mixtures when compared with monocultures can be attributed to increases in N availability. {\textcopyright} 2007 Heron Publishing.},

abstract = {Dynamics of radiocesium in wild mushrooms, especially in mycorrhizal fungi, in forest ecosystems were investigated for 5 years after the Fukushima nuclear accident, in relation to substrates such as litter, soil and wood debris. Some mushroom species contained a high level of radiocesium in the first or second year, and then the radiocesium content decreased. Changes in radiocesium activities were ambiguous for many other mushrooms. Radiocesium accumulation with time was not common contrary to expectations. Reduction of radiocesium activities in litter and increase in mushrooms and soils, i.e. transfer of radiocesium from litter to mushrooms and soils, was recognized in the first and second year, but it was not obvious in subsequent years. Radiocesium accumulated in several mushroom species, especially in mycorrhizal fungi, while radiocesium in the other mushrooms did not exceed those in the neighboring forest litter. Similar differences in radiocesium level among mushroom species were observed in relation to 40K levels, though 137Cs/40K ratio in mushrooms was lower than in O horizon, but at the same level of the A horizon in general. These facts suggested differences in the mechanisms of cesium accumulation. Residual 137Cs due to nuclear weapons tests or the Chernobyl accident still remained in mushrooms and soils. From the ratio of the past residual 137Cs, it was suggested that the residual 137Cs was tightly retained in the material cycles of forest mushroom ecosystem, whereas 137Cs emitted from the Fukushima accident was still fluid. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2019.},

To test this hypothesis, we synthesized 645 observations, including 22 variables related to below-ground C and N dynamics from 100 sites, where AM and ECM forests co-occurred at the same site. Leaf litter quality was lower in ECM than in AM trees, leading to greater forest floor C stocks in ECM forests. By contrast, AM forests had significantly higher mineral soil C concentrations, and this result was strongly mediated by plant traits and climate. No significant differences were found between AM and ECM forests in C fluxes and labile C concentrations. Furthermore, inorganic N concentrations, net N mineralization and nitrification rates were all higher in AM than in ECM forests, indicating ‘mineral' N economy in AM but ‘organic' N economy in ECM trees. AM and ECM forests show systematic differences in mineral vs organic N cycling, and thus mycorrhizal type may be useful in predicting how different tree species respond to multiple environmental change factors. By contrast, mycorrhizal type alone cannot reliably predict below-ground C dynamics without considering plant traits and climate.},

However, the exact contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to soil isotopic patterns remains unknown. In this study, we compared 13C and 15N patterns of glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), which includes a main fraction derived from AMF, litter, and bulk soil in four temperate rainforests. GRSP was an abundant C and N pool in these forest soils, showing significant 13C and 15N enrichment relative to litter and bulk soil. Hence, cumulative accumulation of recalcitrant AMF turnover products in the soil profile likely contributes to 13C and 15N enrichment in forest soils.

abstract = {Analysis of a dataset obtained from a monitoring programme at the Heron Wood Reserve (Scotland, UK), focuses on the differences in certain properties of soil and forest litter and patterns of ecosystem dynamics in plots dominated by differing vegetation types, especially the arborescent beech (Fagus sylvatica) and birch (Betula pendula x B. pubescens), and the grass Holcus lanatus. A number of properties show some considerable differences in relation to the habitats dominated by different plant species. For example, pH in the grassland and beech-dominated habitat was significantly lower than in the habitats dominated by birch and mixed vegetation. The highest soil ergosterol was found in the beech-dominated habitat, and it was significantly different from grass and birch dominated habitats. By contrast, the numbers of forest floor layer bacteria in the beech-dominated plots were significantly lower than in the other habitats. Some remarkable differences have also been found as regards forest litter composition and moisture, the community saprotrophs and sheathing mycorrhizas. The ecological patterns are further complicated by animals, and are exemplified here by discussing the role of nutrient inputs due to the mammalian droppings characterised by a succession of the coprophilous mycota. The discussion concentrates on how the dominant plant species influence the patterns of ecological interactions observed. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We investigated the structure of the fungal community of evergreen broad-leaved forests dominated by evergreen oak (Castanopsis sieboldii or Quercus myrsinaefolia) through surveying sporocarps in urban, suburban, and rural areas of the Kanto District, Japan. In a 4 year census, 132 species of fungi were recorded and classified into five groups on the basis of growth substrate: 22 litter decomposers, 39 wood rotters, 10 rotted-wood decomposers, 23 humus decomposers, and 38 ectomycorrhizal species. A long-term survey of fungi revealed lower species richness and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the urban and suburban forest than in the rural forest. The low species diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the urban forest was related to low species richness of Amanitaceae and a high frequency of some Russulaceae species such as Russula japonica. In contrast, species richness and abundance of litter decomposers and wood rotters were higher in the urban forest than in the rural forest. The uneven litter distribution on soil surfaces in the mountainous rural forest may have caused the lower species richness of litter decomposers. Rotted-wood decomposers and humus decomposers showed no significant differences among the three types of forest. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC.},

abstract = {The impact of ectomycorrhizal fungi or rhizosphere bacteria on tree seedling growth and nutrient uptake is well known. However, few studies have combined those microorganisms in one experiment to clarify their relative contribution and interactions in nutrient acquisition. Here, we monitored the respective contributions of pine roots, two ubiquitous forest ectomycorrhizal fungi Scleroderma citrinum and Laccaria bicolor, and two S. citrinum-mycorrhizosphere bacterial strains of Burkholderia glathei and Collimonas sp., on mineral weathering, nutrient uptake, and plant growth. Pinus sylvestris plants were grown on quartz-biotite substrate and inoculated or not with combinations of mycorrhizal fungi and/or bacterial strains. Magnesium and potassium fluxes were measured and nutrient budgets were calculated. Both ectomycorrhizal fungi significantly increased Mg plant uptake. No significant effects of the two bacterial strains were detected on the K and Mg budgets, but co-inoculating the mycorrhizal fungus S. citrinum and the efficient mineral-weathering B. glathei bacterial strain significantly improved the Mg budget. Similarly, co-inoculating S. citrinum with the Collimonas sp. bacterial strain significantly improved the pine biomass compared to non-inoculated pine plants. In order to better understand this process, we monitored the survival of the inoculated bacterial strains in the quartz-biotite substrate, the pine rhizosphere, and the mycorrhizal niche. The results showed that the two bacterial strains harboured different colonization behaviours both of which depended on the presence of the ectomycorrhizal partner. The populations of the Burkholderia strain were maintained in all these environments with a significantly higher density in the mycorrhizal niche, especially of S. citrinum. In contrast the population of the Collimonas strain reached the detection level except in the treatment inoculated with S. citrinum. These results highlight the need for taking into account the ecology of the microorganisms, and more specifically the fungal-bacterial interactions, when studying mineral weathering and plant nutrition. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Equilibrium and kinetic isotope fractionations during incomplete reactions result in minute differences in the ratio between the two stable N isotopes, 15SN and 14N, in various N pools. In ecosystems such variations (usually expressed in per rail [$\delta$15N]deviations from the standard atmospheric N2) depend on isotopic signatures of inputs and outputs, the input-output balance, N transformations and their specific isotope effects, and compartmentation of N within the system. Products along a sequence of reactions, e.g. the N mineralization-N uptake pathway, should, if fractionation factors were equal for the different reactions, become progressively depleted. However, fractionation factors vary. For example, because nitrification discriminates against 15N in the substrate more than does N mineralization, NH4+ can become isotopically heavier than the organic N from which it is derived. Levels of isotopic enrichment depend dynamically on the stoichiometry of reactions, as well as on specific abiotic and biotic conditions. Thus, the $\delta$15N of a specific N pool is not a constant, and $\delta$15N of a N compound added to the system is not a conservative, unchanging tracer. This fact, together with analytical problems of measuring $\delta$15N in small and dynamic pools of N in the soil-plant system, and the complexity of the N cycle itself (for instance the abundance of reversible reactions), limit the possibilities of making inferences based on observations of 15N abundance in one or a few pools of N in a system. Nevertheless, measurements of $\delta$15N might offer the advantage of giving insights into the N cycle without disturbing the system by adding 15N tracer. Such attempts require, however, that the complex factors affecting $\delta$15N in plants be taken into account, viz. (i) the source(s) of N (soil, precipitation, NO(x), NH3, N2-fixation), (ii) the depth(s) in soil from which N is taken up, (iii) the form(s) of soil-N used (organic N, NH4+, No8-), (iv) influences of mycorrhizal symbioses and fractionations during and after N uptake by plants, and (v) interactions between these factors and plant phenology. Because of this complexity, data on $\delta$15N can only be used alone when certain requirements are met, e.g. when a clearly discrete N source in terms of amount and isotopic signature is studied. For example, it is recommended that N in non-N2-fixing species should differ more than 5‰ from N derived by N2-fixation, and that several non-N2-fixing references are used, when data on $\delta$15N are used to estimate N2-fixation in poorly described ecosystems. As well as giving information on N source effects, $\delta$15N can give insights into N cycle rates. For example, high levels of N deposition onto previously N-limited systems leads to increased nitrification, which produces 15N-enriched NH4+ and 15N-depleted NO3-. As many forest plants prefer NH4+ they become enriched in 15N in such circumstances. This change in plant $\delta$15N will subsequently also occur in the soil surface horizon after litter-fall, and might be a useful indicator of N saturation, especially since there is usually an increase in $\delta$15N with depth in soils of N-limited forests. Generally, interpretation of 15N measurements requires additional independent data and modelling, and benefits from a controlled experimental setting. Modelling will be greatly assisted by the development of methods to measure the $\delta$15N of small dynamic pools of N in soils. Direct comparisons with parallel low tracer level 15N studies will be necessary to further develop the interpretation of variations in $\delta$15N in soil-plant systems. Another promising approach is to study ratios of 15N:14N together with other pairs of stable isotopes, e.g. 13C:12C or 18O: 16O, in the same ion or molecules. This approach can help to tackle the challenge of distinguishing isotopic source effects from fractionations within the system studied.},

abstract = {Assessing the Impact of the Rise in CO2: A doubling of the present atmospheric CO2 concentration is likely to occur by the end of the next century and will have many effects on trees and forests. There may be major changes in climate, especially temperature and precipitation, that will affect the growth and ecology of trees and forests: there will be substantial effects on the growth and ecology of trees and forests as a result of the direct effects of CO2 on the physiology of trees. To a considerable extent the consequences of an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration on climate are speculative, whereas many of the direct effects of an increase in CO2 concentration on the physiology and growth of plants have been established through experimentation and are quite well known and understood. There are several reasons for showing active concern about the consequences of the rise in CO2 concentration for trees and forests: to enhance knowledge, at a fundamental level, about the functioning of woodlands and forests; to assess the likely impact on their ecology, productivity and value; and to anticipate any significant downstream, socio-economic consequences. The consequences of the rise in CO2 concentration may be assessed at a range of temporal and spatial scales: from seconds to centuries, from cell to region. Biological information about the effects of CO2 on plants is generally available at short time scales and small spatial scales, whereas ecological and socio-economic concern is largely expressed with respect to the much larger scales of the stand and the forest over tens or hundreds of years. There are major problems with the data currently available. The environmental conditions pertaining in the majority of the experiments (e.g. soil type, temperature) differ significantly from forest conditions throughout the boreal and temperate regions. Secondly, the use of juvenile trees in growth cabinets and rooms makes extrapolation to the field situation difficult. Finally, the use to pot-grown plants with a limited soil volume, and all the problems of nutrient depletion that this entails, imposes severe constraints on the interpretations of changes in plant nutrient contents, assimilation rates and growth. Photosynthesis and Stomatal Action: The primary role of CO2 as a substrate for photosynthesis is well understood and there are no reasons to suppose that effects of CO2 concentration on the primary carboxylation are any different in trees from other plants with the C3 pathway. However, the role of CO2 as an effective activator and regulator of rubisco is only currently being unravelled. In general, photosynthesis increases substantially, but less than proportionately (up to 75%), in response to a doubling in ambient CO2 concentration, but a lack of response, or even a reduction in rate of photosynthesis, has been observed. There is increasing evidence that maintenance of active sinks for assimilate is necessary for the effective stimulation of photosynthesis by an increase in CO2 concentration. Constrained rooting of pot-grown trees and the lack of alternative sinks as a result of determinate growth, may be the reason why a strong, positive response has not always been seen and why the assimilation rate declines with time in many of the experiments. Closure of stomata in response to stress may also negate the increase from CO2 fertilization. When plants are grown for extended periods in elevated CO2 so that they may become acclimated, the increase in rate of photosynthesis is less than in short-term experiments. Analysis of A/Ci response functions indicates that this may result from a reduction in the activity of rubisco, although it is not clear whether the amount or the activation state of the enzyme is reduced, or from Pi limitation. Stomatal conductance generally declines with an increase in CO2 concentration to between 0 to 70% of the control. There is considerable variation in response and in some trees, particularly conifers, stomatal conductance is rather unresponsive to changes in ambient CO2 concentration. The lack of a mechanistic understanding of the role of CO2 in stomatal action prevents explanation at present. There is some evidence that a reduction in the number of stomata per unit area or per unit epidermal cell may also contribute to the reduction in stomatal conductance of plants grown at high CO2 concentrations, but both increases and decreases have been observed in trees. It is not clear whether these changes are the result of acclimation of developmental processes, ecological selection or genetic adaptation. There may be other presently unknown effects of CO2 concentration on growth processes at the cellular level. In particular, the effects of CO2 concentration on leaf growth may not be explicable solely in terms of substrate supply and there may be effects of CO2 on leaf initiation, development and expansion in other ways. Tree Growth: Growth of seedlings and young trees of both broadleaves and conifers is increased by a doubling of the ambient CO2 concentration. The observed magnitude of the response ranges from 20 to 120% with a median of ca 40%. Both root and shoot growth are increased. Young trees grow faster in high CO2 but normal ontogenetic processes occur. In general, the experiments suffer from a number of inadequacies and this may explain the variability of response. In particular nearly all the experiments have been short-term (less than 12 months) on very young trees, that are often pot-bound and with growth restricted by lack of sinks and in a nutrient-deficient condition. Very low relative growth rates indicate far from good growth conditions. Increases in growth in response to increase in CO2 concentration occur in stress conditions and can ameliorate to a large extent the influence of stresses (water, nutrient, low light) on growth. Nutrient deficiency enhances biomass partitioning to the roots, whereas with free nutrient supply, an increase in CO2 concentration leads to a relative enhancement of leaf growth. Acclimation to nutrient depletion, evident as increased nutrient use efficiency, may occur but its extent and long-term significance remains uncertain. Enhanced fine-root mass and increased mycorrhizal infection may be significant in this respect, in addition to changes in root uptake processes. The combination of enhanced assimilation and reduced stomatal condutance at elevated CO2 leads to an increase in water use efficiency at the leaf and seedling scales in controlled environments, but it is not known whether this occurs at the stand scale in the field. Because trees are perennial, a small increase in relative growth rate of 0.1% per day, at the prevailing low growth rates in many of the experiments, should lead to a large difference in individual tree size after a number of years. Whether CO2 fertilization will have this effect is however, uncertain. A major gap in our knowledge is related to the influence of elevated CO2 levels on yield quality (wood density, knottiness, etc.). Stand Processes and Production: The experimental approach is not practical with older trees, stands and forests. The effects of CO2 on assimilation, water use and other processes at the stand or larger scales, can only be assessed through models. Models of stand processes in relation to a doubling of CO2 concentration, taking into account acclimation to CO2 at the leaf scale, indicate a substantial increase in stand CO2-assimilation and in water use efficiency. However, the information available to parameterize such models may not be appropriate because it has been derived from seedlings that were only partially acclimated. Experimentation on mature trees is technically feasible but logistically and financially difficult. A more feasible approach available may be to use portions of mature trees, such as branches, in large cuvettes to obtain data required for the parameterization of stand-scale models that are used to make predictions of the likely consequences of the increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration for stand functioning. Micro-meteorological changes within the cuvettes and changes in feedback loops between the enclosed portion and the atmosphere, must, of course, be taken into account as well as the physiological consequences of treating only part of the plant. Such models require to be carefully tested at the present CO2 concentration and in relation to other environmental variables, since they cannot be tested in a doubled CO2 environment in forests. Changes in tree canopy structure may also influence canopy functioning as well as understorey species composition and growth: changes in the pattern of branching and in internode length, as a result of enhanced CO2 concentrations, have been observed, for example. However, models that include feedbacks such as interactions between CO2 and crown structure, growth and respiration of trees, or leaf composition and rates of litter decomposition, are not presently available. Whether changes in harvest index and wood quality will ensue at the stand scale cannot be predicted at present. Forest and Region: At larger scales, a very complex network of processes must be taken into consideration and there is quite insufficient information about the effects of CO2 on these processes to permit reasonable predictions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Conversion of tropical forests into intensely managed plantations is a threat to ecosystem functions. On Sumatra, Indonesia, oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations are rapidly expanding, displacing rain forests and extensively used rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforests. Here, we tested the influence of land use systems on root traits including chemical traits (carbon, nitrogen, mineral nutrients, potentially toxic elements [aluminium, iron] and performance traits (root mass, vitality, mycorrhizal colonization). Traits were measured as root community-weighed traits (RCWTs) in lowland rain forests, in rubber agro-forests mixed with rain forest trees, in rubber and oil palm plantations in two landscapes (Bukit Duabelas and Harapan, Sumatra). We hypothesized that RCWTs vary with land use system indicating increasing transformation intensity and loss of ecosystem functions. The main factors found to be related to increasing transformation intensity were declining root vitality and root sulfur, nitrogen, carbon, manganese concentrations and increasing root aluminium and iron concentrations as well as increasing spore densities of arbuscular mycorrhizas. Mycorrhizal abundance was high for arbuscular and low for ectomycorrhizas and unrelated to changes in RCWTs. The decline in RCWTs showed significant correlations with soil nitrogen, soil pH and litter carbon. Thus, our study uncovered a relationship between deteriorating root community traits and loss of ecosystem functionality and showed that increasing transformation intensity resulted in decreasing root nutrition and health. Based on these results we suggest that land management that improves root vitality may enhance the ecological functions of intense tropical production systems. {\textcopyright} 2015 Sahner et al.},

abstract = {Previous research from the tropics indicates that AMF may be well adapted to organic soils and even represent the dominant mycorrhizal form, though the extraradical part of the symbiosis was omitted as in most other tropical studies. Our study aims at characterizing the extraradical part of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in a highly organic tropical montane forest soil in Southern Ecuador. Based on recent studies on the interaction of AM fungal hyphae and litter we hypothesized that within the organic layer AM hyphae grow in close contact with decomposing material. To test this idea, AM fungal hyphal distribution in the organic layer was determined by directly staining roots and decomposing leaves and extracting hyphae from the remaining particulate organic material. AM and non-AM fungal hyphae were analyzed, as well as root colonization patterns. Our results showed that AMF indeed represented the dominant mycorrhizal form with an average root colonization of 43%. The extraradical AM hyphal length ranged from 2 to 34mg-1 soil with a mean of 10.4mg-1 soil (equals 3.1mcm-3 soil), and therefore exceeded root length about 13-fold. As hypothesized, 29% of AM extraradical hyphae were closely attached to decomposing leaves. These hyphae were mainly located at the leaf surface, though in some parts leaf veins and inner leaf tissues were colonized. More than half of AM hyphal biomass was detected on the root surface, a pattern potentially driven by the predominant Paris-type AMF. Non-AM fungal hyphae colonized decomposing material to a significantly greater extent, though hyphal length attached to roots was equal. This study supports the adaptation of AMF to highly organic soils in the tropics and the existence of a widespread extraradical mycelium, which is not readily detectable by standard methods. The close association with decomposing leaves most likely improves direct nutrient uptake from decomposed material and points to a potential indirect contribution of AMF to the decomposition process. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Forests around the world are increasingly fragmented, and edge effects on forest microclimates have the potential to affect ecosystem functions such as carbon and nutrient cycling. Edges tend to be drier and warmer due to the effects of insolation, wind, and evapotranspiration and these gradients can penetrate hundreds of metres into the forest. Litter decomposition is a key component of the carbon cycle, which is largely controlled by saprotrophic fungi that respond to variation in temperature and moisture. However, the impact of forest fragmentation on litter decay is poorly understood. Here, we investigate edge effects on the decay of wood in a temperate forest using an experimental approach, whereby mass loss in wood blocks placed along 100 m transects from the forest edge to core was monitored over 2 years. Decomposition rate increased with distance from the edge, and was correlated with increasing humidity and moisture content of the decaying wood, such that the decay constant at 100 m was nearly twice that at the edge. Mean air temperature decreased slightly with distance from the edge. The variation in decay constant due to edge effects was larger than that expected from any reasonable estimates of climatic variation, based on a published regional model. We modelled the influence of edge effects on the decay constant at the landscape scale using functions for forest area within different distances from edge across the UK. We found that taking edge effects into account would decrease the decay rate by nearly one quarter, compared with estimates that assumed no edge effect. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Seedlings of both plant species were planted so that they could become colonized by the mycorrhizal network or remain uncolonized, and were planted in the presence of a conspecific or heterospecific adult plant. After 2 years of growth, seedlings were harvested and biomass and nutrient content were determined. Biomass of A. triphyllum seedlings was not affected by the identity of the adult plant or colonization by mycorrhizal fungi. Biomass of M. racemosum seedlings was significantly affected by adult plant identity and mycorrhizal colonization. Maianthemum racemosum seedlings grown near a conspecific adult were significantly larger than when grown near a heterospecific adult, and mycorrhizal M. racemosum seedlings grown near a heterospecific adult had significantly less biomass than nonmycorrhizal seedlings. This suggests that the mycorrhizal network of some plants may confer positive or negative effects on mycorrhizal seedlings as compared to nonmycorrhizal seedlings.},

abstract = {Positive relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are reported in many studies. The underlying mechanisms are, however, only little understood, likely due to the focus on the aboveground system and neglecting species-specific traits. We used different clusters of tree species composition to investigate how tree species diversity and tree species identity affect belowground nematode communities. Since soil nematodes comprise different trophic groups and are strongly linked to the microbial community, results can provide insight on how soil food webs are structured. In addition, data on leaf litter and fine root biomass were included to account for different effects of aboveground and belowground resources. Clusters of three trees of one, two and three species were identified within a temperate deciduous forest. Target tree species were European beech (Fagus sylvatica), common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and lime (Tilia cordata, T. platyphyllos) differing in physiology, leaf litter quality and type of mycorrhiza. Tree species identity strongly affected nematode trophic structure, whereas tree species diversity had no impact. Ash beneficially affected bacterial-feeding nematodes, whereas fungal feeders were suppressed, likely caused by ash litter increasing soil pH. Fostering of the bacterial food chain by ash additionally could be related to rhizodeposition gaining importance after disappearance of high quality ash litter in spring, highlighting seasonal shifts in root and leaf litter-derived resources. The negative effect of ash on fungal-feeding nematodes is suggested to be due to the lack of ectomycorrhizal fungi as ash roots only form arbuscular mycorrhiza. In contrast, beech benefited fungal feeders and detrimentally affected bacterial feeders due to more acidic soil conditions that increase the competitive strength of fungi. Lime tended to negatively impact total nematode density but positively influenced plant-feeding nematodes. Generally, beech and ash strongly but opposingly influenced the trophic structure of nematode communities suggesting that changes in tree species identity result in major shifts in the channeling of energy through decomposer food webs. The results indicate that the structure of soil food webs varies markedly with tree species and point to the importance of basal resources, i.e., leaf litter and rhizodeposits. This suggests bottom-up forces mediated by individual tree species to control major decomposition pathways rather than tree diversity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We manipulated the number of saprotrophic fungi in either a complex multi-resource substratum (sterilized forest soil), or a single-resource substratum (powdered cellulose). The substrates were inoculated with five common species of soil fungi in all possible combinations (from monocultures to five species in combination). In both substrates, the rate of organic matter decomposition was positively associated with species richness. The effect of fungal diversity was much stronger in the uniform single-resource substrate (r2 = 0.455, P < 0.0001) than in soil (r2 = 0.154, P < 0.0001). The results document that species richness of microbial decomposers strongly affects decomposition processes, at least at the species poor end of the diversity gradient. Both, 'sampling effect' and 'species complementarity effect' contributed to the community response with the latter being much more pronounced in uniform substrate than in soil. This indicates that facilitative interactions are more important than resource partitioning for positive effects of species richness. {\textcopyright}2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Dry forest restoration success could be strongly dependent on the re-establishment of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities. AM fungi directly influence growth of a great variety of plant species by increasing nutrient uptake and providing a network of nutrient distribution for the whole plant community. Our study focuses on how different ecological restoration techniques could influence AM fungal communities in restored dry forests in the Brazilian Caatinga. The study was conducted at the National Forest of A{\c{c}}u, northeastern Brazil. AM fungal communities were studied in a restoration experiment studying the effects of litter transposition, irrigation and agroforestry treatments in comparison with a control (no manipulation) and samples collected from a conserved area (Caatinga pristine woodland) and in a regeneration area (herbaceous vegetation). Total abundance of glomerospores, number of viable glomerospores, species richness and species composition of glomerospore communities were compared among all conditions. We also investigated how soil nutrients could relate to the number of viable glomerospores in the restoration treatments. Litter treatment was the most effective in improving the AM fungal communities, showing a higher number of glomerospores than the control treatment. Litter treatment also had a greater species similarity to the conserved area among all treatments. Irrigation lead to an increase in soil salinization, which was related to a decrease in glomerospore abundance. However, in the highly irrigated agroforestry treatment there was an increase in the abundance of viable glomerospores in relation to the control treatment. Organic matter and calcium were positively correlated with the number of viable glomerospores while sodium was negatively related, showing that soil salinity could affect AM fungal community structure. Our study shows that litter transposition and agroforestry treatments are promising techniques to re-establish mycorrhizal communities during dry forest restoration. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract = {The effects of two year's addition of simulated acid precipitation, with and without added fertilizer, on mycorrhizae, litter decomposition and soil and tree chemistry in a sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) dominated forest were investigated. The forest floor beneath mature sugar maple trees was irrigated at monthly intervals between May and September with local lake water acidified to pH 3, pH 4 or untreated lakewater of pH 4.9. In addition, a commercial organic slow-release fertilizer (Maple Gro) was added to the soil prior to irrigation with pH 3 spray. Trees to which no experimental spray was applied were also included as controls. Eight trees were used for each of the five treatments. Application of the acid spray alone did not acidify surface soil nor cause visible symptoms of decline in trees. The pH of the soil solution and soil leachate was increased by addition of acidified lakewater. An increase in the concentration of sulphate (SO42-), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) in soil leachate was only recorded in plots irrigated with water acidified to pH 3 + Maple Gro. The initial rate of litter decomposition tended to be higher following application of the acid sprays, although mycorrhizal infection of sugar maple roots was reduced in the pH 3 and pH 4 treatments. Concentrations of zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) were highest in wood formed during the period irrigated with water acidified to pH 3. Foliar nitrogen (N) concentrations tended to be higher in all irrigated treatments, although there were no differences between treatment in any of the other nutrients measured in foliage after two years of treatment. It is concluded that the application of simulated acid rain under field conditions results in a complex interaction of events which are not reproduced in pot trials and must be fully understood before the impact of acid rain on sugar maple forests can be evaluated.},

abstract = {Gondwanan vegetation, and the Australian region in particular, is species rich for ectomycorrhizal fungi in epigeous and hypogeous forms with over 100 species recorded in small (1 ha) patches of forests. Distinguishing co-occurring ectomycorrhizal fungi as root associations in native (natural or wildlands) vegetation or plantations and discriminating them from other larger basidiomycetes, e.g. wood and leaf litter decomposer fungi, places large demands on molecular identification, especially if interspecific similarities and intraspecific variation occur in target sequences. One hundred and nine species of larger basidiomycetes from a single forest location were characterised by PCR-RFLP profiles of two genomic regions (nuclear rDNA ITS and mtLSU). Over one-third of the species for which multiple isolates were tested showed intraspecific variation in either one or both genomic regions. This remarkably high variation questions previous assumptions about intraspecific ITS sequence variation and highlights the value of integrated molecular and morphological databases including voucher specimens. It also emphasises the value of molecular investigations that use more than one genomic region. Interspecific similarities were common among the Cortinariaceae, especially in the ITS region. Discrimination of most Cortinariaceae species was achieved using variation in the mtLSU region in conjunction with the ITS. This new information raises the possibilities that the ITS sequence is more conserved and the mtLSU more variable than among species of the other 23 families. In the other families, interspecific ITS variation was greater and the mtLSU profiles grouped species within families. The high variation in the two genomic regions indicated possible differences in the fungal population structure between two adjacent, differently managed blocks of Eucalyptus marginata forest. The significance of this variation to ecology, biodiversity assessment and ecosystem management are discussed.},

abstract = {The fungal community in coniferous forest soils plays a pivotal role in ecosystem processes such as decomposition and carbon and nutrient cycling. Both saprotrophic (SP) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi occur throughout the upper soil horizons in coniferous forests and could therefore be exposed to high concentrations of monoterpenes occurring in the needle litter and roots of some tree species. Previous work has noted the differential effects of monoterpenes on the mycelial growth of a range of both SP and ECM fungi when grown in artificial nutrient media. This study used a novel experimental system to assess the effect of environmentally relevant concentrations of monoterpenes on the activity of ECM and SP fungi grown on more natural substrata. Exposure of the ECM fungus Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr. to vapours of either $\alpha$-pinene or $\beta$-pinene resulted in a significantly greater proportion of root tips being colonised by the fungus when it was grown with seedlings of Picea abies (L.) Karst. Exposure to monoterpenes resulted in a significant decrease in respiration rate of two species of litter degrading SP fungi, Mycena galopus var. candida J. E. Lange and Collybia butyracea (Bull.) P. Kumm. There was no difference in response between the two SP species, despite the fact that previous tests in liquid nutrient media, with monoterpenes at higher concentrations, indicated that one species was sensitive and one was not. The high volatility and low solubility of monoterpenes in water make them challenging to work with. The experimental system developed here, although still artificial, provides a bridge between pure culture studies in defined media and all the complexities of forest soils in the field, by allowing the exposure of fungi to environmentally relevant monoterpene concentrations in more natural substrata. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Sporocarp $\delta$13C identified Sistotrema confluens as ectomycorrhizal, as suspected previously from morphological characteristics. Saprotrophic $\delta$13C declined by 2 ‰-13 ‰ between ambient to elevated CO2 treatments and corresponded to different carbon sources, including surface litter (Rhodocollybia, Mycena), pine cones (Baeospora), wood (Gymnopilus, Pholiota), and soil (Ramariopsis). Ectomycorrhizal fungi, foliage, and surficial litter declined 12 ‰ in $\delta$13C between ambient and elevated treatments, confirming that these fungi depend on recent photosynthate. The $\delta$13C of ectomycorrhizal genera correlated between treatments with a slope (4.3 ± 1.2) greater than the expected value of one. This suggested that Inocybe and Cortinarius incorporated some pre-treatment, soil-derived carbon (presumably from amino acids) whereas Lactarius and Russula only incorporated current-year photosynthate or recent, litter-derived carbon. Combining natural abundance and tracer 13C measurements proved a powerful technique to examine carbon sources of different fungi. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.},

Most forest-derived species were hydrophobic. The drought-resistant Cenococcum geophilum and the more ruderal and moisture-dependent Thelephora terrestris were both strongly hydrophilic. The hydrophobic mycelium seemed solely responsible for the water repellence properties, and adjacent soil and plant debris remained unaffected and hydrophilic. In hydrophobic fungi, mat formation was induced in the rhizoscope by hyphal contact with alder litter leaves. This stimulating effect was not found when the leaves were covered by water or when fresh, green alder leaves were used. Thelephora terrestris did not form such mats in vitro and spread sparsely in air pockets as well as in the adjacent water film. The possibility is discussed that many mycorrhizal fungi in the forest may partly control their soil environment via aeration created by their hydrophobia. {\textcopyright} 1991 Springer-Verlag.},

Our study site was located on the slopes of Yulong Snow Mountain, Yunnan, China. We analyzed the effect of litter, tree roots, and the organic horizon on soil microbial communities, using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and by monitoring any changes in soil properties, over two months. Our results showed that the gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria ratio (G+/G-), after the second month of all treatments, was significantly higher than after the first month of treatment. The biomass of the soil microbial community is sensitive to response to variation of the soil environment. Removal of the organic horizon and additional litter coverage significantly decreased the biomass of fungi, fungi/bacteria and total PLFA, and significantly increased the G+/G- ratio compared with the control and other treatments after two months. Organic horizon and litter layer removal significantly increased the G+/G- ratio. Litter removal significantly increased the biomass of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

Comparative observations were made on changing light requirement with age. The species varied from shrubs and treelets (Urophyllum) via small to medium-height trees (Ficus, Pternandra) to tall trees (Gynotroches and Pellacalyx). In general, the shorter species fruited in deep shade while the taller needed direct irradiance. All produced ripe fruit at least once a year. In 1-3% isf seedling mortality over 11 months was 24% for Urophyllum hirsutum and 57% for Pternandra echinata (two strongly shade-tolerant species); survivors produced appreciable new stem and leaf tissue. For two more light-demanding species (Ficus grossularioides and F. fistulosa) mean lamina area was much larger in small gaps (10% isf) than in the understorey (<3% isf), while for Urophyllum hirsutum it was much smaller. These three species showed the greatest difference in SLA. There were few significant intraspecific differences between gaps and understorey in concentrations of N, P or K. In a valley where there was no significant difference in isf between a path and adjacent understorey, seedlings of species with seeds <1 mg mean dry mass were five times as dense on transects along steep pathside banks as in the understorey 5 m upslope. The mean mid-bank slope was 66°(cf. 20 upslope). On mid-bank transects litter had a cover of 36% (cf. 95% upslope), and was thinner (0.8 vs 3.2 cm). The soil at 0-7 cm depth into the mid bank had much lower concentrations of organic matter, total N and P (but not total K) and fine roots than that of upslope transects. All species were found to have vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza when 1-2 m tall in deep shade, several having very dense infections.

Respiration, N mineralization, chitinase activity, and amino sugar C and N turnover are higher in soils colonized by ectomycorrhizal mats. To test if microbial activity in mat soil is driven by decomposition of fungal biomass, we incubated mat and non-mat soil with 13C 15N-labeled, chitinenriched fungal cell wall material. Cell wall material was readily decomposed during 22-d incubations in both soils, and cell-wall-derived 13C and 15N were traced into mineralized pools, extractable organic pools, microbial biomass, and microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Basal microbial activity was higher in mat soils. Although total respiration was higher in mat soils with cell walls added, more cell wall C was mineralized in non-mat than mat soils; this was inferred to reflect greater preferential respiration of cell wall C over soil organic matter (SOM). Mineralization of N from cell wall material was low, with no difference between soils, and positive priming of N mineralization from SOM occurred after 3 wk. Both the proportion of cell wall N assimilated and N growth yield efficiency (GYE) were higher than for cell wall C. The relative abundance of fungi was higher in cell-wall-amended soils, and cellwall- derived 13C was found in fungal and Gram-negative bacterial PLFAs. Cell wall C assimilation and C GYE were higher in mat soils, which could be linked to greater mineralization of SOM or to differential activity of select microbial taxonomic groups. Chitin-rich fungal cell wall material was utilized as both a microbial N and C source; N was predominantly assimilated and C was predominantly metabolized. It is possible that fungal necromass may contribute to N stabilization in these soils. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Soil Science Society of America, Inc.},

abstract = {Though typically discussed in the context of salinity, a shortage of sodium in tropical forests has been demonstrated in recent years, inhibiting soil biota with impacts on decomposition processes (Sodium Ecosystem Respiration hypothesis). So far, sodium limitation has been shown for soil fauna, whereas a potential role in saprotrophic fungi remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that fungi have sodium demands at low levels resulting in reduced activity in tropical soils, analyzing fungal responses to sodium availability. Despite careful experimentation and the usage of different fungal strains we did not find evidence for fungal sodium demands using controlled nutrient media, not even in the absence of potassium. Likewise, there was no significant fungal response to sodium additions in litter samples, though decomposition rates were positively affected. These findings suggest that sodium is not essential for osmoregulation of tested fungal strains, which are hence not affected by sodium limitation.},

abstract = {Fungal colonization of litter has been described mostly in terms of fructification succession in the decomposition process or the process of fungal ligninolysis. No studies have been conducted on litter colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and their relationship with the presence of saprotrophic fungi. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationships that exist in simultaneous leaf litter colonization by AMF and saprotrophic fungi and the relationships between rates of litter and associated root colonization by AMF at different soil depths. We selected Eugenia sp. and Syzygium sp. in a riparian tropical forest, with an abundant production of litter (O horizon), we evaluated litter and root colonization at different depths, its C:N ratios, and the edaphic physico-chemical parameters of the A horizon immediately below the litter layer. Litter colonization by saprotrophic fungi and AMF increased with depth, but the saprotrophic fungal colonization of some litter fragments decreased in the lowermost level of the litter while AMF litter colonization continued to increase. Plant roots were present only in the middle and bottom layers, but their mycorrhizal colonization did not correlate with litter colonization. The external hyphae length of AMF is abundant (ca. 20 m g -1 sample) and, in common with sample humidity, remained constant with increasing depth. We conclude that in zones of riparian tropical forest with abundant sufficient litter accumulation and abundant AMF external hyphae, the increase in litter colonization by AMF with depth correlates to the colonization by saprotrophic fungi, but their presence in the deepest layers is independent of both litter colonization by saprotrophic fungi and root colonization by AMF. {\textcopyright} 2012 The British Mycological Society.},

abstract = {Roots promote the formation of slow-cycling soil carbon (C), yet we have a limited understanding of the magnitude and controls on this flux. We hypothesised arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)- and ectomycorrhizal (ECM)-associated trees would exhibit differences in root-derived C accumulation in the soil, and that much of this C would be transferred into mineral-associated pools. We installed $\delta$13C-enriched ingrowth cores across mycorrhizal gradients in six Eastern U.S. forests (n = 54 plots). Overall, root-derived C was 54% greater in AM versus ECM-dominated plots. This resulted in nearly twice as much root-derived C in putatively slow-cycling mineral-associated pools in AM compared to ECM plots. Given that our estimates of root-derived inputs were often equal to or greater than leaf litter inputs, our results suggest that variation in root-derived soil C accumulation due to tree mycorrhizal dominance may be a key control of soil C dynamics in forests. {\textcopyright} 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Plant roots and their mycorrhizal symbionts are critical components of forest ecosystems, being largely responsible for soil resource acquisition by plants and the maintenance of soil structure, as well as influencing soil nutrient cycling. Silvicultural treatments should be guided by knowledge of how these below-ground components respond to different forest management practices. 2. We examined the cumulative effects of 20 years of prescribed burning at 2-year intervals. We measured fine root length density and fine root and mycorrhizal root biomass in the upper 15 cm of mineral soil in a south-western ponderosa pine forest over a complete burn cycle. 3. Repeated burning reduced fine root length, fine root biomass and mycorrhizal root biomass, as well as the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus stored in these below-ground pools. 4. Estimates of fine root production, fine root decomposition and nutrient dynamics were similar in burned and control plots. 5. Synthesis and applications. Although repeated-prescribed fire may be an effective, low-cost approach for reducing fuel loads and lessening the chance of a catastrophic wildfire in ponderosa pine forests, our results suggest that this strategy may negatively affect below-ground biomass pools and nutrient cycling processes in the long term. We recommend that mechanical reductions in fuel loads be conducted in these and similar forests that have not experienced fire for decades, before fire is reintroduced as a management tool. {\textcopyright} 2005 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Increased soil nitrogen (N) from atmospheric N deposition could change microbial communities and functions. However, the underlying mechanisms and whether soil phosphorus (P) status are responsible for these changes still have not been well explained. Here, we investigated the effects of N and P additions on soil bacterial and fungal communities and predicted their functional compositions in a temperate forest. We found that N addition significantly decreased soil bacterial diversity in the organic (O) horizon, but tended to increase bacterial diversity in the mineral (A) horizon soil. P addition alone did not significantly change soil bacterial diversity but mitigated the negative effect of N addition on bacterial diversity in the O horizon. Neither N addition nor P addition significantly influenced soil fungal diversity. Changes in soil microbial community composition under N and P additions were mainly due to the shifts in soil pH and NO3− contents. N addition can affect bacterial functional potentials, such as ureolysis, N fixation, respiration, decomposition of organic matter processes, and fungal guilds, such as pathogen, saprotroph, and mycorrhizal fungi, by which more C probably was lost in O horizon soil under increased N deposition. However, P addition can alleviate or switch the effects of increased N deposition on the microbial functional potentials in O horizon soil and may even be a benefit for more C sequestration in A horizon soil. Our results highlight the different responses of microorganisms to N and P additions between O and A horizons and provides an important insight for predicting the changes in forest C storage status under increasing N deposition in the future. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

abstract = {Increases in carbon (C) inputs can augment soil organic matter (SOM), or reduce SOM by accelerating decomposition. Thus, there is a need to understand how and why ecosystems differ in their sensitivity to C inputs. Invasive plants that invade wide-ranging habitats, accumulate biomass rapidly, and contribute copious amounts of C to soil can be ideal for addressing this gap. We quantified the effects of the invasive C4 grass, Microstegium vimineum, on SOM in three temperate forests across plots varying in their relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) versus ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees. We hypothesized that invasion would differentially affect SOM along the mycorrhizal gradient owing to recognized patterns in nitrogen availability (AM > ECM) and the proportion of unprotected SOM (ECM > AM). Across all sites, M. vimineum was associated with lower particulate organic matter (POM) in ECM-dominated plots, consistent with our hypothesis that invader-derived C inputs should stimulate decomposers to acquire nitrogen from unprotected SOM in soils with low nitrogen availability. However, the pattern of lower POM in the ECM-dominated soils was offset by greater mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM)—and isotopic data suggest this was largely driven by native- rather than invader-derived SOM—implying an invasion-associated transfer of native-derived POM into MAOM. Our results demonstrate a context-dependent shift in the form of SOM in a system with presumably enhanced C inputs. This finding suggests a need to look beyond changes in total SOM stocks, as intrinsic SOM changes could lead to important long-term feedbacks on invasion or priming effects. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

We used high resolution rDNA techniques to identify ectomycorrhiza-forming fungi and attempted to extract potential stand-, gap-, soil-, and selected environmentally derived variables by applying multivariate analysis and ordination for pooling of ecological groups of ectomycorrhiza. A significant reduction of diversity indices, ectomycorrhizal and fine root dynamics, in gaps in comparison with closed canopy stands indicates an effect of forest management practice and the high importance of maintaining and protecting natural forest areas for conservation of soil biodiversity and forest genetic resources. The ordination analysis revealed three groups of ectomycorrhiza correlated with changing environmental conditions. The litter and soil pH, number of beech seedlings, and presence of a gap had a pronounced effect on the ectomycorrhizal community. Combined analysis of ectomycorrhiza and environmental factors using correspondence analysis provided an insight into the ecological preferences of the analysed species and confirmed that environmental factors drive ectomycorrhizal community changes.},

It is important to understand the environmental controls on soil CO2 efflux, in order to evaluate potential responses of ecosystems to climate change. This study investigated the relationship between total soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature, soil moisture and solar radiation on an interannual basis for a plot of temperate deciduous ancient semi-natural woodland at Wytham Woods in central southern England. We also aimed to quantify the contribution of soil organic matter decomposition (SOM), root-and-rhizosphere respiration, and mycorrhizal respiration components to total soil CO2 efflux, and determine their environmental correlates. Total soil CO2 efflux was measured regularly from April 2006 to December 2008 and found to average 4.1 MgCha-1yr-1 in both 2007 and 2008. In addition, we applied a recently developed approach to partition the efflux into SOM, root-and-rhizosphere, and mycorrhizal components in situ using mesh bags. SOM decomposition, root-and-rhizosphere, and mycorrhizal respiration were estimated to contribute 70±6%, 22±6% and 8±3% of total soil CO2 efflux respectively, equating to 3.0±0.3, 0.9±0.2 and 0.3±0.1 MgCha-1yr-1. In order to avoid the effect of temporal correlation between variables caused by seasonality, we investigated interannual variability by examining the relationship between CO2 flux anomalies and anomalies in environmental variables. Variation in soil temperature explained 50% of the interannual variance in soil CO2 efflux, and soil moisture a further 18% of the residual variance. Solar radiation, as a proxy for plant photosynthesis, had no significant effect on total soil CO2 efflux, but was positively correlated with root-and-rhizosphere respiration, and mycorrhizal respiration. The relationship between anomalies in soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature was highly significant, with a sensitivity of 0.164±0.023$\mu$molCO2m-2s-1°C-1. For mean peak summer efflux rates (2.03$\mu$molCO2m2s-1), this is equivalent to 8% per °C, or a Q10 temperature sensitivity of 2.2±0.2. We demonstrate the utility of an anomaly analysis approach and conclude that soil temperature is the key driver of total soil CO2 efflux primarily through its positive relationship with SOM-decomposition rate. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, little is known of their responses to the seasonal changes in resource availability in deciduous forests, including photosynthate allocation below ground and seasonal inputs of fresh litter. Vertical stratification of and seasonal changes in fungal abundance, activity and community composition were investigated in the litter, organic and upper mineral soils of a temperate Quercus petraea forest using ergosterol and extracellular enzyme assays and amplicon 454-pyrosequencing of the rDNA-ITS region. Fungal activity, biomass and diversity decreased substantially with soil depth. The highest enzyme activities were detected in winter, especially in litter, where these activities were followed by a peak in fungal biomass during spring. The litter community exhibited more profound seasonal changes than did the community in the deeper horizons. In the litter, saprotrophic genera reached their seasonal maxima in autumn, but summer typically saw the highest abundance of ectomycorrhizal taxa. Although the composition of the litter community changes over the course of the year, the mineral soil shows changes in biomass. The fungal community is affected by season. Litter decomposition and phytosynthate allocation represent important factors contributing to the observed variations. {\textcopyright} 2013 New Phytologist Trust.},

AMF colonization and phosphatase activities were both involved in improvements in P cycling and P nutrition in soil. In addition, P cycling was favored in the intercropped plantation, which showed negative correlation with litter C/N and C/P ratios and positive correlation with soil acid phosphatase activity and soil N and P concentrations.

However, little is known about how this plasticity associated with root branching orders respond to atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in subtropical coniferous forests. Methods: We used soil block sampling method to examine the responses of six key root functional parameters (including three morphological traits (specific root length (SRL), root tissue density (RTD), and root diameter), two growth indices (total root length (TRL) and biomass) on an areal basis across five root orders, and ectomycorrhizal (EM) tip colonization) to different doses and species of N addition in a slash pine (Pinus elliottii) plantation in subtropical China. Results: TRL, root biomass in all root orders, and EM tip colonization increased significantly with N addition. However, SRL, RTD, and root diameter did not change in any root orders. In comparison to low doses of N input, high doses of N input exerted greater effects on lower-order roots. In regard to species of N added, stronger responses in lower-order roots were observed under ammonium-based than nitrated-based N input. Foliar P content was significantly decreased and stoichiometric N:P ratio was markedly increased in response to high dose of ammonium-based N input. Conclusions: Fine root growth and EM tip colonization displayed higher degree of plasticity than morphological traits in response to N addition. The plastic responses were not root-order dependent, but dependent on both N dose and species, especially for ephemeral lower-order roots that are mostly like to be the main nutrient acquisition structures. Our results imply that while N limitation was alleviated by exogenous N input, P limitation may persist or even be exacerbated, thus causing an increase of absorptive root length, biomass, and dependence on ectomycorrhizae for nutrient acquisition in subtropical slash pine plantation forests. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {The effects of fire on artificial secondary forests of Pinus massoniana with an average diameter at breast height (DBH) from 5. 5958 cm to 19. 3900 cm, average height from 4. 11 m to 18. 60 m, and average density from 500 clumps hm-2 to 2400 clumps hm-2, were investigated by comparison of burnt and non-burnt plots in a karst mountain area covered by Quaternary clay in central Guizhou province, China. The percentage damage to P. massoniana trees differed among plant organs and followed the order bark (95. 51%) > branches (71. 49%) > crown (62. 95%). The percentage plant death in different forest layers was highest in the herbaceous layer (100%), intermediate in the arbuscular layer (30.43%) and lowest in the arboreous layer (29. 09%). With increasing DBH of P. massoniana in the arboreous layer, the percentage damage to bark was unchanged, whereas damage to branches and the crown decreased, and the percentage death of plants also decreased. At P. massoniana DBH<5 cm, the percentage damage to bark, branches and the crown, percentage plant death and direct loss of biomass were all 100%, whereas at DBH≥25 cm the percentage damage to bark, branches and the crown were 85. 00%, 25. 00% and 15. 00%, respectively, and percentage plant death and direct loss of biomass were zero. In the arbuscular layer, either all individuals of a plant species died, such as P. massoniana, Betula alnoides and Camellia oleifera, all plants survived, such as Prunus serrulata, Myrsine africana and Rhamnus leptophylla, or only some plants died, such as Cunninghamia lanceolata, Castanea seguinii and Aralia chinensis. Plant species in theherbaceous layer either died or germinated after death of aboveground branches and leaves because of fire. In burnt forest, the potential biomass loss (68. 7755 t/ hm2) was higher than direct biomass loss (12. 1818 t/ hm2; percentage direct loss 22.41%). Direct biomass loss differed among the layers and followed the order arboreous layer (6. 9382 t/ hm2) > litter layer (3.3441 t/ hm2) > arbuscular layer (2. 4964 t/ hm2) > herbaceous layer (0. 8861 t/ hm2); in terms of the corresponding percentage direct biomass loss, the order was herbaceous layer (or litter layer, 100. 00%) > arbuscular layer (33. 36%) > arboreous layer (23. 59%). Decreases in the Patrick, Gleason, Simpson and Hurlbert indices followed the order herbaceous layer > arbuscular layer > arboreous layer, and reflected potential losses were higher than direct losses of plant diversity in the different layers of burnt forests. The range and average values of direct diversity loss in the arboreous layer indicated by the Patrick, Gleason, Simpson and Hurlbert indices were 0-1 and 0. 1429, 0-0. 1669 and 0. 0238, 0-1.0000 and 0. 1586, and -0. 1098-0 and -0. 0166, respectively; the corresponding range and average values of percentage direct biodiversity loss were 0-100 and 14. 29, 0-100 and 14. 29, 0. 66-100 and 17. 85, and -18. 61--3. 98 and -11. 29, respectively. The range and average values of direct loss of diversity in the arbuscular layer as measured by these indices were 0-5 and 1. 8571, 0-0. 6948 and 0. 4301, 0-0. 2987 and 0. 1115, and -0. 3477-0 and -0. 1241, respectively; the corresponding range and average values of percentage direct biodiversity loss were 0-42. 86 and 26. 76, 0-42. 85 and 26. 76, 0-86. 35 and 37. 63, and -52. 00-0 and -18. 53, respectively. The range and average values of direct diversity loss in the herbaceous layer indicated by these indices were 2-6 and 3. 8000, 1. 8205-5. 4614 and 3.4589, 0. 2593-0. 8313 and 0. 5300, and 0. 1728-0. 7619 and -0. 4863; the percentage direct loss was 100. 00% for all of the indices. The average burn height of the arboreous layer was negatively correlated to DBH, positively correlated to density and percentage damage to branches, the crown and entire plants, and uncorrelated with percentage damage to bark. The arboreous layer showed higher burn heights than those of the arbuscular layer, and their correlation was negative, and was negatively correlated to potential or direct loss of biomass and positively correlated to percentage direct loss of biomass. Burn height was positively correlated to direct loss or percentage direct loss of biomass, and negatively correlated to potential loss of biomass in the arbuscular layer. Direct loss or percentage direct loss of biomass with the Patrick and Gleason indices was not obviously correlated to burn height in the arboreous layer and was positively correlated to burn height in the arbuscular layer. Burn height was positively correlated to direct loss, and negatively correlated to percentage direct loss, of biomass with the Simpson index in the arboreous layer, and positively correlated to direct loss and percentage direct loss of biomass with the Simpson index in the arbuscular layer. No obvious correlation between burn height of the arboreous or arbuscular layer and direct loss or percentage direct loss of biomass with the Hurlbert index was detected.},

abstract = {It is increasingly recognized that microbiota affect host health and physiology. However, it is unclear what factors shape microbiome community assembly in nature, and how microbiome assembly can be manipulated to improve host health. All plant leaves host foliar endophytic fungi, which make up a diverse, environmentally acquired fungal microbiota. Here, we experimentally manipulated assembly of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao) fungal microbiome in nature and tested the effect of assembly outcome on host health. Using next-generation sequencing, as well as culture-based methods coupled with Sanger sequencing, we found that manipulating leaf litter exposure and location within the forest canopy significantly altered microbiome composition in cacao. Exposing cacao seedlings to leaf litter from healthy conspecific adults enriched the seedling microbiome with Colletotrichum tropicale, a fungal endophyte known to enhance pathogen resistance of cacao seedlings by upregulating host defensive pathways. As a result, seedlings exposed to healthy conspecific litter experienced reduced pathogen damage. Our results link processes that affect the assembly and composition of microbiome communities to their functional consequences for host success, and have broad implications for understanding plant–microbe interactions. Deliberate manipulation of the plant–fungal microbiome also has potentially important applications for cacao production and other agricultural systems in general. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

soil invertebrates influence decomposer community composition and
function. Cord-forming basidiomycete fungi are primary agents of woody
litter decomposition in temperate forests. In laboratory experiments,
grazing by woodlice (Isopoda) is an important factor limiting the
biomass and functioning (decomposition and extracellular enzyme
production) of cord-forming fungi, but its significance in the field has
hitherto not been studied. Field populations of the woodlouse, Oniscus
asellus, were manipulated ('reduced' {[}zero] or standardised at
`current' {[}28 m(-2)] or `double' {[}56 m(-2)] density) in delimited
plots inoculated with different fungi (un-inoculated, Hypholoma
fasciculare or Phanerochaete velutina) and the effects on the microbial
decomposer community assessed after 6 and 12 months. Oniscus asellus
population density was reduced after 12 months in comparison to the
standardised numbers at start. Significant differences between
population densities remained, but varied between fungal inoculation
treatments. Fatty acid analysis revealed O. asellus as a true
generalist; markers for plants, fungi and bacteria were consistently
abundant in storage lipids. Seasonal effects on microbial biomass and
function were strong. Although woodlouse population density neither
affected fungal biomass nor microbial community composition (ergosterol
and soil phospholipid fatty acids), it influenced enzyme activities,
depending on the inoculated fungus. Woodlice significantly reduced
leucine aminopeptidase and lignin-degrading peroxidase activities, only
in un-inoculated plots. In contrast, the highest woodlouse population
density increased beech (Fagus sylvatica) wood decomposition and leucine
aminopeptidase activity in P. velutina-inoculated plots. Increased
enzyme activity and decomposition is likely a stress response,
reflecting increased production of specific enzymes to provide the
energy for mycelial repair and growth responses to grazing. Effects of
grazing on fungal biomass and activity will be strongest at microsites
of woodlouse aggregation and where forest floor woodlouse population
densities are high. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The functional groups of plants that characterize different phases of succession are expected to show differences in root distribution, fine-root traits and degrees of association with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The relationship involving fine-root traits and AM fungi that regulate the nutrient acquisition potential among different plant functional groups are still not well understood. We assessed fine-root morphology, AM fungal variables and soil fertility in grassland, secondary forest and mature forest in Atlantic, Araucaria and Pantanal ecosystems in Brazil. Soil cores were collected at 0-10 and 10-20cm depths. Fine roots were extracted from soil by sieving and root morphological traits and AM colonization were determined. The AM spores were extracted from soil and counted. In all ecosystems, soil fertility, fine-root mass and root diameter increased with the succession, while root length, specific root length, root-hair length, root-hair incidence, AM colonization and AM spore density decreased. These results suggest that plant species from early stages of tropical succession with inherent rapid growth invest in fine roots and maintain a high degree of AM colonization in order to increase the capacity for nutrient acquisition. Conversely, fine root morphological characteristics and low degree of AM colonization exhibited by plants of the later stages of succession lead toward a low nutrient uptake capacity that combine with their typical low growth rates. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).

While melanin and nitrogen content have been identified as factors that influence the decomposition rate of fungal necromass, the effects of mycelial morphology on necromass decomposition remain largely unknown. Using the fungus Armillaria mellea, which produces both diffuse and rhizomorphic biomass in pure culture, we assessed the effects of necromass morphology on decomposition in a 12 week field experiment in Pinus and Quercus dominated forests in Minnesota, USA. Diffuse and rhizomorphic necromass was incubated for 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks to assess differences in decay rates and changes in residual necromass chemistry. Rhizomorphic necromass decomposed significantly slower than diffuse necromass in both forest types. This difference was correlated with initial necromass chemistry, particularly nitrogen content, but not with hydrophobicity. Over the course of the incubation, there was a greater change in the chemistry of diffuse versus rhizomorphic necromass, with both becoming more enriched in recalcitrant compounds. Given that many fungi with both saprotrophic and mycorrhizal ecologies produce rhizomorphs, these results suggest that mycelial morphology should be explicitly considered as an important functional trait influencing the rate of fungal necromass decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Forest thinning is likely to change the soil properties and feedbacks on the structure and function of microbial communities, consequently affecting microbial regulation on the soil carbon process. However, few studies have focused on the mechanism of how thinning affects the quantity and stability of soil carbon. To reveal the influence of thinning on soil carbon and to explore the regulated key factors, this study was conducted in a pure Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr plantation with different thinning intensity (light, medium, and high) in Shanxi province, China. Soil properties (soil pH, soil water content, soil organic carbon, and soil microbial biomass carbon) were measured. Meanwhile, soil microbial communities were examined with the method of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), and soil enzyme activities were measured as indicators of soil microbial functions. The results showed that medium and high thinning has positive effects on soil organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, soil microbial abundance, and soil enzyme activities. Actinomycetes and gram-negative bacteria were the major factors to affect soil microbial community function relating to carbon decomposition. Soil pH contributed to actinomycetes and gram-negative bacteria through direct influences on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Moreover, there were strong correlations between soil pH and microbial community to control soil carbon turnover. The increasing of soil microbial abundance and the microbial regulation on soil carbon in forest thinning need to be considered for sustainable forest management practices in northern China. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

Our interpretations and conclusions are too often based on extrapolations from laboratory microcosm experiments or on anecdotal field evidence. Here, we used natural variations in stable carbon isotope ratios ($\delta$13C) as an approach to distinguish between fungal decomposers and symbiotic mycorrhizal fungal species in the rich sporocarp flora (our sample contains 135 species) of temperate forests. We also demonstrated that host-specific mycorrhizal fungi that receive C from overstorey or understorey tree species differ in their $\delta$13C. The many promiscuous mycorrhizal fungi, associated with and connecting several tree hosts, were calculated to receive 57-100% of their C from overstorey trees. Thus, overstorey trees also support, partly or wholly, the nutrient-absorbing mycelia of their alleged competitors, the understorey trees.},

Burnt soils were collected from three logging coupes burnt 2, 14 and 25 months previously and unburnt soil from adjacent regrowth forests. Compared to unburnt soil, the early seedling growth was stimulated in black burnt soil from all coupes (burnt 2, 14 and 25 months previously). Seedling growth was generally poor in red burnt soil, especially in soil collected 2 months after burning. However, the concentration of extractable P was extremely high in red burnt soil, especially in soil collected 2 months after burning. In black burnt soil, extractable P was increased in soil 2 months after burning, but not in the soils collected 14 or 25 months after burning. However, both total P content and concentration in seedlings were increased in all collections of black burnt soil. Frequency of ectomycorrhizae was high in seedlings grown in all black burnt soils, but the mycorrhizal mantles were poorly developed in seedlings in black burnt soil collected 2 months after burning. Seedlings were also ectomycorrhizal in red burnt soil, except in soil collected 2 months after burning. Fine root inocula from seedlings grown in black burnt soils collected 14 and 25 months after burning significantly stimulated both seedling growth and P uptake compared with the uninoculated control, whereas the fine root inocula from the seedlings grown in all the other soils did not. These results suggest that, in black burnt soil, both direct nutritional changes and changes in the ectomycorrhizae may contribute to seedling growth promotion after regeneration burns. The generally poor seedling growth in red burnt soils is likely to have been due to N deficiency as the seedlings in these soils were yellow-green and the tissue concentrations of N were significantly lower than in other treatments.},

abstract = {Despite the central role of saprotrophic fungi in wood decomposition and terrestrial carbon cycling, the diversity and functioning of wood endophytes (i.e. fungi that asymptomatically colonize living plant tissue) on decay remains poorly understood. In a 4-year field experiment in a boreal forest in the upper midwestern United States, we investigated whether endophytes influenced fungal community structure and subsequent wood decomposition via priority effects. We compared decay of sterilized and non-sterilized birch (Betula papyrifera) logs using both high-throughput sequencing and wood physiochemical analyses (i.e. density loss, dilute alkali solubility, ratio of lignin loss relative to density loss). Endophyte presence significantly altered initial fungal species composition during the first 2 years and enhanced mass loss over the experiment's duration. Results suggest that following tree death the immediate utilization of organic substrates by wood endophytes significantly alters establishment patterns of later arriving fungal saprotrophs. Independent of endophyte presence, white rot was the wood decay outcome at all sampling times, despite an initial presence of both brown and white rot fungi. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that wood endophytes can affect early community assembly and subsequent decay rates, although environmental filtering leads to consistent selection for fungi with lignin-targeted decay strategies.

abstract = {The present-day Rhine alluvial hardwood forest (Querco-Ulmetum minoris, Issler 24) in the upper Rhine valley (France/Germany) is comprised of three vegetation units, one still flooded by calm waters (F) and the two others unflooded, one for 30 years (UF30) (after the river canalisation) and the other for about 130 years (UF130) (after river straightening and embankment work in the middle nineteenth century). In the three stands, species composition, structure and diversity of vegetation and nutrient content of mature leaf, leaf litter and soil have been studied. Fungi (Macromycetae) were only studied in two stands (F and UF130). The intensity of nutrient recycling was exemplified by comparing the chemical composition of rainwater, flood, throughfall, mature leaf, leaf litter, soil and groundwater in two of these stands (F and UF30). The elimination of floods has caused a change in floristic composition, tree density and plant diversity. Tree density was higher in the two unflooded stands and was related to a large increase in sapling (< 6 cm dbh) density more than to a change of stem (> 6 cm dbh) density. Sapling density increased 2 times and three times in the UF30 and the UF130 respectively, whereas the stem density increased only 12% in the first stand and decreased 29% in the second one. The saprophytic macromycete communities have been supplemented with mycorrhizal species. Leaf litter production was slightly greater in the flooded (4.44 T ha-1 yr-1) than in the two unflooded stands (≤ 3.72 T ha-1 yr-1). Foliar N level is twice as high in the flooded stands in spite of an opposite soil status. P level decreased in soil and leaves with the duration of isolation and was at the same level in the groundwater in two stands (F and UF30). K, Mg and Ca contents of green leaf and leaf litter were high due to the geochemistry of the Rhine substrate (calcareous gravels and pebbles) and similar in all the stands studied, even though there are large inputs of these three elements by floods. Moreover we showed that the groundwater chemistry reflected the variations of nutrient inputs and thus could be a good indicator of the functioning of an alluvial ecosystem and of its change as a result of human activities. The restoration of floods in hardwood forest contributes to the preservation of alluvial vegetational structure and composition, the stimulation of biological processes and a better plant mineral nutrition and water supply.},

abstract = {We assessed the degree to which ectomycorrhizal fungi exploit organic nitrogen in situ. In an Alaskan boreal forest, we identified pairs of sporocarps from five taxa of ectomycorrhizal fungi. We added 13C-labeled alanine to the soil surrounding one sporocarp within each pair; the second served as an unlabeled control. Peak rates of 13C-respiration from alanine were higher in the labeled sporocarp plots than the controls, indicating that the 13C-alanine was detectably respired from the soil. "Reference" plots adjacent to the sporocarps served as an indication of background 13C-respiration rates released by the soil community as a whole. Ectomycorrhizal sporocarps displayed higher 13C-respiration rates than their reference plots. Thus, the sporocarps and associated mycorrhizal mycelium appeared to contribute significantly to the release of alanine-derived 13CO2, confirming the hypothesis that ectomycorrhizal fungi may access soil amino acid pools under natural conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Plant communities on nutrient-poor soils are thought to use nutrients more efficiently to produce biomass than plant communities on nutrient-rich soils. Yet, increased efficiency with declining soil nutrients has not been demonstrated empirically in lowland tropical rain forests, where plant growth is thought to be strongly limited by soil nutrients, especially phosphorus (P). We tested for higher P uptake and use efficiency across a 16-fold soil P gradient in lowland Borneo by measuring the P content of aboveground net primary productivity (fine litter production plus new tree growth; ANPP) for 24 months. Extractable soil P was positively related to litter production, tree growth, and ANPP. Efficiency of P response (ANPP/available soil P), uptake (P uptake/available soil P), and use (ANPP/P uptake) increased monotonically with declining soil P and was significantly higher on P-rich soil than P-poor soil. Increased P uptake and use efficiency with declining soil P enabled higher than expected plant productivity on low P soils and thus strongly influenced spatial patterns of aboveground productivity throughout this lowland landscape. A complementary P use efficiency index, the integrated canopy P (Pc) use efficiency of production (ANPP/Pc x residence time of P c), was similar across the P gradient, but underlying dynamics varied significantly with soil P: on rich soils, ANPP/Pc was high and Pc residence time was low, while the converse held on poor soils. These contrasting strategies enabled rapid tree growth on nutrient-rich soils, where P limitation is relatively weak, and higher P conservation on nutrient-poor soils, where P limitation is relatively strong. The occurrence of contrasting P use strategies on high and low P soils has important implications for understanding spatial patterns of aboveground productivity, P cycling, and canopy tree species composition across the P gradient. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Photosynthesis by leaves and acquisition of water and minerals by roots are required for plant growth, which is a key component of many ecosystem functions. Although the role of leaf functional traits in photosynthesis is generally well understood, the relationship of root functional traits to nutrient uptake is not. In particular, predictions of nutrient acquisition strategies from specific root traits are often vague. Roots of nearly all plants cooperate with mycorrhizal fungi in nutrient acquisition. Most tree species form symbioses with either arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. Nutrients are distributed heterogeneously in the soil, and nutrient-rich "hotspots" can be a key source for plants. Thus, predicting the foraging strategies that enable mycorrhizal root systems to exploit these hotspots can be critical to the understanding of plant nutrition and ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. Here, we show that in 13 sympatric temperate tree species, when nutrient availability is patchy, thinner root species alter their foraging to exploit patches, whereas thicker root species do not. Moreover, there appear to be two distinct pathways by which thinner root tree species enhance foraging in nutrient-rich patches: AM trees produce more roots, whereas EM trees produce more mycorrhizal fungal hyphae. Our results indicate that strategies of nutrient foraging are complementary among tree species with contrasting mycorrhiza types and root morphologies, and that predictable relationships between below-ground traits and nutrient acquisition emerge only when both roots and mycorrhizal fungi are considered together.},

abstract = {Characterizing the chemical changes in fungal necromass as it degrades, particularly over short time intervals (days to weeks), is critical to clearly understanding how this organic matter source contributes to various belowground carbon and nutrient pools. Using a range of chemical analyses, we assessed the degradation of four types of ectomycorrhizal fungal necromass from three species differing in biochemical composition. Samples were buried in a forest in Minnesota, USA and harvested at eight time points over a 90-day incubation period (1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 60, 90 days). Three of the necromass types lost greater than 50% of their initial mass in the first seven days, but mass loss plateaued for all four types at later harvests, and after 90 days, none of the samples were completely degraded. Relative to undegraded necromass, degraded necromass consistently contained a lower relative abundance of aliphatic compounds and a higher relative abundance of carbohydrates, sterols, and aromatic compounds. For three of the four necromass types, nitrogen content was lower after 90 days of degradation and FTIR spectra revealed distinct peaks broadening from day 0 to day 90. While melanin content significantly slowed degradation within species, differences in degradation rates across species were more closely aligned with initial nitrogen content. Collectively, our results indicate that the rapid mass loss of dead fungal mycelium is accompanied by a wide range of changes in necromass chemistry, likely contributing to both short-term soil nutrient and longer-term carbon pools. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society},

abstract = {Seedlings near a conspecific adult might suffer increased mortality due to pressure from enemies such as below-ground pathogenic fungi (Janzen–Connell hypothesis), however, variation exists among taxa such that some experience low levels of mortality. We hypothesized that seedlings close to adults might profit, rather than suffer, from below-ground fungi, notably from mycorrhiza or decomposers, in particular near large adult trees and under a closely related canopy. We planted oak seedlings in a temperate forest at different distances from adults and followed seedling mortality, budburst (early budburst permitting photosynthesis during the best light conditions) and leaf herbivory. We applied fungicide on half of the seedlings for 2 years to identify the net effect of below-ground fungi on seedlings. We quantified seedling mycorrhization and fungal-driven decomposition of a neighbourhood-specific and an unspecific substrate, local oak leaves and cellulose respectively. Finally, we related mycorrhization and decomposition to seedling performance. We found that, in seedlings planted close to conspecific adults, below-ground fungi had a negative net effect on seedlings: elimination of fungi, surprisingly, decreased herbivory. This effect could be due to oak leaf decomposition, which was related to increased seedling herbivory and was higher near a conspecific adult. Under a closely related canopy, however, the net effect of below-ground fungi on nearby seedlings became positive: elimination of fungi delayed budburst. This effect could be due to colonization by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Cortinarius sp., which related to accelerated budburst and was higher near a conspecific under a closely related canopy. Effects of below-ground fungi on nearby seedlings were not dependent on the size of the conspecific and were species but not lineage specific. Overall, our results suggest that a Janzen–Connell-like pattern, that is, increased mortality of seedlings near conspecific adult, can be (1) induced by specialist decomposers increasing the nutritional quality of conspecific seedlings to herbivores, and (2) offset by ectomycorrhizal fungal mutualists under a closely related canopy. Coexistence among closely related adult trees appears to change interactions between adults and nearby conspecific seedlings from conspecific inhibition to conspecific facilitation.

Plant carbon budget is also unbalanced during spring reactivation: carbon demand is high to build new tissues and carbon may be provided by reserves only as new photoassimilates are not yet available. Using a stable isotope approach with 13C-labelled litter, we have estimated that after a six months experiment, less than 1% of carbon is derived from litter during spring reactivation and is channelled from the soil to the thick roots of Quercus petraea via ectomycorrhiza, even when leaves are photosynthetically active. Our results are promising for future detailed quantification of different carbon sources (i.e. reserves, photosynthesis and litter derived) in EMf oak trees. They also support the hypothesis that oak trees of Q. petraea in north-eastern France are partially mixotrophic plants. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We hypothesized that these biogeochemical changes would also affect the soil microbial community and the extracellular enzymes responsible for carbon and nutrient mineralization. Across three sites differing in substrate texture and age (50-300 years old), we measured soil enzyme activities and microbial community parameters in native-dominated and Falcataria-invaded plots. Falcataria invasion increased acid phosphatase (AP) activities to >90 $\mu$mol g-1 soil h-1 compared to 30-60 $\mu$mol g-1 soil h-1 in native-dominated stands. Extracellular enzymes that mineralize carbon and nitrogen also increased significantly under Falcataria on the younger substrates. By contrast, total microbial biomass and mycorrhizal abundance changed little with invasion or substrate. However, fungal:bacterial ratios declined dramatically with invasion, from 2.69 and 1.35 to <0.89 on the 50- and 200-year-old substrates, respectively. These results suggest that Falcataria invasion alters the composition and function of belowground soil communities in addition to forest structure and biogeochemistry. The increased activities of AP and other enzymes that we observed are consistent with a shift toward phosphorus limitation and rapid microbial processing of litterfall C and N following Falcataria invasion.},

abstract = {Many field and laboratory studies have demonstrated that the addition of easily available carbon can increase rates of decomposition of plant litter or humified soil organic matter, though opposite trends are also common. In boreal forests, a large part of labile carbon enters soil via tree roots and ectomycorrhizal (EM) network. The influence of increased C availability and the presence of EM roots on litter decomposition was studied in a long-term field experiment in a 50-year-old Picea abies plantation. Litterbags containing litter of three species (Populus tremula, Quercus robur, or P. abies) were buried to the depth of ca. 2.5 cm. The experiment was set up in a full-factorial design with carbon availability and presence of roots as factors. Carbon was added as an aqueous sucrose solution (50 g C m-2) every second week during snow-free period. Spruce roots around and underneath experimental plots were cut once a month. Subsets of litterbags were analysed after 12, 21 and 24 months. The serial dilution technique was used to assess the fungal community composition. The addition of labile carbon led to a strong decrease in litter decomposition rates, associated with consistent shifts in the composition of saprotrophic microfungal communities, and to an increase in the overall density of culturable fungal species (r-strategists), but not of specialized cellulolytic microfungi (K-strategists), isolated on Hutchinson agar. Sucrose addition did not affect the number of species isolated but the dominance structure was shifted toward the domination of the 2-4 most abundant species. The presence of EM roots significantly reduced moisture content in decomposing litter but had only weak and inconsistent effect on the decomposition rates and on the community composition of saprotrophic microfungi; these effects did not depend on the level of carbon availability. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

An adjacent natural broadleaf forest (BROAD-Nat) was used as a control. We determined microbial biomass C and N contents, enzyme activities, and community composition (via phospholipid fatty acid [PLFA] assessment). Both microbial biomass and PLFA content were higher in the summer than in the winter and differed among the forests in summer only. Total PLFA, total bacterial, gram-positive bacterial, gram-negative bacterial, and vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal contents followed the same pattern. Total fungal content and the ratios of fungi to bacteria and of gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria were highest in CONIF-40, with no difference between the other forests. Principal component analysis of PLFA contents revealed that CONIF-40 communities were distinct from those of CONIF-80 and BROAD-Nat. Our results suggest that vegetation replacement during reforestation exerts a prolonged impact on the soil microbial community. The understory broadleaf shrubs and trees established after coniferous plantation reforestation may balance out the effects of coniferous litter, contributing to bacterial recovery. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the authors.},

abstract = {Invasive trees can alter soil properties and ecosystem functioning by producing phenolic compounds. Phenolics can influence carbon and nitrogen availability as well as enzymatic activity or act as signaling molecules. In plant-microorganism interactions, species-specific phenolics can be the source of food or toxicity. They may have antimicrobial, stimulatory or both (ambiguous) properties and thus affect soil microbial properties, enzymatic activity, and plant-soil feedbacks differently. We hypothesized that phenolic compounds with antimicrobial properties produced by invasive Quercus rubra would reduce soil microbial biomass and enzymatic activity, and alter microbial community structure. We expected these changes to be most pronounced in the soil organic horizon as they are driven by litter chemistry. We tested changes, potentially associated with the concentrations of 12 phenolic compounds in Q. rubra litter and soil, in microbial properties (respiration rate, bacterial and fungal biomass), enzymatic activity, and microbial community structure in organic and mineral soil horizons as well as in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spore number and species richness in mineral soil horizon. We found that Q. rubra reduced several soil parameters, namely respiration rate, phosphatase activity, total microbial biomass, bacterial (both G + and G–) biomass, and 16:1$\omega$5 NLFA AMF storage lipid marker as well as changed microbial community structure, which supports our hypothesis that the phenolics produced by Q. rubra have mostly toxic effect on native soil communities. However, Q. rubra did not affect arylsulfatase and urease activity, saprotrophic fungi population, and the number of AMF spores and species. The changes in soil microbial properties and enzymatic activity may be related to high amounts of ellagic acid, ferulic acid, phloridzin, and syringic acid provided with newly shed Q. rubra litter to the soil surface. Some phenolics found in soil, i.e., phloridzin and (–)-epicatechin, correlated negatively, while others, i.e., quercetin and chlorogenic acid, correlated positively with soil microbial parameters and/or enzymatic activity, which suggest either antimicrobial or stimulatory properties of these compounds. Our study demonstrated that invasive Q. rubra has multiple potential effects on soil microbial communities, which can mediate plant-soil feedbacks. Future research should address the long-term consequences of these changes for forest ecosystems and the fitness of native flora. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Epiphytic orchids, which account for 68% of vascular epiphytes, contribute substantially to plant species diversity in forest canopies. Many orchid species are naturally rare and have limited geographical distributions. All orchids rely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient acquisition during seed germination and seedling establishment, and many species retain these associations throughout their lifecycle. Due to their reliance on mycorrhizal fungi, epiphytic orchid species with highly specific mycorrhizal associations may be geographically restricted and are often rare. Dendrobium okinawense is a rare epiphytic orchid endemic to the Yambaru Forest in Japan and to southern Taiwan. We hypothesized that this species exhibits high mycorrhizal specificity and tested this hypothesis via identification of the species' mycorrhizal associates. We collected root samples of this orchid from four tree species and assessed mycorrhizal fungi in 25 root fragments harvested from 10 plants. Fungi were identified using molecular methods based on fungal isolates and DNA extracted from mycorrhizal roots. Detected fungi were assigned to 21 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% sequence similarity of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region sequences. TU11, an OTU belonging to Tulasnellaceae (Basidiomycota), was the most frequently detected OTU, occurring in 20 root fragments from all 10 sampled individuals. Our results indicate that Dendrobium okinawense has a highly specific association with TU11. Further, this specificity may be high relative to the Dendrobium species assessed in other studies. These findings support the hypothesis that Dendrobium okinawense exhibits high mycorrhizal specificity. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Japanese Forest Society.},

abstract = {The impact of atmospheric nitrogen deposition on forest ecosystems depends in large part on its fate. Past tracer studies show that litter and soils dominate the short-term fate of added 15N, yet few have examined its longer term dynamics or differences among forest types. This study examined the fate of a 15N-NO- 3 tracer over 5–6 years in a mixed deciduous stand that was evenly composed of trees with ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. The tracer was expected to slowly mineralize from its main initial fate in litter and surface soil, with some 15N moving to trees, some to deeper soil, and some net losses. Recovery of added 15N in trees and litterfall totaled 11.3% both 1 and 5–6 years after the tracer addition, as 15N redistributed from fine and especially coarse roots into cumulative litterfall and small accumulations in woody tissues. Estimates of potential carbon sequestration from tree 15N recovery amounted to 12–14 kg C per kg of N deposition. Tree 15N acquisition occurred within the first year after the tracer addition, with no subsequent additional net transfer of 15N from detrital to plant pools. In both years, ectomycorrhizal trees gained 50% more of the tracer than did trees with arbuscular mycorrhizae. Much of the 15N recovered in wood occurred in tree rings formed prior to the 15N addition, demonstrating the mobility of N in wood. Tracer recovery rapidly decreased over time in surface litter material and accumulated in both shallow and deep soil, perhaps through mixing by earthworms. Overall, results showed redistribution of tracer 15N through trees and surface soils without any losses, as whole-ecosystem recovery remained constant between 1 and 5–6 years at 70% of the 15N addition. These results demonstrate the persistent ecosystem retention of N deposition even as it redistributes, without additional plant uptake over this timescale. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Soils of northern temperate and boreal forests represent a large terrestrial carbon (C) sink. The fate of this C under elevated atmospheric CO2 and climate change is still uncertain. A fundamental knowledge gap is the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) and saprotrophic fungi contribute to C cycling in the systems by soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition. In this study, we used a novel approach to generate and compare enzymatically active EMF hyphae-dominated and saprotrophic hyphae-enriched communities under field conditions. Fermentation-humus (FH)-filled mesh bags, surrounded by a sand barrier, effectively trapped EMF hyphae with a community structure comparable to that found in the surrounding FH layer, at both trophic and taxonomic levels. In contrast, over half the sequences from mesh bags with no sand barrier were identified as belonging to saprotrophic fungi. The EMF hyphae-dominated systems exhibited levels of hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme activities that were comparable to or higher than saprotroph-enriched systems. The enzymes assayed included those associated with both labile and recalcitrant SOM degradation. Our study shows that EMF hyphae are likely important contributors to current SOM turnover in sub-boreal systems. Our results also suggest that any increased EMF biomass that might result from higher below-ground C allocation by trees would not suppress C fluxes from sub-boreal soils. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Microbial Ecology.

abstract = {We investigated how forest composition, litter quality, and rainfall interact to affect leaf litter decomposition across three successional tropical dry forests in Costa Rica. We monitored litter stocks and bulk litter turnover in 18 plots that exhibit substantial variation in soil characteristics, tree community structure, fungal communities (including forests dominated by ecto- or arbuscular mycorrhizal host trees), and forest age. Simultaneously, we decomposed three standard litter substrates over a 6-month period spanning an unusually intense drought. Decay rates of standard substrates depended on the interaction between litter identity and forest type. Decomposition rates were correlated with tree and soil fungal community composition as well as soil fertility, but these relationships differed among litter types. In low fertility soils dominated by ectomycorrhizal oak trees, bulk litter turnover rates were low, regardless of soil moisture. By contrast, in higher fertility soils that supported mostly arbuscular mycorrhizal trees, bulk litter decay rates were strongly dependent on seasonal water availability. Both measures of decomposition increased with forest age, as did the frequency of termite-mediated wood decay. Taken together, our results demonstrate that soils and forest age exert strong control over decomposition dynamics in these tropical dry forests, either directly through effects on microclimate and nutrients, or indirectly by affecting tree and microbial community composition and traits, such as litter quality. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The taxation description of cedar plantations showed that both urban and Siberian cedar plantings in the urban environment and beyond are distinguished by good growth. In the studied objects, the presence of phytopathogenic fungi dangerous for trees was found in soils, such as Aphanomyces, Fusarium, Phytophthora, Pythium, Verticillium, and the presence of saprotrophic fungi with antagonistic properties, such as Mucorales, Clonostachys, Trichoderma, Mortierella, Mucor. Phytopathogenic activity correlates inversely with the activity of saprotrophs-antagonists found in the zone of coexistence. According to microbiological indicators, the diversity of antagonistic fungi with signs of high suppression indicates the well-being of the studied soil samples. Based on the sanitary-microbiological assessment in the studied cedar groves, recommendations were developed and proposed for protecting soils in the cedar stands, such as selective forest protection measures, clearing of litter, and laboratory tests to determine the toxicity of soils that affect the growth and development of cedar stands. {\textcopyright} 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Two aspartic proteases were excreted in a pH-dependent manner by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria grown in liquid culture. AmProt1 with a molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa was mainly present at pH values up to 5.4, whereas the excretion of AmProt2 with a molecular mass of about 90 kDa was only detectable at pH values between pH 5.4 and 6.3. In addition, the pH optima of both enzymes differed significantly. AmProt1 had a narrow pH optimum around 3, whereas AmProt2 had a broad pH optimum between 3 and 5.5 and a higher affinity to the substrate methylcasein. One cDNA-clone (AmProt1*) that presumably encodes AmProt1 was identified. Like AmProt1, this cDNA was expressed in a pH-dependent manner. In addition, carbohydrate and to a lesser extent nitrogen depletion significantly enhanced AmProt1* expression. In fully developed Populus hyb./A. muscaria ectomycorrhizas the expression of AmProt1* was significantly higher in hyphae of the Hartig net compared with those of the fungal sheath. The role of AmProt1 and AmProt2 for fungal physiology and competitiveness is discussed.},

As the methods of sampling and the isolation procedure were maintained constant, the results could be compared across hosts and fungal assemblages. The diversity of endophytes was less in both forests, owing to host recurrence. The litter fungi showed a higher diversity in both forests when compared with endophytes or phellophytes. There was little overlap between the species assemblages of the 3 ecological groups of fungi. Hence, to be cost effective, diversity estimation exercises for fungi in the tropics should include different fungal substrates rather than one substrate (or ecological group); it appears that even small sample sizes of different substrates would provide an approximation that is the near-real species diversity, rather than using large sample sizes of any one particular indicator group of fungi.},

Chronic nitrogen (N) amendments frequently cause the accumulation of soil organic matter within soils, suggesting that elevated N disrupts decomposition by altering fungal communities. To link previously observed increases in soil organic matter with potential changes in the fungal community, we assessed the effects of soil N amendment on fungal community structure at a long-term N addition experiment at Harvard Forest (Petersham, MA, USA). A decline in the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi following long-term N addition was offset by an increase in the relative abundance of saprotrophs. Species richness and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi declined, while ascomycetes and saprotrophs responded positively to N enrichment. However, nitrophilic species included ectomycorrhizal as well as saprotrophic fungi, especially the ectomycorrhizal Russula vinacea, whose relative abundance increased from 10 to 37% of the entire community across N treatments. Two decades of soil N enrichment appears to have fundamentally altered the soil fungal community of this temperate forest. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.},

The chapter gives a brief introduction to litter decomposition mechanisms in saprotrophic fungi. To investigate experimentally the capacity of ECM fungi to decompose humic-rich SOM and the mechanisms underlying this decomposition, a series of experiments have been conducted using Paxillus involutus as a "model" species. ECM fungi have evolved from diverse nutritional backgrounds, including litter decomposers and WR and BR wood decayers. During these transitions, ECM lineages lost many genes related to saprotrophy. There is evidence that some ECM employ the Fenton reaction during SOM decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Samples were obtained from the diverse substrates : from naked soil, from the forest floor on needle litter, from between peat moss, from rotten bark of standing trees, and from stumps and rotten wood. Associations with ascomycetes were found in most of the specimens independent from the substrate. Seven species sampled from soil were found to contain basidiomycete hyphae. Ultrastructure consistently showed dolipores with imperforate parenthesomes. Molecular phylogenetic studies revealed that three specimens belonging to the Jungermanniales were associated with members of Sebacinaceae, while Aneura pinguis (Metzgeriales) was associated with a Tulasnella species. These taxa are so far the only basidiomycetes known to be symbiotically associated with leafy liverworts. The probability that the associations with Sebacinaceae are evolutionary old, but the Tulasnella associations more derived is discussed. The sebacinoid mycobionts form a similar interaction type with the jungermannialian leafy liverworts as do the associated ascomycetes. The term 'jungermannioid mycorrhiza' is proposed for this distinctive symbiotic interaction type.},

abstract = {Plant nutrients can be recycled through microbial decomposition of organic matter but replacement of base cations and phosphorus, lost through harvesting of biomass/biofuels or leaching, requires de novo supply of fresh nutrients released through weathering of soil parent material (minerals and rocks). Weathering involves physical and chemical processes that are modified by biological activity of plants, microorganisms and animals. This article reviews recent progress made in understanding biological processes contributing to weathering. A perspective of increasing spatial scale is adopted, examining the consequences of biological activity for weathering from nanoscale interactions, through in vitro and in planta microcosm and mesocosm studies, to field experiments, and finally ecosystem and global level effects. The topics discussed include the physical alteration of minerals and mineral surfaces; the composition, amounts, chemical properties, and effects of plant and microbial secretions; and the role of carbon flow (including stabilisation and sequestration of C in organic and inorganic forms). Although the predominant focus is on the effects of fungi in forest ecosystems, the properties of biofilms, including bacterial interactions, are also discussed. The implications of these biological processes for modelling are discussed, and we attempt to identify some key questions and knowledge gaps, as well as experimental approaches and areas of research in which future studies are likely to yield useful results. A particular focus of this article is to improve the representation of the ways in which biological processes complement physical and chemical processes that mobilise mineral elements, making them available for plant uptake. This is necessary to produce better estimates of weathering that are required for sustainable management of forests in a post-fossil-fuel economy. While there are abundant examples of nanometre- and micrometre-scale physical interactions between microorganisms and different minerals, opinion appears to be divided with respect to the quantitative significance of these observations for overall weathering. Numerous in vitro experiments and microcosm studies involving plants and their associated microorganisms suggest that the allocation of plant-derived carbon, mineral dissolution and plant nutrient status are tightly coupled, but there is still disagreement about the extent to which these processes contribute to field-scale observations. Apart from providing dynamically responsive pathways for the allocation of plant-derived carbon to power dissolution of minerals, mycorrhizal mycelia provide conduits for the long-distance<span idCombining double low line"page1508"/> transportation of weathering products back to plants that are also quantitatively significant sinks for released nutrients. These mycelial pathways bridge heterogeneous substrates, reducing the influence of local variation in <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">C:N</span> ratios. The production of polysaccharide matrices by biofilms of interacting bacteria and/or fungi at interfaces with mineral surfaces and roots influences patterns of production of antibiotics and quorum sensing molecules, with concomitant effects on microbial community structure, and the qualitative and quantitative composition of mineral-solubilising compounds and weathering products. Patterns of carbon allocation and nutrient mobilisation from both organic and inorganic substrates have been studied at larger spatial and temporal scales, including both ecosystem and global levels, and there is a generally wider degree of acceptance of the "systemic" effects of microorganisms on patterns of nutrient mobilisation. Theories about the evolutionary development of weathering processes have been advanced but there is still a lack of information connecting processes at different spatial scales. Detailed studies of the liquid chemistry of local weathering sites at the micrometre scale, together with upscaling to soil-scale dissolution rates, are advocated, as well as new approaches involving stable isotopes. {\textcopyright} 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

abstract = {Plant roots, their associated microbial community and free-living soil microbes interact to regulate the movement of carbon from the soil to the atmosphere, one of the most important and least understood fluxes of terrestrial carbon. Our inadequate understanding of how plant-microbial interactions alter soil carbon decomposition may lead to poor model predictions of terrestrial carbon feedbacks to the atmosphere. Roots, mycorrhizal fungi and free-living soil microbes can alter soil carbon decomposition through exudation of carbon into soil. Exudates of simple carbon compounds can increase microbial activity because microbes are typically carbon limited. When both roots and mycorrhizal fungi are present in the soil, they may additively increase carbon decomposition. However, when mycorrhizas are isolated from roots, they may limit soil carbon decomposition by competing with free-living decomposers for resources. We manipulated the access of roots and mycorrhizal fungi to soil in situ in a temperate mixed deciduous forest. We added 13C-labelled substrate to trace metabolized carbon in respiration and measured carbon-degrading microbial extracellular enzyme activity and soil carbon pools. We used our data in a mechanistic soil carbon decomposition model to simulate and compare the effects of root and mycorrhizal fungal presence on soil carbon dynamics over longer time periods. Contrary to what we predicted, root and mycorrhizal biomass did not interact to additively increase microbial activity and soil carbon degradation. The metabolism of 13C-labelled starch was highest when root biomass was high and mycorrhizal biomass was low. These results suggest that mycorrhizas may negatively interact with the free-living microbial community to influence soil carbon dynamics, a hypothesis supported by our enzyme results. Our steady-state model simulations suggested that root presence increased mineral-associated and particulate organic carbon pools, while mycorrhizal fungal presence had a greater influence on particulate than mineral-associated organic carbon pools. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the activity of enzymes involved in organic matter decomposition was contingent upon root-mycorrhizal-microbial interactions. Using our experimental data in a decomposition simulation model, we show that root-mycorrhizal-microbial interactions may have longer-term legacy effects on soil carbon sequestration. Overall, our study suggests that roots stimulate microbial activity in the short term, but contribute to soil carbon storage over longer periods of time. {\textcopyright} 2015 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Naturally thermotolerant vegetation in New Zealand is concentrated in approximately 39 geothermally heated areas totalling only 580 ha scattered along the 300 km length of the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Relationships between composition and structure of vegetation and environment were analysed at the comparatively large (95 ha) and unmodified Te Kopia geothermal steamfield. Vascular vegetation was mostly influenced by a strong gradient in soil temperature, ranging at 15 cm depth from 15°C to 90°C across the steamfield. Dominant species changed from evergreen, broadleaved forest at the cool end of this gradient to dominance on increasingly hot soils by myrtaceous and epacrid (southern heath) shrubs with small needle‐like leaves and shallow roots. While differences in cryptogam composition were mostly associated with spatial variation in soil temperature, they were also significantly influenced by soil acidity and Al concentration. All soils sampled along the gradient had low fertility, high acidity, and high levels of Al, SO4, and Fe. This suggests that vegetation considered to be geothermally influenced should include relatively tall forest and scrub further from fumarole centres than has previously been recognised. Plants of geothermal areas tolerate acid soils with levels of Al that normally would be toxic. Mycorrhizal relationships may play important roles in plant survivorship in this environment by assisting nutrient acquisition. In common with the changes in community characteristics typical of other steep gradients of increasing stress, as soil temperatures increase so canopy height, plant stature, species richness, leaf size, and rooting depth decrease. These distinctive ecosystems provide excellent opportunities for research on plant community response to natural stress. {\textcopyright} 1997 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Understanding plant roots induced changes in soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition, the rhizosphere effect, is critical to predict soil carbon and nutrient cycling within and across biomes. Root functional traits are proposed to regulate the rhizosphere effect. We measured the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition by incubating rhizosphere and bulk soils sampled from 14 hardwood species with distinct mycorrhizal associations (Arbuscular mycorrhizal, AM vs. Ectomycorrhizal, ECM). We also measured root traits (related to chemistry, morphology and physiology), soil enzymes related to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous cycling and soil physico-chemical properties, which could explain the mechanisms that regulate interspecific variation of the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition. There was large interspecific variation in the rhizosphere effects on SOM decomposition and soil enzymes, which was not influenced by mycorrhizal associations. Root traits were more strongly correlated with the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition across the 14 hardwood species than bulk soil physico-chemical properties. Specifically, the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition was correlated positively with root nitrogen concentration, and negatively with root carbon/nitrogen ratio and root diameter, respectively. These three root traits were the most important predictors for the interspecific variation of the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition amongst all measured variables. Moreover, the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition tended to increase with increasing root exudationn rates. This is compelling evidence that the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition tends to increase along the root economics spectrum from conservative species to acquisitive species in woody plants. Our findings thus contribute to a better mechanistic link between root traits and rhizosphere effect across species, which could be incorporated into land surface models to predict ecosystem scale consequences of root induced changes in SOM decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Predicting the response of fine roots to increased atmospheric CO2 concentration has important implications for carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Root architecture is known to play an important role in how trees acquire soil resources in changing environments. However, the effects of elevated CO2 on the fine-root architecture of trees remain unclear. We investigated the architectural response of fine roots exposed to 14 yr of CO2 enrichment and 6 yr of nitrogen (N) fertilization in a Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) forest. Root traits reflecting geometry, topology and uptake function were measured on intact fine-root branches removed from soil monoliths and the litter layer. CO2 enrichment resulted in the development of a fine-root pool that was less dichotomous and more exploratory under N-limited conditions. The per cent mycorrhizal colonization did not differ among treatments, suggesting that root growth and acclimation to elevated CO2 were quantitatively more important than increased mycorrhizal associations. Our findings emphasize the importance of architectural plasticity in response to environmental change and suggest that changes in root architecture may allow trees to effectively exploit larger volumes of soil, thereby pre-empting progressive nutrient limitations. {\textcopyright} 2014 New Phytologist Trust.},

Focusing on decomposer (Oribatida) and predatory mites (Mesostigmata) we investigated the incorporation of resources from leaf litter rich (European beech, Fagus sylvatica) and poor (European ash, Fraxinus excelsior) in structural compounds using stable isotopes. Using litter mixtures we investigated if soil mites preferentially incorporate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) derived from beech or ash leaf litter. Using the rotated-core method we established treatments with and without mycorrhiza as interactions between mycorrhiza and saprotrophic microorganisms may alter the availability of litter resources to soil invertebrates. Conform to our expectations primary decomposers incorporated more C and N than secondary decomposers or predators, but the contribution to body tissue element concentration was low suggesting that they predominantly rely on other resources than litter from the previous year. Generally, soil mites incorporated more C and N from ash than from beech litter, but this was less pronounced after 10 as compared to after 5 months, presumably due to fast decomposition of ash litter. In contrast to our expectations the use of litter resources by soil mites was little affected by mycorrhiza. Overall, the results underline that, at least during the first year of litter decay, leaf litter resources are of minor importance for soil mite nutrition, and this is particularly true for litter rich in structural compounds such as beech. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {The spatiotemporal dynamics of, and interspecific differences in, the acquisition of litter-derived nitrogen (N) by natural assemblages of ectomycorrhizal root tips are poorly understood. Small cylindrical mesh bags containing 15N-labelled beech (Fagus sylvatica) leaf litter that permit hyphal but not root ingrowth were inserted vertically into the top soil layer of an old-growth beech forest. The lateral transfer of 15N into the circumjacent soil, roots, microbes and ectomycorrhizas was measured during an 18-month exposure period. Ectomycorrhial fungi (EMF) showed large interspecific variation in the temporal pattern and extent of 15N accumulation. Initially, when N was mainly available from the leachate, microbes were more efficient at N immobilization than the majority of EMF, but distinct fungal species also showed significant 15N accumulation. During later phases, the enrichment of 15N in Tomentella badia was higher than in microbes and other EMF species. Roots and soil accumulated 15N with a large delay compared with microbes and EMF. Because approximately half of the studied fungal species had direct access to N from leaf litter and the remainder to N from leached compounds, we suggest that EMF diversity facilitates the N utilization of the host by capturing N originating from early-released solutes and late degradation products from a recalcitrant source. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors New Phytologist {\textcopyright} 2013 New Phytologist Trust.},

Observational and experimental evidence suggests that leaf litter from arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree species has a faster decomposition rate than leaf litter from ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree species. This could be due to the diversity and activity of decomposer microorganisms, but remains to be confirmed in subtropical forests. In this study, we compared the effects of fungi and bacteria on decomposition rates of litter from AM and ECM subtropical trees. In the field, we conducted a fungal hyphal exclusion experiment beneath AM and ECM trees. We also used fungicides and bactericides to distinguish the contribution of bacteria and fungi to litter decomposition in a shade-house experiment. Fungi were responsible more leaf litter decay in soil around AM trees than in soil around ECM trees. When fungi were excluded, AM and ECM litters with similar chemical properties decomposed at the same rate, but the AM litters decayed more quickly when saprotrophic fungi were present. Soil around AM trees had more abundance of saprotrophic fungi and greater N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase activities than soil around ECM trees. We conclude that the higher leaf litter decomposition rates under AM trees were due to the saprotrophic fungi in the soil microbial community. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The presumptive assays indicated that most mycorrhizal fungi have only low abilities to degrade these compounds relative to the wood decomposing fungi. In general, ericoid mycorrhizal fungi were capable of greater phenolic degradation than most ECM species, and degradative ability was associated with production of phenol-oxidizing enzymes. In no case was presumptive degradation of lignin or soluble phenolic, or production of phenol-oxidizing enzymes by mycorrhizal fungi as great as that of the wood decomposing fungi. In the case of the ericoid endophyte Hymenoscyphus ericae, phenol-oxidation was associated with production of an extracellular o-polyphenol oxidase (tyrosinase) which showed optimal activity at a pH of 5-5.5 and temperature of 30 °C.

abstract = {The fate and effects of increased N deposition were investigated by experimental manipulation in a mature Norway spruce plantation at Klosterhede, western Denmark. The ambient N deposition was 15-20 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Addition of 35 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as ammonium nitrate to a 500-m2 plot was carried out by handspraying monthly for 4 years. During the first year the spray was labeled with 15N. Tree growth was depressed by 4 successive spring or summer droughts throughout the treatment years. The nitrogen concentration in needles increased in the third year of treatment and critical low P concentrations (0.6-1 mg Pg-1) developed possibly as a combined effect of drought and N stress on roots and mycorrhizae. Reduced retranslocation of N was indicated by increased concentration and flux of N in needle litterfall. Increased uptake of N was observed in all parts of the trees and the fraction of the input N taken up was increased from 32 to 43%, whereas the fraction immobilized in the soil was decreased from 40 to 33% of the input N. The decomposition remained unchanged, whereas the net N mineralization was increased 85% over the control. The effect on net mineralization may have resulted from saturation of the immobilization process rather than from an increase in gross mineralization. Soil respiration was not affected, indicating that microbial activity did not respond. Nitrification and denitrification were not important in either control or treated soils. Soil solution chemistry responded promptly to nitrogen applications. Nitrate concentrations increased at all depths, and nitrate leaching increased from < 0.3 to 4.2 kg N ha-1 yr-1 by the third year. Reduced biological control on nitrate leaching was indicated by increased nitrate concentration in soil water at the end of the growing season. Ammonium concentrations increased down to 15 cm depth, but all ammonium was retained in the system. Despite the increased nitrate leaching, 92% of the total inputs were retained. No changes in concentrations of other major ions due to the N additions were detectable. The effects of the successive droughts on growth and nutrient cycling caused significant interaction on the response to N addition. Continuation of the N addition treatment will be necessary to observe the full response of the simulated deposition increase in this forest.},

abstract = {More than 400 species of vascular plants, in 87 genera, are acholophyllous and heterotrophic, but not directly parasitic upon autotrophs. They are usually, but incorrectly, described as 'saprophytes'since they are in fact nourished by means of specialized mycorrhizal associations. Although distributed world‐wide, they are most abundant and show the greatest species‐richness in the Neotropics and Palaeotropical regions. Their aerial parts range in size from a few centimetres to extensive liane types up to 40 m long. With few exceptions, their habitats are dense moist forests in which there is a surface accumulation of leaf litter, often in situations which are too shaded for autotrophic growth. Although the achlorophyllous mycorrhizal mode of life has evolved independently many times and in widely disparate taxonomic groups, such plants show strong convergent evolution in particular adaptations to their peculiar mode of life. Most prominant amongst these are reductions in the size of seed and embryo, and the lack of differentiation of the embryo at maturity. The number of seeds produced by each flower is typically very large and the shape, structure and surface features of seeds involving adaptation for wind dispersal show remarkable parallels in many species. Specific adaptations for zoochory are rare but well developed in a small number of genera, some of which produce scents like fungal fruit bodies or floral parts which mimic fungal sporocarps. Vegetative parts are often even more conspicuously reduced. Most myco‐heterotrophs are entirely subterranean for most of their lives and these stages exhibit adaptations consistent with a change in function from organs of absorption to organs of storage, shown by the almost universal loss of root hairs, decrease in surface area as exhibited in short cylindric‘vermiform'and tuberous roots or, in extreme cases, the complete suppression of roots and the formation of a swollen tuber or rhizome. Increased width of the root cortex often accommodates mycorrhizal infection and stores of carbohydrates and other materials obtained from the fungal symbiont. Mycorrhizal infection is confined to the below‐ground parts of the plants but may be found there in modified stems as well as in roots. In many genera, stems are exceptionally slender and thread‐like and their vascular tissues are either reduced to a single narrow cylinder of bicollateral bundles or, minimally, to four or six narrow bundles in the cortex. Secondary thickening is poorly developed in all but a tiny minority of species, lignification being confined to annular or, rarely, a few scalariform xylem vessels. Phloem is present in very small amounts and then mainly as parenchyma with sieve tubes frequently recorded as narrow and possibly with abherent sieve plates. Leaves are typically reduced to widely spaced achlorophyllous scales on the inflorescence axis. Occasionally, they are present only on underground rhizomes or tubers. The vascular supply to the leaf‐scales, normally reduced to a single trace, may be absent. Vestigial stomata are sometimes found on leaves and, in a few species which retain traces of chlorophyll, on shoots but, in most fully heterotrophic species, stomata are absent from aerial parts. Since their seeds are very small and contain minimal reserve carbohydrates, the germination of myco‐heterotrophs in nature would appear to depend upon infection by an appropriate symbiotic fungus at an early stage. The nature of the carbohydrates transferred from the fungus to the plants has not been determined. Once acquired from The fungal partner, most plants store carbon in a variety of forms, the most common of which is starch, although other compounds including glucomannan, fructan and calcium oxalate art important in some specks. Asexual reproduction is frequently important with root tubers, tubercles and rhizomes providing the means of vegetative spread. Nonetheless, all the angiospermous species recorded to date also reproduce sexually. Floral structures show varying degrees of reduction concomitant with myco‐heterotrophy. Inflorescences are typically small, often with a single terminal flower, and the floral parts often show extreme simplification, with the production of unilocular or, more rarely, bilocular and trilocular ovaries. In some of the most highly adapted species, there is reduction of integumentary layers surrounding each ovule from the normal bitegmic condition to unitegmic or, occasionally, ategmic. With the principal exception of the Monotropaceae, placentation is typically trimerous and parietal. Flowers normally appear to be cross‐pollinated and are brightly coloured. nectiferous, occasionally scented, and can demonstrate extreme morphological adaptations which attract insects as in the production of lone caudate tepals or fungus‐mimicking structures. Much is still to be learned about the adaptive features and especially about the physiology of these plants and of their early developmental stages during which the essential associations with fungi are established. Similarly, studies of the taxonomy and physiology of most of their fungal partners are still in their infancy. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract = {Niche differentiation for different soil substrates has been proposed as a mechanism contributing to ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity. This hypothesis has been largely untestable because of a lack of techniques to study the in situ distribution of ectomycorrhizal hyphae. We developed a technique involving soil DNA extraction, PCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis for species identification to investigate the vertical distribution of fungal hyphae in four distinct layers of the forest floor (lower litter, F-layer, H-layer, and B-horizon) of a Pinus resinosa plantation. Fungal communities differed markedly among the four layers. Cluster analysis suggested six different patterns of resource utilization: litter-layer specialists, litterlayer generalists, F-layer, H-layer, and B-horizon species, and multilayer generalists. Known ectomycorrhizal species were found in all six clusters. This spatial partitioning observed among ectomycorrhizal fungi along a single, relatively simple substrate-resource gradient supports the niche differentiation hypothesis as an important mechanism contributing to ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity.},

abstract = {Saprotrophic wood-inhabiting basidiomycetes are the most important decomposers of lignin and cellulose in dead wood and as such they attracted considerable attention. The aims of this work were to quantify the activity and spatial distribution of extracellular enzymes in coarse wood colonised by the white-rot basidiomycete Fomes fomentarius and in adjacent fruitbodies of the fungus and to analyse the diversity of the fungal and bacterial community in a fungus-colonised wood and its potential effect on enzyme production by F. fomentarius. Fungus-colonised wood and fruitbodies were collected in low management intensity forests in the Czech Republic. There were significant differences in enzyme production by F. fomentarius between Betula pendula and Fagus sylvatica wood, the activity of cellulose and xylan-degrading enzymes was significantly higher in beech wood than in birch wood. Spatial analysis of a sample B. pendula log segment proved that F. fomentarius was the single fungal representative found in the log. There was a high level of spatial variability in the amount of fungal biomass detected, but no effects on enzyme activities were observed. Samples from the fruiting body showed high $\beta$-glucosidase and chitinase activities compared to wood samples. Significantly higher levels of xylanase and cellobiohydrolase were found in samples located near the fruitbody (proximal), and higher laccase and Mn-peroxidase activities were found in the distal ones. The microbial community in wood was dominated by the fungus (fungal to bacterial DNA ratio of 62-111). Bacterial abundance composition was lower in proximal than distal parts of wood by a factor of 24. These results show a significant level of spatial heterogeneity in coarse wood. One of the explanations may be the successive colonization of wood by the fungus: due to differential enzyme production, the rates of biodegradation of coarse wood are also spatially inhomogeneous. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

To this end, we determined the effects of the tree species composition on the biomass and composition of the soil microbial community using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles in the Hainich National Park, a deciduous mixed forest on loess over limestone in Central-Germany. We investigated the effects of the leaf litter composition on the microbial community, hypothesizing that distinctive leaf litter compositions increase signature PLFAs. In addition, we studied the impact of clay content, pH and nutrient status of the soil on the microbial community in different surface soil layers. Consequently, soil was sampled from depths of 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm and 10-20 cm. Plots with highest leaf litter diversity had the largest total amounts of fatty acids, but only PLFA 16:1$\omega$5, which is a common marker for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, was significantly increased. In the uppermost soil layer, the pH explained most of the variance in microbial composition. In the deeper surface soil layers, nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus determined the microbial abundances and composition. Our results suggest that the soil microbial community is mainly indirectly influenced by aboveground diversity. Changes in soil pH or the soil nutrient status that are driven by specific plant traits like leave litter quality drive these indirect changes. Specific direct interactions are most reasonable for mycorrhizal fungi. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Allelopathy is one of the factors that determine interactions among plants. Allelochemicals have been found in many forest ecosystems, but the importance of allelopathy depends on forest type and environmental conditions. Despite the wide presence of this phenomenon, few forest models have incorporated a representation of allelopathy, but its inclusion should be considered in forest models dealing with environmental stress, exotic plant invasions and ecological succession. Multiple factors influence allelochemical production and toxicity, including nutrient availability, soil moisture and texture, solar radiation, and temperature. Ecosystem-level effects of allelopathy include changes in germination rates, inhibition of seedling growth, mycorrhizal function, insect and bacterial growth, inhibition of nitrification or litterfall decomposition and dieback of mature trees. To illustrate some potential consequences of incorporation some aspects of allelopathy, in an ecosystem-level model, a virtual experiment was carried out with the forest ecosystem-level model FORECAST. This revealed different effects of allelopathy on several ecological variables depending on the type of allelopathic influence simulated. In addition, this experiment showed the utility of ecosystem-level models to simulate, if not directly the allelopathic interactions, at least the ecological effects of allelopathy at the ecosystem level. Overall, my work points out that researchers and forest managers should think carefully about the need to include allelopathy as a way of improving the accuracy of forest models and ecosystem-based decision support tools. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The response of ectomycorrhizal fungi after a precipitation event is crucial to understanding biogeochemical cycles and plant nutrition. Here, we examined changes in ectomycorrhizal formation, diversity, and community composition at the end of a summer drought and following precipitation events in a conifer–oak mixed forest under a semiarid, Mediterranean-type climate in CA, USA. To study the effects of different amounts of precipitation, a water addition treatment was also undertaken. Ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and community composition changed within 6 days following precipitation, with increased simultaneous mortality and re-growth. Ectomycorrhizal diversity increased and community composition changed both in the natural rainfall (less than 10 mm) and water addition (50 mm) treatments, but larger decreases in ectomycorrhizal diversity were observed from 9 to 16 days after precipitation in the water addition treatment. The changes were primarily a shift in richness and abundance of Basidiomycota species, indicating higher drought sensitivity of Basidiomycota species compared with Ascomycota species. Our results indicate that ectomycorrhizal formation, diversity, and community composition rapidly respond to both precipitation events and to the amount of precipitation. These changes affect ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling, decomposition, and plant nutrient uptake, in semiarid regions. {\textcopyright} 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract = {The soil is a heterogeneous medium with respect to decomposition activity and consequently with respect to nutrient availability. Roots of forest trees and hyphae of vesiculararbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi, principal nutrient absorbing organs, have previously been observed to associate with decomposing organic matter and other localized sites of nutrient availability in the soil. In two experiments in forests on contrasting soil types in Brazilian Amazonia, the association of tree roots with decomposing organic matter was shown to be a response of new root growth in the organic matter, not an avoidance of unfavorable conditions elsewhere in the soil volume. In laboratory experiments, the growth of VAM fungal hyphae was shown to respond to particles of decomposing organic matter in a way analogous to the response of forest tree roots. In both cases localized nutrient-rich sites (organic matter) were encountered by random growth of individual roots (hyphae) followed by increased branching after the encounter. Length of roots (and probably of hyphae) followed the negative binomial distribution, which is also found in other spatially aggregated organisms in heterogeneous environments. Although roots and hyphae operate in different size scales, the selective exploitation of localized nutrient-rich sites and the mechanism by which the advantageous physical placement comes about is strikingly similar. The highly branched roots and hyphae in association with decomposing organic matter should be advantageous when ion uptake is limited by either diffusion rate or competition with other organisms. {\textcopyright} 1983 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W.

The lowest species diversity was found in P. sylvestris stands situated in areas with high atmospheric deposition of nitrogen originating from intensive livestock industry. In these stands, litter and humus have accumulated into thick layers, and the herbaceous understory vegetation is dominated by the grass Deschampsia flexuosa (wavy hair grass). Earlier investigations showed negative correlations between the number of species of ectomycorrhizal fungi above ground and the depth of humus layers. Our aim was to investigate whether removal of litter, humus layers, and herbaceous vegetation (sods)-so-called 'sod cutting'-increased species diversity above ground and sporocarp density of ectomycorrhizal fungi in P. sylvestris stands of different age. Therefore, three P. sylvestris stands of different ages (planted in 1987, 1963, and 1924) on Haplic Arenosol were selected. In 1990, litter, humus layers, and herbaceous vegetation were removed to create nutrient-poor sandy soils without overlying litter and humus layers. Untreated plots served as controls. Surveys conducted in 1991, 1992, and 1993 indicated that sod cutting enhanced the species diversity and sporocarp density of ectomycorrhizal fungi. These results suggest that sod cutting is a way to restore ectomycorrhizal flora in medium-aged and old stands of P. sylvestris where litter and humus have accumulated.},

abstract = {Plant seasonal cycles alter carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) availability for soil microbes, which may affect microbial community composition and thus feed back on microbial decomposition of soil organic material and plant N availability. The temporal dynamics of these plant-soil interactions are, however, unclear. Here, we experimentally manipulated the C and N availability in a beech forest through N fertilization or tree girdling and conducted a detailed analysis of the seasonal pattern of microbial community composition and decomposition processes over 2 yr. We found a strong relationship between microbial community composition and enzyme activities over the seasonal course. Phenoloxidase and peroxidase activities were highest during late summer, whereas cellulase and protease peaked in late autumn. Girdling, and thus loss of mycorrhiza, resulted in an increase in soil organic matter-degrading enzymes and a decrease in cellulase and protease activity. Temporal changes in enzyme activities suggest a switch of the main substrate for decomposition between summer (soil organic matter) and autumn (plant litter). Our results indicate that ectomycorrhizal fungi are possibly involved in autumn cellulase and protease activity. Our study shows that, through belowground C allocation, trees significantly alter soil microbial communities, which may affect seasonal patterns of decomposition processes. {\textcopyright} The Authors (2010).

abstract = {Fine root processes play a prominent role in the carbon and nutrient cycling of boreal ecosystems due to the high proportion of biomass allocated belowground and the rapid decomposition of fine roots relative to aboveground tissues. To examine these issues in detail, major components of ecosystem carbon flux were studied in three mature black spruce forests in interior Alaska, where fine root production, respiration, mortality and decomposition, and aboveground production of trees, shrubs, and mosses were measured relative to soil CO2 fluxes. Fine root production, measured over a two-year period using minirhizotrons, varied from 0.004 ± 0.001 mm{\textperiodcentered}cm -2{\textperiodcentered}d-1 over winter, to 0.051 ± 0.015 mm{\textperiodcentered}cm-2{\textperiodcentered}d-1 during July, with peak growing season values comparable to those reported for many temperate forests using similar methods. On average, 84% of this production occurred within 20 cm of the moss surface, although the proportion occurring in deeper profiles increased as soils gradually warmed throughout the summer. Monthly rates of production and mortality were somewhat asynchronous because mortality tended to peak during fall and be minimal during periods of peak production. Production and mortality were, however, positively correlated across all tubes and time periods. Annual fine root production averaged 2.45 ± 0.31, 8.01 ± 1.39, and 2.53 ± 0.27 mm{\textperiodcentered}cm-2{\textperiodcentered}yr-1 (means ± 1 SE) among the three sites, when averaged across years. Fine root survival and decomposition were measured by tracking and analyzing the fate of individual fine roots using mark-recapture techniques. Fine root survival was greatest during periods of peak root growth, and least over winter ($\Phi$time). Roots first appearing in the middle of the growing season had higher survival rates than those first appearing early or late in the growing season, or over winter ($\Phi$cohort), and risk of mortality decreased with root age ($\Phi$age). Survival estimates translate to mean life spans of 108 ± 4 d during the growing season. While these values are in striking contrast to needle longevity and rates of aboveground litter decomposition, they are similar to many values found for temperate systems, supporting the notion that there are basic morphological and physiological traits of first-order roots that are common to most woody plant root systems. During the growing season, monthly fine root decomposition rates averaged 0.46 ± 0.01 per month, while decomposition rates over winter averaged 0.73 ± 0.01 per winter. These growing season estimates translate to 49 ± 2 d from the time a root was first observed as dead, to the time it disappeared. For roots that decomposed during the growing season, those with longer life spans decomposed more slowly after death. Comparing these results with other minirhizotron studies suggests that life-history traits of black spruce first-order roots are similar to those from temperate (and perhaps most) forest ecosystems. Annual production of fine roots averaged 228 ± 75 g biomass{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}yr-1, constituting ∼56% of total stand production. Aboveground production of trees (50 ± 14 g biomass{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}yr-1, 13%) and shrubs (40 ± 2 g biomass{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}yr -1, 11%) contributed similarly to total production, while mosses (73 ± 14 g biomass{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}yr-1, 20%) accounted for the largest component of aboveground production. Soil temperature had a strong control over both soil respiration (Q10 = 2.21 ± 0.31) and root respiration (Q10 = 2.30 ± 0.37). During the growing season (15 May to 15 September), ∼56% of soil CO2 efflux (580 ± 40 g C/m2) was derived from fine root respiration (329 ± 54 g C/m2). Although apparent rates of heterotrophic respiration (May through September) and total production did not differ, definitive estimates of net ecosystem production are impossible given the potentially large, unmeasured components of NPP (net primary production), such as root exudation and mycorrhizal production. Nevertheless, rates of fine root production, mortality, and decomposition indicate that in these black spruce ecosystems, fine roots are much more dynamic than would be predicted from patterns of aboveground processes, and that carbon, and presumably nutrients, are cycling through fine roots at rates several orders of magnitude faster than through aboveground tissues.},

abstract = {Soil nutrient availability can strongly affect root traits. In tropical forests, phosphorus (P) is often considered the main limiting nutrient for plants. However, support for the P paradigm is limited, and N and cations might also control tropical forests functioning. We used a large-scale experiment to determine how the factorial addition of nitrogen (N), P and cations affected root productivity and traits related to nutrient acquisition strategies (morphological traits, phosphatase activity, arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation and nutrient contents) in a primary rainforest growing on low-fertility soils in Central Amazonia after 1 yr of fertilisation. Multiple root traits and productivity were affected. Phosphorus additions increased annual root productivity and root diameter, but decreased root phosphatase activity. Cation additions increased root productivity at certain times of year, also increasing root diameter and mycorrhizal colonisation. P and cation additions increased their element concentrations in root tissues. No responses were detected with N addition. Here we showed that rock-derived nutrients determined root functioning in low-fertility Amazonian soils, demonstrating not only the hypothesised importance of P, but also highlighting the role of cations. The changes in fine root traits and productivity indicated that even slow-growing tropical rainforests can respond rapidly to changes in resource availability. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Authors.

abstract = {The mechanistic links between nitrogen (N) availability and investment in plant phosphorus (P) acquisition have important implications for plant growth, species distributions, and responses to CO2 fertilization under global change, especially in P-poor tropical ecosystems. Currently, it is unclear whether investment in strategies that enhance plant P acquisition (arbuscular mycorrhizal, AM; colonization or root phosphatase activity, RPA) are determined primarily by phylogeny, or whether these strategies differ among N2-fixing legumes and nonfixing plants as a result of differing N availability. We hypothesized that plant N status, which can vary widely independent of N fixation, correlates with investment in P acquisition, because: (a) N and P concentrations scale in plant tissue indicative of coupled demand and (b) plants with more N may have more resources available to allocate to acquisition strategies. We grew seedlings of eight tropical tree species from three families (including three N2-fixing and one nonfixing legume) under greenhouse conditions in native forest soil for four months. Species represented almost the full range of foliar N observed in tropical trees. Neither foliar N nor P concentrations correlated with investment in P acquisition. Across all species, we found an inverse relationship between investment in AM colonization and RPA, but this trade-off was unrelated to foliar N or P and did not differ between functional types (i.e., N2 fixers vs. nonfixers). Within legumes (family Fabaceae), two strategies were evident that were unrelated to fixation status. High-fixing Inga and nonfixing Dialium displayed high foliar N and P concentrations and greater proportional investment in RPA versus AM, while lower fixing Ormosia species were characterized by lower foliar nutrient concentrations and proportionally more investment in AM. Synthesis.Investment in P acquisition strategies in tropical trees is not dependent on foliar N or functional group, but instead may be controlled in part by resource trade-offs. High diversity in nutrient strategies between related species cautions again the use of simple functional groupings to draw conclusions about nutrient acquisition in tropical trees. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors.

abstract = {Forest ecosystems with low soil nitrogen (N) availability are characterized by direct competition for this growth-limiting resource between several players, i.e. various components of vegetation, such as old-growth trees, natural regeneration and understorey species, mycorrhizal fungi, free-living fungi and bacteria. With the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme climate events predicted in current climate change scenarios, also competition for N between plants and/or soil microorganisms will be affected. In this review, we summarize the present understanding of ecosystem N cycling in N-limited forests and its interaction with extreme climate events, such as heat, drought and flooding. More specifically, the impacts of environmental stresses on microbial release and consumption of bioavailable N, N uptake and competition between plants, as well as plant and microbial uptake are presented. Furthermore, the consequences of drying-wetting cycles on N cycling are discussed. Additionally, we highlight the current methodological difficulties that limit present understanding of N cycling in forest ecosystems and the need for interdisciplinary studies. {\textcopyright} 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.},

abstract = {Fires are critical pathways of carbon loss from boreal forest soils, whereas microbial communities form equally critical controls over carbon accumulation between fires. We used a chronosequence in Alaska to test Read's hypothesis that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi should dominate ecosystems with low accumulation of surface litter, and ectomycorrhizal fungi should proliferate where organic horizons are well-developed. This pattern is expected because ectomycorrhizal fungi display a greater capacity to mineralize organic compounds than do arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The sites were located in upland forests near Delta Junction, Alaska, and represent stages at 3, 15, 45, and 80 years following fire. Soil organic matter accumulated 2.8-fold over time. Fire did not noticeably reduce the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In contrast, ectomycorrhizal colonization required up to 15 years to return to pre-fire levels. As a result, dominant mycorrhizal groups shifted from arbuscular to ectomycorrhizal fungi as succession progressed. Bacterial functional diversity was greatest in the oldest sites. Altogether, microbes that can mineralize organic compounds (i.e., ectomycorrhizae and bacteria) recovered more slowly than those that cannot (i.e., arbuscular mycorrhizae). Potential net N mineralization and standing pools of ammonium-N were relatively low in the youngest site. In addition, glomalin stocks were positively correlated with arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal length, peaking early in the chronosequence. Our results indicate that microbial succession may influence soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in the first several years following fire, by augmenting carbon storage in glomalin while inhibiting mineralization of organic compounds.},

Mounds had a positive effect on root development, ectomycorrhiza formation and the absorption of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the seedlings, and augmented their survival, growth and biomass. Humus removal had an adverse effect on the root biomass and ectomycorrhiza formation. A decreased soil fertility after the removal of humus led to a low N and P content in the seedlings. Two years after planting, humus removal had not affected the growth of the seedlings, but reduced their biomass. The influence of the forest edge, compared to the interior plot, was mostly associated with a decrease in the stand density, reduced amount of litter and increased light availability for the seedlings. {\textcopyright} 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Down wood can serve as reservoirs for moisture and mycorrhizal fungi beneficial to the health and growth of commercial tree species. Decaying wood, leaf litter, small twigs, and roots contribute nutrients and structure to humus and soil organic matter, and host microbes that play beneficial roles in nitrogen cycles and other processes. Snags and down wood provide nurse functions for tree and shrub species, and can aid in restoration of degraded forest environments. Various elements of wood decay provide habitat for many species of wildlife including invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Fire can influence the amounts and distributions of wood decay elements and enhance or detract desired ecosystem processes, depending on severity, charring, soil temperature, and other factors.

abstract = {A survey of the biodiversity of wild macrofungi, including edible species yields, was carried out from 1 May to 30 September 2007 at four different forest types (in mainly Miang tea forest). The plots 100 m2, comprised a tea garden with a few planted canopy tree species (37.2% canopy cover), a cultivated sustainable tea forest (80.2% canopy cover), an abandoned sustainable tea forest (89.8% canopy cover), and an abandoned sustainable tea forest that had suffered fire damage (72.9% canopy cover). All visible mushrooms were collected during weekly forays. Macro-characters of the fungi were annotated and photographed by digital camera and the fungi were identified to genera and morphospecies (e.g. Agaricus sp.1, Agaricus sp.2). The fresh weight of wild edible mushrooms produced in the plots was also recorded during this period. The biodiversity of macrofungi in abandoned sustainable tea forest was highest with 115 species in 47 genera, followed by cultivated sustainable tea forest with 85 species in 42 genera and fire damaged abandoned sustainable tea forest with 48 species in 25 genera, while only 19 species belonging to 15 genera were found in the tea garden. Twenty-one species belonging to nine genera with a total of 60.9 kg of edible fungi were collected throughout this study. The fresh weight of edible mushrooms was recorded with the highest fresh weight (25.3 kg) collected from the abandoned sustainable tea forest, followed by 18.2 kg in the cultivated sustainable tea forest, while in the fire damaged sustainable tea forest 16.4 kg were collected and only 1 kg was collected in the tea garden. Abandoned sustainable tea forest contained a greater shade tree biodiversity and higher canopy cover than other plots. This area has a generally higher humidity, a greater ground litter cover, a greater number of microhabitats, a greater number of trees that can form mycorrhizal associations and this probably accounts for the higher diversity of macrofungi and production of edible mushrooms. The fire damaged sustainable tea forest had lower mushroom diversity and edible mushroom production possibly due to the loss of litter and lower tree diversity. The tea garden supported a poor diversity of mushrooms and almost no edible mushrooms. Shade tea forest (Miang tea forest) is a good method to produce tea in a sustainable way as it maintains diversity of mushrooms and other organisms and could be developed as an alternative to shade coffee. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

Average total C and nonpolar extractives were higher in young stands (15-55 years) (mean = 53.38%, 95% CI of 52.48-54.27 and mean = 8.54%, 95% CI of 6.92-10.16, respectively) compared with old-growth stands (200-500 years) (mean = 51.22%, 95% CI of 49.67-52.77 and mean = 6.75%, 95% CI of 5.88-7.62, respectively).

No differences between log decay class or stand age were detected for water-soluble extractives, hemicellulose plus cellulose (or acid-hydrolyzable fraction), or acid-unhydrolyzable residue. Observed differences in average wood property values between decay stages and between young and old-growth stands were small and, although statistically significant, may not reflect an important difference in EM fungal habitat. EM communities were similar between young and old-growth stands and between logs in decay classes 4 and 5. Results suggest that down wood in advanced decay stages provides similar habitat for EM fungi in both old-growth and young, managed stands. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC.},

The mycelium of P. involutus foraged intensively in all three types of litter, leading to a significant decline in their phosphorus contents after 90 d. Over the same period only one of the litter types, beech, showed more than a 10% loss of its N contents. Exploitation of the litter led to invigoration of the vegetative mycelium of the fungus throughout the chambers as well as to significant increases of biomass production and leaf area in seedlings grown in the plus litter (+L) relative to those in minus litter (-L) systems. The yield increases were associated with gains in whole plant tissue content and concentration of P, but in content only in the case of N. Calculations suggest that a major proportion of the phosphorus lost from litter originated in its organic fraction. The possible basis of the discrepancy between values of N loss from litter and gain by the plant is discussed and the extent to which the distinctive pattern of nutrient mobilization is a feature peculiar to this fungus-plant combination is considered. It is concluded that nutrient mobilization from natural organic substrates in the fermentation horizon of forest soils may be a key function of the vegetative mycelium of mycorrhizal systems. The need for experimental analyses of a greater range of fungus-plant partnerships is stressed.},

We investigated this indirect interaction using a causal modelling approach. We identified ECM fungi on the roots of two coexisting oak species growing in two forests in southern Spain - Quercus suber (evergreen) and Quercus canariensis (winter deciduous)-using a PCR-based molecular method. We also analysed the leaf fall, litter and soil sampled beneath the tree canopies to determine the concentrations of key nutrients. The total mycorrhizal pool was comprised of 69 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Tomentella and Russula were the most species-rich, frequent and abundant genera. ECM fungi with epigeous and resupinate fruiting bodies were found in 60% and 34% of the identified mycorrhizas, respectively. The calcium content of litter, which was significantly higher beneath the winter-deciduous oak species due to differences in leaf fall quality, was the most important variable for explaining ECM species distribution. The evaluation of alternative causal models by the d-sep method revealed that only those considering indirect leaf fall-mediated host effects statistically matched the observed covariation patterns between host, environment (litter, topsoil, subsoil) and fungal community variables. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi from Pinus yunnanensis forests, a dominant vegetation type in central Yunnan and adjacent regions, were sampled from 2000-2005. A total of 834 mushroom collections representing 211 taxa in 39 genera and 27 families were obtained and identified. Of these, Russula, Boletus, Lactarius, Suillus, Tricholoma, Cantharellus and Thelephora were the dominant genera. Our ecological surveys indicate that EM fungal fruiting and distribution patterns are strongly affected by climate (e. g., air temperature and precipitation), vegetation (e. g., stand age, crown density and herbaceous vegetation); soil conditions (e. g., pH; litter and humus layers), topographic features (e. g., altitude; position and steepness of slopes) and human disturbance (e. g., commercial harvesting; logging; fire and residue removal). The 4 primary findings were: (1) There was a consistent seasonal variation in the number of EM fungi associated with Pinus yunnanensis. Over the 5-year period; the lowest numbers of EM fungi were found during the winter months of January; February; and March. This number rose rapidly during the spring and peaked in mid and late summer. (2)The abundance; composition; and richness of EM fungi significantly increased with increasing altitude between 1500-2100 m; and then slightly decreased up to 2500 m. Usually a species was found only within a particular range of altitudes. (3) EM fungal richness increases as the host matures. The tendency is to find greater numbers of EM species associated with older Pinus yunnanensis stands. This increase in EM fungi with maturing of host stands may be related to changes in available photosynthate; root exudates and soil conditions. (4) Human disturbance has a major negative impact on EM fungi species richness; abundance; and community composition. Large-scale harvesting directly affected the production of fruit bodies; either by damaging or exhausting mycelia; shifting competitive relations with other species; or by causing reproductive failure due to decreased spore production. EM fungi richness declined with increased fire severity and logging intensity. Both litter and humus layers and grass density appeared to affect sporocarp production with litter depth and EM fungi sporocarp abundance being negatively correlated. Sporocarps of EM fungi were scarce in Pinus yunnanensis stands dominated by the grass Eupatorium adenophorum.},

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are root symbionts that might improve the ability of plants to compete for organic nitrogen products against other decomposer microbes. However, AM uptake of organic nitrogen, especially in natural systems, has traditionally been difficult to test. We developed a novel quantitative nanotechnological technique to determine in situ that organic nitrogen uptake by AM fungi can occur to a greater extent than has previously been assumed. Specifically, we found that AM fungi acquired recalcitrant and labile forms of organic nitrogen. Moreover, N enrichment of soil reduced plot-scale uptake of these compounds. Since most plants host AM fungi, AM use of organic nitrogen could widely influence plant productivity, especially where N availability is relatively low. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A Mg isotope study of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) in a field site in southern Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada, and seedlings grown in sterile soil substrate in the laboratory, both demonstrate per mil level within-tree Mg isotope fractionation. However, only sugar maple seedlings grown in the laboratory fractionate Mg isotopes during uptake into fine roots, favoring heavy isotope enrichment in the plant compared to the growth medium. Absence of uptake-related Mg isotope fractionation in field stands of sugar maple is tentatively attributed to the activities of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that colonize fine roots of the trees in the field, but were absent from the laboratory grown specimens. The fungi facilitate nutrient uptake for the tree, while the tree provides valuable carbohydrates to the fungi. Without the symbiotic fungi, pot-grown trees in the laboratory are visibly stressed and often die. The mechanisms responsible for Mg isotopic fractionation in stressed trees remain to be elucidated. Rivers are isotopically light compared to bedrock weathering sources of Mg, and this has bearing on the $\delta$26Mg value of the continental weathering flux of Mg to the oceans, which is an important parameter in studies of ocean Mg cycling in the geological past. If uptake-related fractionation is negligible in many other naturally growing tree species, as it is in sugar maple, then forest growth will exert little or no influence on the $\delta$26Mg value of the export flux of Mg to first-order streams and rivers, and in turn the ocean Mg cycle. Above the tree line, preferential retention of heavy Mg isotopes in clay minerals formed during silicate weathering has been linked to the low $\delta$26Mg values in rivers. In the forested catchment of this study there is no clear evidence for these effects. The 1 N HNO3 leach of the Bf-BC and C mineral soils, which are often used to identify minerals that may be releasing Mg and other base cations to plant-available pools, have the same average $\delta$26Mg value (−0.66‰, n = 2) as the litter layer and exchangeable leach of the forest floor, all soil solutions, and the stream (−0.63 ± 0.17‰ 2$\sigma$, n = 23). More revealing is the molar Mg/Ca ratio of the 1 N HNO3 treatment (0.17), which is nearly identical to the bulk Mg/Ca ratio of the aboveground biomass (0.14). We conclude that the 1 N HNO3 leach in this setting releases Mg from secondary minerals, such as vermiculite, other clays, and amorphous phases, which have taken up plant-recycled Mg and Ca that has filtered down through the soil from the litter layer of the forest floor. A single mineral, chlorite, with an estimated $\delta$26Mg value of −0.78‰, appears to be responsible for supplying most of the Mg that is circulating between the forest and soils in this setting, which is weathered and cached over timescales of thousands of years. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Background and aim – Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities are a main component of soil. They could be an indicator of fertility of semi-arid ecosystems. We aimed to analyse the biodiversity of AMF and understorey plants in Zagros forest (Iran), and to find their relationships with environmental conditions (physiography and soil). Methods – Seventy-five plots (20 m × 20 m) were randomly divided from 1 700 to 1 900 m a.s.l. In each plot, four 1.5 m × 1.5 m microplots were established and all trees, shrubs, and herbaceous species coverage were recorded. Furthermore, four soil samples were taken from a depth of 0–20 cm in each microplot (one pooled sample for each main plot) by auger in spring. These soil samples were used for AMF assessment and soil physiochemical properties. Results – Seventeen AMF species (in Glomeraceae, Claroideoglomeraceae, Diversisporaceae, Gigasporaceae, and Acaulosporaceae) and 47 plant taxa (in Poaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae and fourteen other families) were identified. Tests determined that the factors soil P, slope, tree coverage, litter thickness, and soil texture affect AMF and plant communities. Soil physiochemical properties have an effect on AMF, plant diversity, and evenness diversity indices. Furthermore, there is a high correlation between plants and AMF diversity indices and any change in the plant diversity will result in AMF changes. The results also showed positive correlations between plant diversity and AMF diversity. Conclusions – AMF and plant diversity indices are highly correlated, but this correlation could be affected by soil physiochemical properties and environmental factors. Moreover, canopy coverage and litter thickness are considered as strongly influencing both plants and AMF. {\textcopyright} 2017 Botanic Garden Meise and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.

abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal mycelial necromass is an important source of carbon for free-living microorganisms in forest soils, yet we know little either of its fate when it enters soil or of the identity of microbes that are able to utilise mycelium as their energy source. Here we used 13C-labelled mycelium of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus microcarpus in laboratory incubations in combination with DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) to determine the identity of functionally active soil fungi that can utilise dead mycelium. We also used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to detect parallel changes in the abundance of key biochemical constituents of soil. A decrease in bulk soil 13C concentration together with rapid loss of glycogen and chitin-glucan during the 4 week incubations suggested that dead mycelium was rapidly turned over. Further, 13C was incorporated into fungal DNA within 7 days of addition to soil. DNA-SIP also revealed a dynamic community of functionally active soil fungi. By applying DNA-SIP and NMR in parallel, our data show that carbon from decaying ectomycorrhizal mycelium is rapidly transformed and incorporated into free-living soil fungi. This finding emphasises that dead extra-matrical mycelium is an important source of labile carbon for soil microorganisms. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The neodymium isotope ratios (143Nd/144Nd) and rare earth element compositions of eight plant species in a wellstudied Ca-depleted research forest (the Strengbach catchment) were measured. The 143Nd/144Nd ratios distributed between the higher ratio of apatite and the lower ratio of plagioclase. The ratio correlated well with the type of infected fungi. Ectomycorrhizae (EM)-infected plants tended to show lower isotope ratios than Ect-uninfected plants. This is supported by the REE abundance patterns: Higher 143Nd/144Nd plants tend to show a more negative Eu anomaly. Based on the reported soil profile, the Nd isotope ratio of the surface soil is considered to be influenced significantly by Nd in plant litter. Combining Nd isotope and Eu anomaly data, the REE cycle in the catchment can largely be understood by mixing three endmembers of Ca-bearing plagioclase, apatite and carbonate in loess. EM-infected plants are estimated to incorporate 50-70% of Nd ultimately from plagioclase, whereas for non EM-infected plants, less than 30% of Nd is from plagioclase, perhaps indirectly from the recycled pool. Comparison of the results with reported mineral soil profiles and REE composition of acid leachates of soil indicates that plagioclase is dissolved by the symbiotic action of ectomycorrhizae, providing a direct evidence of active plant-induced weathering in a natural system. It is likely that plants dissolve plagioclase to compensate for insufficient Ca in soil. {\textcopyright} 2017 by The Geochemical Society of Japan.},

In this study, we examined the immediate effect of a major hurricane on aboveground forest structure, arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) and belowground carbon pools in experimentally thinned plots in a tropical forest. The hurricane occurred five years after a thinning treatment, when thinned plots had similar aboveground carbon stocks but different forest structure compared to control plots. Thinned plots had more large diameter (>10 cm) trees compared to the control plots, which were characterized by a higher density of small diameter (<10 cm) trees. Despite pre-hurricane differences in forest structure, there were no significant differences between treatments in changes of canopy openness or number of affected trees following the hurricane. Thinned plots had larger belowground carbon pools than the controls plots before the hurricane, and these differences remained after the hurricane despite rapid decomposition of organic matter rich in nitrogen. There were no pre-hurricane differences in AM fungal spores or total AM root colonization. The hurricane reduced AM sporulation by nearly 50% in both treatments, yet we observed a significant increase in AM root colonization after the hurricane with greater AM colonization in the thinned plots. Hurricanes have well-known visible aboveground effects, but here we showed that less visible belowground effects are influenced by forest management and may play an important role in forest recovery. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

abstract = {In this article we discuss the possible significance of biological processes, and of fungi in particular, in weathering of minerals. We consider biological activity to be a significant driver of mineral weathering in forest ecosystems. In these environments fungi play key roles in organic matter decomposition, uptake, transfer and cycling of organic and inorganic nutrients, biogenic mineral formation, as well as transformation and accumulation of metals. The ability of lichens, mutualistic symbioses between fungi and photobionts such as algae or cyanobacteria, to weather minerals is well documented. The role of mycorrhizal fungi forming symbioses with forest trees is less well understood, but the mineral horizons of boreal forests are intensively colonised by mycorrhizal mycelia which transfer protons and organic metabolites derived from plant photosynthates to mineral surfaces, resulting in mineral dissolution and mobilisation and redistribution of anionic nutrients and metal cations. The mycorrhizal mycelia, in turn provide efficient systems for the uptake and direct transport of mobilised essential nutrients to their host plants which are large sinks. Since almost all (99.99. %) non-suberised lateral plant roots involved in nutrient uptake are covered by ectomycorrhizal fungi, most of this exchange of metabolites must take place through the plant-fungus interface. This idea is still consistent with a linear relationship between soil mineral surface area and weathering rate since the mycelia that emanate from the tree roots will have a larger area of contact with minerals if the mineral surface area is higher. Although empirical models based on bulk soil solution chemistry may fit field data, we argue that biological processes make an important contribution to mineral weathering and that a more detailed mechanistic understanding of these must be developed in order to predict responses to environmental changes and anthropogenic impact. {\textcopyright} 2010 The British Mycological Society.},

abstract = {Forest replacement by exotic plantations drive important changes at the level of the overstory, understory and forest floor. In the Atlantic Forest of northern Argentina, large areas have been replaced by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) monocultures. Plant and litter transformation, together with harvesting operations, change microclimatic conditions and edaphic properties. Management practices such as thinning promote the development of native understory vegetation and could counterbalance negative effects of forest replacement on soil. Here, the effects of pine plantations and thinning on physical, chemical and microbiological soil properties were assessed. Bacterial, archaeal, and fungal community structure were analyzed using a metabarcoding approach targeting ribosomal markers. Forest replacement and, to a lesser extent, thinning practices in the pine plantations induced significant changes in soil physico-chemical properties and associated shifts in bacterial and fungal communities. Most measured physical and chemical properties were altered due to forest replacement, but a few of these properties reached values similar to natural forests under the thinning operation. Fungal alpha diversity decreased in pine plantations, whereas bacterial alpha diversity tended to increase but with little statistical support. Shifts in community composition were observed for both fungal and bacterial domains, and were mostly related to changes in plant understory composition, soil carbon, organic matter, water content, pH and bulk density. Among several other changes, highly abundant phyla such as Proteobacteria (driven by many genera) and Mortierellomycota (mainly driven by Mortierella) decreased in relative abundance in the plantations, whereas Acidobacteria (mainly driven by Acidothermus and Candidatus Koribacter) and Basidiomycota (mainly driven by the ectomycorrhiza Russula) showed the opposite response. Taken together, these results provide insights into the effects of forest replacement on belowground properties and elucidate the potentially beneficial effect of thinning practices in intensive plantation systems through promoting the understory development. Although thinning did not entirely counterbalance the effects of forest replacement on physical, chemical and biological soil properties, the strategy helped mitigating the effects and might promote resilience of these properties by the end of the rotation cycle, if subsequent management practices compatible with the development of a native understory vegetation are applied. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020 Trentini, Campanello, Villagra, Ferreras and Hartmann.},

The majority of this activity was in the first 6 cm. Fruitbodies were analyzed for radiocesium and 40K by means of gamma-spectrometry. The highest 137Cs activity was 54.1 ± 0.7 kBq/kg (dry weight) for a sample of Lactarius helvus collected in 2006. The results for 2006 were higher than those for 2007. In a few cases the traces of short-lived (T1/2 = 2.06 a) 134Cs were still found in samples. The importance of mycorrhizal fungi for radiocesium accumulation is confirmed. The differences in activity among the species are discussed in relation to observations and predictions from previous studies, where the change in relative accumulation between fruiting bodies of different species was at least partially explained by the differences in the depth of the mycelium localization in a litter/soil system. It is concluded that in some cases, such as Boletus edulis and Xerocomus badius, this prediction is fulfilled and therefore this explanation confirmed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

While the causes of greater root production at deeper soil depths under elevated CO2 concentration ([CO2]) require further investigation, altered rooting distributions are expected to affect important ecosystem processes. The depth at which fine roots are produced may influence root chemistry, physiological function, and mycorrhizal infection, leading to altered nitrogen (N) uptake rates and slower turnover. Also, soil processes such as microbial decomposition are slowed at depth in the soil, potentially affecting the rate at which root detritus becomes incorporated into soil organic matter. Deeper rooting distributions under elevated [CO2] provide exciting opportunities to use novel sensors and chemical analyses throughout the soil profile to track the effects of root proliferation on carbon (C) and N cycling. Models do not currently incorporate information on root turnover and C and N cycling at depth in the soil, and modification is necessary to accurately represent processes associated with altered rooting depth distributions. Progress in understanding and modeling the interface between deeper rooting distributions under elevated [CO2] and soil C and N cycling will be critical in projecting the sustainability of forest responses to rising atmospheric [CO2]. {\textcopyright} The Authors (2010).

abstract = {Tropical forests have high rates of soil carbon cycling, but little information is available on how roots, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and free-living microorganisms interact and influence organic matter mineralization in these ecosystems. We used mesh ingrowth cores and isotopic tracers in phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers to investigate the effects of roots and AMF mycelia on (1) microbial community composition, microbial carbon utilization, and hydrolytic enzyme activities for large, potted tropical trees and (2) enzyme activities and litter mass loss in a lowland tropical forest. Under the tropical tree, plant-derived carbon was incorporated predominantly into bacterial groups in both rhizosphere and AMF-only soils. Gram-positive bacteria incorporated additional soil-derived carbon in rhizosphere soils, which also contained the highest microbial biomass. For hydrolytic enzymes, $\beta$-glucosidase and N-acetyl $\beta$-glucosaminidase activities were highest in rhizosphere soils, while phosphomonoesterase activity was highest in AMF-only soil. In the forest, leaf litter mass loss was increased by the presence of roots, but not by the presence of AMF mycelia only. Root-microbial interactions influenced organic matter cycling, with evidence for rhizosphere priming and accelerated leaf litter decomposition in the presence of roots. Although AMF mycelia alone did not stimulate organic matter mineralization, they were a conduit of carbon to other soil microorganisms. {\textcopyright} 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

abstract = {In this paper, we report the influence of pine, oak and spruce forest litter on the growth and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) formation of Scots pine seedlings after the first growing season in a bare-root forest nursery. The mixture of collected forest litters and humus were used to obtain a 20-cm mulching layer on the prepared seedbeds. The concentrations of all nutrients and the C/N ratio of growth media were significantly higher in forest litter treatments than in negative control represented by mineral soil without litter. Addition of each forest litter type significantly enhanced pine seedling height and root-collar diameter compared to negative control. A significant positive influence on dry mass of stem, needles, roots and total dry mass of the seedling has been found only for pine litter. Based on molecular identification, seven ECM fungal taxa (Wilcoxina mikolae, Suillus luteus, Cenococcum geophilum, Meliniomyces bicolor, Laccaria laccata, unidentified Atheliaceae, unidentified Ascomycetes) were distinguished in the observed mycorrhizal communities. Each forest litter type significantly increased the total number of mycorrhizal tips and ECM fungal diversity compared to the control soil. However, results showed a lack of significant differences in species composition and relative abundance of ECM fungi between different litter types. Such result suggests that forest litter has not been a key source of inoculum for tested fungal species, as root systems of all pine seedlings from different litter types were dominated by a few nurseryadapted ECM fungi, probably originating from natural air-borne inoculum. Our data rather indicate that forest litter considerably improves environmental conditions for development of ECM fungi previously present in the nursery soil. Therefore, any of the forest litter types used in our studies may be able to promote planting stock quality on a small scale in the nursery phase. {\textcopyright} SISEF.},

abstract = {Experiments with plant species that can host both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are important to separating the roles of fungal type and plant species and understanding the influence of the types of symbioses on plant growth and nutrient acquisition. We examined the effects of mycorrhizal fungal type on the growth and tissue nutrient content of two tree species (Eucalyptus grandis and Quercus costaricensis) grown under four nutrient treatments (combinations of low versus high nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) with different N:P ratios) in the greenhouse. Trees were inoculated with unidentified field mixtures of AMF or EMF species cultivated on root fragments of AMF- or EMF-specific bait plants. In E. grandis, inoculation with both AMF and EMF positively affected belowground plant dry weight and negatively affected aboveground dry weight, while only inoculation with AMF increased tissue nutrient content. Conversely, Q. costaricensis dry weight and nutrient content did not differ significantly among inoculation treatments, potentially due to its dependence on cotyledon reserves for growth. Mineral nutrition of both tree species differed with the ratio of N to P applied while growth did not. Our results demonstrate that both tree species' characteristics and the soil nutrient environment can affect how AMF and EMF interact with their host plants. This research highlights the importance of mycorrhizal fungal-tree-soil interactions during early seedling growth and suggests that differences between AMF and EMF associations may be crucial to understanding forest ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Turnover of fungal biomass in forest litter and soil represents an important process in the environment. To date, knowledge of mycelial decomposition has been derived primarily from short-term studies, and the guild of mycelium decomposers has been poorly defined. Here, we followed the fate of the fruiting bodies of an ectomycorrhizal fungus in litter and soil of a temperate forest over 21 wk. The community of associated microbes and enzymatic processes in this specific substrate were described. The decomposition of fungal fruiting bodies exhibited biphasic kinetics. The rapid initial phase, which included the disappearance of DNA, was followed by a slower turnover of the recalcitrant fraction. Compared with the surrounding litter and soil, the mycelium represented a hotspot of activity of several biopolymer-degrading enzymes and high bacterial biomass. Specific communities of bacteria and fungi were associated with decomposing mycelium. These communities differed between the initial and late phases of decomposition. The bacterial community associated with decomposing mycelia typically contained the genera Pedobacter, Pseudomonas, Variovorax, Chitinophaga, Ewingella and Stenotrophomonas, whereas the fungi were mostly nonbasidiomycetous r-strategists of the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, Mortierella, Cladosporium and several others. Decomposing ectomycorrhizal fungal mycelium exhibits high rates of decomposition and represents a specific habitat supporting a specific microbial community. {\textcopyright} 2016 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract = {Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is a process during which reactive N (including NH4 + and NO3 -) is deposited by the atmosphere into the soil and oceans. Over the last several decades, anthropogenic activities such as intensive agriculture and industry have caused a great increase in atmospheric N deposition. For example, the average N deposition rate in China has increased from 13.2 kg/hm2 in the 1980s to 21.1 kg/hm2 in the 2000s, and is projected to increase further in coming decades. Elevated N deposition will have many effects on forest ecosystems. Previous studies have shown that long-term N deposition will reduce plant diversity, inhibit the litter decomposition rate, change the soil microbial community structure, accelerate forest nitrogen saturation, cause soil acidification, and even alter the nutrient cycle. In recent years, the effects of atmospheric N deposition on the soil Phosphorus (P) cycle in forest ecosystems have received much attention, because P is one of the macronutrients essential to living organisms and is also the main limiting factor in most ecosystems. Although a series of studies were conducted that investigated the effect of N deposition on the soil P cycle in forest ecosystems, a general knowledge base has not yet been established. To rectify this, we used data from existing studies to summarize how N deposition affects the soil P cycle in forest ecosystems. The following aspects were described: 1) the concept of the soil P cycle in the context of forest ecosystems and 2) common methods used to study the effects of atmospheric N deposition on the forest soil P cycle, including long-term simulated N deposition, gradiated natural N deposition, and isotope tracing. In addition, 3) the results of previous studies on the effect of atmospheric N deposition on the forest soil P cycle were summarized. In general, atmospheric N deposition has a negative effect on the soil P cycle in forest ecosystems, in that it accelerates it. Three conclusions can be drawn about the effects of N deposition on three major soil P processes. I) Concerning the effect of N deposition on the P input in soil: litter production and the return of P from litter to soil generally depends on the initial soil N status. In "N-rich" soil, extra N input decreases litter production and inhibits the decomposition process, thus decreasing the rate of P return, whereas in "N-limited" soil, N input promotes these processes. II) Concerning the effect of N deposition on the internal transformation of soil P: long-term N deposition tends to weaken the mobility of P and decrease labile phosphate content. Microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP), an important source of labile soil phosphate in forests, also decreases under N deposition. III) Concerning the effect of N deposition on P output in the soil: when plant growth is limited by N, N deposition will stimulate plant uptake of P, and therefore increase the leaf P concentration while decreasing the leaf N/P ratio; however, when plant growth is not limited by N, N deposition will decrease plant uptake of P and thus the leaf P concentration, increase the leaf N/P ratio. Thus, we identified the major mechanisms driving changes in soil P cycling induced by N deposition. First, N deposition will directly alter the quality of the soil organic matter, such as the C: N: P ratio. High C/P and N/P ratios inhibit the decomposition process and the return of P to the soil. Second, N deposition alters microbial communities. Fungi, especially mycorrhizal fungi, are more sensitive to N deposition than bacteria. Third, N deposition alters soil P cycling by increasing the concentrations of base cations such as Fe3+, Al3+, and Mn2+, which bond with HPO4 2- and H2PO4 -. Finally, enzymes are also affected by N deposition. In N-saturated and P-limited soil, microbes and plant fine roots release phosphatase in order to accelerate the mineralization of organic phosphorus, which alleviate the soil P limitation. However, this increased phosphatase activity cannot not alter the low concentration of available P in the soil, because the mineralized available P will be taken up instantly by soil microbes and plant fine roots. Finally, we point out the limitations and problems with current studies, and suggest potential future avenues of research on the effects of N deposition on the forest soil P cycle. {\textcopyright} 2016, Ecological Society of China.

abstract = {Windstorm is one of the destructive natural disturbances, but the scale-link extent to which recurrent windstorms influenced forests ecosystems is poorly understood in a changing climate across regions. We reviewed the synergistic impacts of windstorms on forests and assessed research trends and methodological approaches from peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 to 2020 in tropical (TRF), subtropical (SUF), and temperate (TEF) forests/zones, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Overall, the majority of the reviewed studies were conducted in TRF (i.e., 40%), intermediate in SUF (i.e., 34%), and the lowest in TEF (i.e., 26%). Among the four levels of biological organization, the species-population and community-ecosystem levels had the highest number of study cases, while the molecular-cellular-individual and landscape levels had the lowest study cases in all forest types. Most of the articles reviewed dealt largely on tree mortality/survival and regeneration/succession for TRF, tree mortality/survival and species composition/richness/diversity for SUF, and stem density, gap dynamics, and regeneration/succession for TEF. However, research on the effects of windstorms on mycorrhizal symbioses, population genetics, and physiological adaptation, element fluxes via litterfall, litter decomposition, belowground processes, biological invasion, and tree health are less common in all forest types. Further, most of the studies were conducted in permanent plots but these studies mostly used observational design, while controlled studies are obviously limited. Consequently, more observational and controlled studies are needed on the topic reviewed, particularly studies at the molecular-cellular-individual and landscape levels, to help inform forest management decision-making about developing sustainable and resilient forests amid climate change. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

abstract = {The identity of the dominant root-associated microbial symbionts in a forest determines the ability of trees to access limiting nutrients from atmospheric or soil pools1,2, sequester carbon3,4 and withstand the effects of climate change5,6. Characterizing the global distribution of these symbioses and identifying the factors that control this distribution are thus integral to understanding the present and future functioning of forest ecosystems. Here we generate a spatially explicit global map of the symbiotic status of forests, using a database of over 1.1 million forest inventory plots that collectively contain over 28,000 tree species. Our analyses indicate that climate variables—in particular, climatically controlled variation in the rate of decomposition—are the primary drivers of the global distribution of major symbioses. We estimate that ectomycorrhizal trees, which represent only 2% of all plant species7, constitute approximately 60% of tree stems on Earth. Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis dominates forests in which seasonally cold and dry climates inhibit decomposition, and is the predominant form of symbiosis at high latitudes and elevation. By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees dominate in aseasonal, warm tropical forests, and occur with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate biomes in which seasonally warm-and-wet climates enhance decomposition. Continental transitions between forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal trees occur relatively abruptly along climate-driven decomposition gradients; these transitions are probably caused by positive feedback effects between plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic nitrogen fixers—which are insensitive to climatic controls on decomposition (compared with mycorrhizal fungi)—are most abundant in arid biomes with alkaline soils and high maximum temperatures. The climatically driven global symbiosis gradient that we document provides a spatially explicit quantitative understanding of microbial symbioses at the global scale, and demonstrates the critical role of microbial mutualisms in shaping the distribution of plant species. {\textcopyright} 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract = {We investigated the feeding preferences of six species of mites and collembolans for three fungi commonly associated with roots of Acer saccharum (Glomus macrocarpum, Alternaria alternata and Trichoderma harzianum), from a maple-forest soil in southern Ontario, Canada. Experiments were also conducted in vitro to determine animal feeding responses to (1) increasing quantities of hyphal biomass, (2) the presence of root vs. litter fungal substrates, and (3) hyphae of different widths of Glomus macrocarpum. The results indicate that arthropods prefer to graze in the litter region rather than in the deeper soil layers. Under ideal moisture/temperature conditions, animals are forced to the lower regions by interspecific interactions. They prefer to graze on hyphae of conidial fungi rather than on those of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. When arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae are grazed, there is a clear preference for the narrower hyphae, which are those further away from the root. The thicker hyphal segments, commonly found connecting 'absorptive hyphal fans' to roots, were less preferred. These data are not consistent with the hypothesis that microarthropods are detrimental to arbuscular mycorrhizal associations, and suggest that Glomalean fungi may have evolved mechanisms to deter grazing by microarthropods.},

abstract = {Rhizosphere soils receive a substantial input of plant carbon (rhizosphere C flux, RCF), and therefore support larger microbial populations and higher decomposing activity compared to bulk soils. The relative difference between rhizosphere and bulk soils (rhizosphere effect) may be sensitive to the effects of soil nutrient availability on plant belowground C allocation and RCF. However, it is not known whether rhizosphere effects are similarly responsive to availability of different nutrients, such as N or P, or to a combination of N and P. We tested the effects of elevated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), alone and in combination, on microbial activity and abundance in bulk and rhizosphere soils associated with two tree species, red maple and yellow birch, in young, possibly N-limited northern hardwood forests in a long-term fertilization study in New Hampshire, USA. We found that N addition increased microbial respiration, soluble inorganic N, and potential net N mineralization and nitrification, and decreased fungal abundance and fungal:bacterial ratios in red maple soils, but decreased microbial respiration, fungal abundance and the F:B ratio in yellow birch soils. Positive rhizosphere effects were observed for microbial respiration, potential net N mineralization, and microbial abundance for both tree species. Nitrogen addition suppressed rhizosphere effects on microbial activity and abundance in red maple soils but did not alter rhizosphere effects in yellow birch soils. Our results show strong effects of N and some interactions with P on soil processes, microbial abundance and rhizosphere effects in these forests. Nitrogen effects strongly depended on tree species, suggesting the importance of differential responses to nutrients between arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal associations, and indicating the importance of belowground processes to species-specific effects on C and mineral nutrient transformations. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The stands formed gradients of developmental stage (15-, 30-, and 50-year-old stands) in the stands of medium fertility, and of site fertility in the young stands (30-year-old fertile, medium fertile, and least fertile stands). The biomass of the external hyphae of ectomycorrhizas (ECM) was the highest, and the diversity of the fungal community the lowest, in the most fertile stand. The vertical distributions of fine roots of the three tree species were mostly overlapping, indicating high inter-specific belowground competition in the stands. We did not find any clear trends in the fine root biomass (FRB) or length across the stand developmental stages. The FRB of the conifers varied with site fertility, whereas in B. pendula it was almost constant. In contrast to the conifers, the specific root length (SRL) of B. pendula clearly increased from the most fertile to the least fertile stand. This indicates differences in the primary nutrient acquisition strategy between conifers and B. pendula. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract = {Boreal forest soils store significant amounts of carbon and are cohabited by saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM). The 'Gadgil effect' implies antagonistic interactions between saprotrophic fungi and ECM. Plant photosynthates support the competitive fitness of the ECM, and may also shape the soil bacterial communities. Many 'Gadgil effect' experiments have focused on litter layer (OL) or have litter and root-fragments present, and thus possibly favor the saprotrophs. We compared how the restriction of plant roots and exudates affect soil microbial community structures in organic soil (mixed OF and OH). For this, we established a 3-yr field experiment with 3 different mesh treatments affecting the penetration of plant roots and external fungal hyphae. Exclusion of plant photosynthates induced modest changes in both fungal and bacterial community structures, but not to potential functionality of the microbial community. The microbial community was resilient towards rather short-term disturbances. Contrary to the 'Gadgil effect', mesh treatments restricting the entrance of plant roots and external fungal hyphae did not favor saprotrophs that originally inhabited the soil. Thus, we propose that different substrate preferences (fresh litter vs. fermented or humified soil), rather than antagonism, maintain the spatial separation of saprotrophs and mycorrhizal fungi in boreal forest soils. {\textcopyright} 2019 FEMS.},

abstract = {Adaptive management is a key component of a forest project being implemented across all of Weyerhaeuser' s coastal forest tenures. This project uses two main tools to accomplish the British Columbia (BC) Coastal Group's ecological and socio-economic goals: variable retention (VR) harvesting and broad zoning of the land base. The adaptive management program was designed to examine the effectiveness of retention systems and zoning in maintaining those forest attributes necessary to sustain biological richness and essential ecosystem functions, such as nutrient transfer, energy flow, decomposition, and dispersal of seeds, spores, and animals. The program is grounded on three biological indicators evaluated in both operational and experimental contexts: 1) representation of habitat types in a relatively unmanaged state to ensure that little-known species are retained; 2) structure of stands and landscapes to ensure that key elements are present through time; and 3) indicator organisms to track whether retaining structures and patterns, while addressing representation, will maintain species and populations whose life needs are well understood. Representation of ecosystems in unmanaged conditions has been examined. Habitat structure is being assessed in VR blocks and in unmanaged blocks. Studies on several organisms (breeding birds, owls, gastropods, amphibians, bryophytes, lichen, squirrels, mycorrhizae, and carabid beetles) have been underway for various lengths of time. These studies collected baseline information to begin comparisons of the effectiveness of the various types of VR for maintaining biological richness. The current focus in the adaptive management program is refining the lists of specific elements to monitor and beginning to create tools to help extrapolate relationships and findings over large areas and long time frames, with the expectation of operational implementation in 2003. The first two years of pilot work are also being used to examine how the results will link to management practices to strengthen areas that most need improvement. This paper describes three indicators used in Weyerhaeuser's adaptive management program.},

abstract = {In different forest ecosystems, fine roots commonly proliferate into litter layers, especially into those with favorable conditions for root growth. Our aim is to provide a basis for better understanding the role and mechanism of action in litter decomposition by fine roots and the influence of litter decomposition on fine root growth. We reviewed the advances of recent studies, including how roots forage into litter, the factors influencing this foraging, and the influence and possible mechanisms of fine root growth on litter decomposition. We put forward a conceptual module that enhances understanding of the interaction between fine-root growth and litter decomposition. Litter quantity on the soil surface affects the foraging behavior of fine-roots and drives their growth dynamics. Litter quality can also affect fine-root growth. Fine-root growth enhancement or inhibition could be the result of a positive or negative balance between nutrient and polyphenols concentrations generated during the decomposition of litter with different properties. By proliferating in litter, fine roots potentially influence litter decomposition through priming effects, N uptake, and symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi. The priming effects of live fine-roots on litter decomposition are mainly manifested by root exudate C inputs, which can regulate decomposition of litter by controlling the activity and composition of the microbial community. Nitrogen availability is critically important to litter decomposition, and low N availability can increase decomposition as microbes use labile substrates to acquire N from recalcitrant organic matter. Fine-roots grow into a decomposed litter layer, which avoid the adverse effects of excess N on microorganisms by absorbing a large amount of inorganic N during litter mineralization. In addition, root symbiotic partners, i.e., mycorrhizal fungi, have an important impact on litter decomposition through the types of fungi and enzymes and organic acids secretion. Key scientific issues for future research include the mechanism of combined effect of fine root growth on litter decomposition in the context of global climate change, as well as the connection of the fine root branching structure and function of nutrient acquisition in the litter layer. {\textcopyright} 2016, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

abstract = {Young pitch pine seedlings are frequently subjected to prescribed burns in the New Jersey pine barrens as part of the management to eliminate fuel load in these forests, thereby reducing the risk of wildfire. The burns are relatively cool and release nutrients without killing the vegetation. Not all nutrients mineralized are immediately available to the plants, however. To determine factors that may contribute to nutrient release and to link this to availability of nutrients to plants following a fire in the pine barrens, a greenhouse study was conducted. The experimental design was a 3 × 2 × 2 × 3 factorial with three types of litter, high and low watering regime, burned and unburned litter, and three sample dates. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (through a rubidium analog) uptake rates were measured using natural isotope or radioisotope root bioassays. Though in the short time the experiment ran, neither an overall burned litter nor a litter quality effect was seen, high watering made P less available and K more available. N and K were the most available immediately following application of treatments, whereas P was not available until after 6 weeks following treatment application. Net mineralization of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium occurred in burned litter, whereas net immobilization of N and P occurred in highly watered, unburned litter. Since watering and timing were most influential in making nutrients available to seedlings following application of treatments in this greenhouse study, these factors may also be important in making nutrients available to mature trees in the New Jersey pine barrens. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) deposition on forests decreases the decomposition of organic matter, and may therefore decrease N mineralization. However, a higher N supply also meets the N demands of soil microbes, which may increase N mineralization, especially if the trees reduce their carbon allocation to mycorrhizal fungi and other biotic N sinks in the rhizosphere. We report effects of high continuous N load and of termination of N load on stem wood volume, foliar and soil chemistry, gross N turnover, and soil microbial communities in a boreal Norway spruce forest in Sweden. Ammonium nitrate had been applied annually for 42years at average rates of 34kgha-1year-1 of N to the N1 plots, and for two decades at 73 and 108kgha-1year-1 of N to N2 and N3 plots, respectively. Treatments N2 and N3 were terminated 19 and 17years before the study, which enabled us to study the recovery from the previous high N load.Stem growth responded strongly to N additions and correlated to gross N mineralization and microbial community composition. Total stem volume measured in 2010 was 299, 483, 470, and 376m3ha-1, in N0 (control), N1, N2, and N3 plots, respectively. In N-limited control plots with high soil C/N ratio and low soil and needle N concentrations, we observed lower gross N mineralization rate and lower recovery of non-immobilized tracer in the soil ammonium pool, which indicates a high microbial N immobilization capacity. Commonly, microbial biomarkers decline after N addition, which was also found here, whereas total abundance was highest in high N plots with thick mor-layer. Contrary to our expectation the fungi/bacteria ratio was not lower, because fungi and bacteria declined concurrently and to the same extent. As we expected, soils in N amended plots had higher relative amounts of gram-positive bacteria than in control plots. Termination of N additions caused a reduction in gross N mineralization and needle N. Lower 15N abundance in needles compared with the mor-layer indicated a recovery of the function of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis.We propose that the higher gross N mineralization rate in N-loaded forest is not caused by greater decomposition of organic matter, but a higher internal turnover of microbial N. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Glomalin is a soil proteinaceous substance produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Most of the information available concerning this protein has been collected in relation to its role in soil aggregation. In this study, we explored the distribution of glomalin across soil horizons, decomposition of glomalin, and relationship with soil C and N in an agricultural field, a native forest, and an afforested system. Glomalin was present in A, B, and C horizons in decreasing concentrations. Land-use type significantly affected glomalin concentrations (mg cm-3), with native forest soils having the highest concentrations of the three land-use types in both A and B horizons. In terms of glomalin stocks (Mg ha-1), calculated based on corrected horizon weights, the agricultural area was significantly lower than both afforested and native forest areas. As measured after a 413 day laboratory soil incubation, glomalin was least persistent in the A horizon of the afforested area.. In agricultural soils and native soils, ca. 50% of glomalin was still remaining after this incubation, indicating that some glomalin may be in the slow or recalcitrant soil C fraction. Comparison of glomalin decomposition with CO2-C respired during incubation indicates that glomalin makes a large contribution to active soil organic C pools. Soil C and N were highly correlated with glomalin across all soils and within each land-use type, indicating that glomalin may be under similar controls as soil C. Our results show that glomalin may be useful as an indicator of land-use change effects on deciduous forest soils.},

abstract = {The N cycles for a red pine Pinus resinosa plantation and a mixed hardwood stand in central Massachusetts, both of which were found to have high 'resistance' to nutrient losses following disturbance, are presented. Both stands exhibit 1) slow rates of N cycling, 2) undetectable levels of nitrate and ammonia in lysimeter samples collected below the rooting zone, 3) small to negligible enrichment of N in throughfall compared with stemflow, and 4) no immobilization of N in decomposing leaf litter. All of these indicate a slow and tight N cycle and may also be indicative of 'resistant' systems. Four major sinks for N within disturbed plots (created by trenching around a 1 X 4 m soil block) are analysed; 1) denitrification, 2) leaching losses below the rooting zone and immobilization into 3) fine roots and 4) woody roots. In the hardwood stand these account for only 37 of 104 kg N ha-1 mineralized and 66 of 90 kg N ha-1 in the pines. An additional internal sink may be a delayed immobilization potential resulting from the lack of immobilization in decomposing leaf litter. This creates soil organic matter which may be used as a substrate for further immobilization when the removal of plant uptake increases N availability in soils. Additional immobilization may result from a switch from a decomposition system dominated by symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi to one dominated by free-living microbes.-Authors},

Hook) and Mytilaria laosensis forests in subtropical China. The treatments included:(1) reciprocal litter transplant; (2) litter removal; (3) no inputs (litter removal+ root trenching); and (4) control. Each treatment had four 2 m×2 m plots. From January to December 2012, we collected the top 5 cm soil layer samples monthly from C. lanceolata and M. laosensis plots. Chloroform fumigation-extraction was used to determine the soil microbial biomass C and nitrogen (N) contents. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to characterize the microbial community composition in soil samples collected in June 2012. Results suggested that the C input manipulations induced differences in soil microbial biomass and community composition were dependent on tree species. C input manipulations had no significant effects on soil microbial biomass C and N under M. laosensis. However, the concentrations of microbial biomass C and N seemed to increase under C. lanceolata. PLFA analysis showed that M. laosensis litter significantly increased the contents of bacterial PLFAs, fungal PLFAs and actinomycetes, and significantly enhanced the percent abundance of gram-negative bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi under C. lanceolata. Litter removal significantly increased the contents of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, actinomycetes and fungi by 22%, 29%, 44%, 25% and 52%, respectively, and also increased the fungi to bacteria ratio by 21% compared with the control in C. lanceolata soil. However, litter removal and root trenching did not change soil microbial community composition in C. lanceolata and M. laosensis soils. Seasonal patterns of microbial biomass C and N were different between C. lanceolata and M. laosensis plantations. Nutrient availability rather than soil temperature, moisture or fresh litter input, may determine seasonal fluctuation of soil microbial biomass in this study. Our results suggested that further studies are required to confirm the relative contribution of above- and belowground C inputs in different tree species plantations in subtropical China. {\textcopyright} 2016, Ecological Society of China.

@article{Lamont1982597,
abstract = {The major constraints to nutrient uptake by vascular plants in mediterranean South Africa and Western Australia are: very infertile soils, relatively low temperatures when water availability is high, and hot, dry summers. These constraints are partly overcome through increased efficiency of uptake, tapping novel sources of nutrients, and prolonging water uptake. Absorptive area per unit "cost" may be enlarged directly through increased fineness of the root system and proliferation of long root hairs. This reaches its greatest development in the root clusters of the Proteaceae (proteoid roots), Restionaceae ("capillaroid" roots) and Cyperaceae (dauciform roots). Absorptive area is increased indirectly through fungal hyphae which extend from hairless rootlets into the soil. Two major groups can be recognised: general (VA mycorrhizas) and host-specific (ericoid, orchid and sheathing mycorrhizas). Mycorrhizas are the most widespread specialised modes of nutrition and are probably universal in such major taxa here as Podocarpus, Acacia, Fabaceae, Poaceae, Asteraceae, Rutaceae, terrestrial orchids, Ericales and Myrtaceae. General mycorrhizas are the least drought-adapted of mechanisms for maximising absorptive area. All have been implicated in enhancing P uptake through increasing access to inorganic P, solubilisation and shortening the diffusion path. However, selective uptake of other nutrients, especially N, by host-specific mycorrhizas may be equally important. Included under novel sources of nutrients are free N2 (utilised by N2-fixing nodules), small-animal prey (carnivorous leaves) and persistent leaf bases (aerial roots of Kingia australis). Both legume and non-legume N2-fixing species are well-represented in these two regions, with stands of individual species in southwestern Australia estimated to contribute 2-19 kg N/ha/yr to the ecosystem. Free nitrogen fixation requires additional nutrients, especially Mo and Co, but is enhanced following fires and by supplementary uptake mechanisms, especially VA mycorrhizas. Southwestern Australia is particularly rich in carnivorous species. Nitrogen, P, K and S are important nutrients absorbed, with digestion aided by enzymes provided by bacteria and the glands. Parasitic plants both tap novel sources of nutrients and capitalise on any efficient water and nutrient uptake mechanisms of the hosts. Root parasites are better represented than stem parasites in mediterranean South Africa and Western Australia. Phosphorus and K in particular are absorbed preferentially by the haustoria, but much remains to be known about their modes of operation. Maximum activity of all uptake mechanisms, except those attached to some deep-rooted plants, is restricted to winter-spring. Most new seasons's rootlets and specialised roots are confined to the uppermost 15 cm of soil, especially in or near the decomposing litter zone. Nutrient uptake is further enhanced by the tendency for the rootlets to cluster, trapping water by capillary action and prolonging nutrient release. As an early product of decomposition, N tends to be available as NH4 (rather than NO3) and it is absorbed preferentially by almost all specialised modes of nutrition. Microorganisms are required in the formation and/or functioning of all these structures, except haustoria. Uptake mechanisms which are optional to the plant reach their peak contribution to the root system at soil nutrient levels well below those required for greatest plant growth, when they may be absent altogether. It is only over the narrow range of nutrient availability, where shoot content of a nutrient is greater in the presence of the mechanism than in its absence (other factors remaining constant), that specialised modes can be termed nutrient-uptake "strategies." For all specialised modes of nutrition, the component genera are better represented in these two regions than in the surrounding more fertile, arid to subtropical regions of much greater area. Endemism of species with each mode exceeds that for the two floras overall (75%). This is taken as preliminary evidence that specialised modes of nutrition are best represented in nutrient-poor soils. While they serve to limit nutrient loss from the ecosystem, their proliferation is therefore not necessarily a response to increasing "leaks" in the system. A hierarchical scheme of the functional/structural relationships between the various mechanisms is presented, starting with the rootless, VA-mycorrhizal plant as the most primitive condition. Taxa with many of the specialised modes of nutrition at present in southwestern South Africa and Western Australia have been evident in the pollen record since the early Tertiary Period. The absence of ectomycorrhizal forests in mediterranean South Africa, in marked contrast to Western Australia, can be traced to differences in their paleohistory. In both regions, the combination of fluctuating, but essentially diminishing, nutrient and water availability that began with the first mediterranean climate < 5 million years ago resulted in decimation of the less-tolerant rainforest ancestors on the one hand, and remarkable rates of speciation of the pre-adapted sclerophyll nucleus on the other. {\textcopyright} 1982 The New York Botanical Garden.},

abstract = {Northern peatlands are important carbon (C) sinks and while the patterns of C accumulation have been frequently investigated, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) accumulation are often neglected. Here we link the C:N:P stoichiometry from foliar plant tissues, through senescent litters to peat, and determine C, N and P accumulation rates at Mer Bleue Bog, eastern Canada. Average C:N:P ratios changed from 794:17:1 in the foliar tissues to 911:10:1 in litter and 1285:32:1 in acrotelm peat. The increase in C:N and C:P ratios from mature to senescent tissues is related to nutrient resorption. The increase in C:P and N:P ratios in peat, which was contrary to that observed in Canadian forest soils, may be related to plant/mycorrhizae uptake of P. The long-term apparent rates of C, N and P accumulation were 29.5 ± 2.1 (SE) g C, 0.87 ± 0.01 g N and 0.017 ± 0.002 g P m-2 yr-1, respectively. The significant correlation between the accumulation rates of N and P and that of C suggests more attention be placed on C:N:P stoichiometry in peatland biogeochemistry, in particular in understanding why C:P ratios are so large in the lower parts of the profile. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {A 2-yr study evaluated the effects of acid precipitation on the forest floor community. Throughfall was collected at weekly intervals, acidified to pH 4.3 and 3.6, and applied to throughfall excluded 1 m2 plots in a stand of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) in south Mississippi, and in a longleaf pine (P. palustris Mill.) plantation in east Texas. Control plots received ambient throughfall which ranged from pH 3.7 to 6.2 in Mississippi and pH 3.8 to 6.7 in Texas. Five plots of each treatment at each location were destructively sampled after 1 yr and the 5 remaining plots were sampled after 2 yr. Chemical analyses were conducted for all collections of throughfall and litter leachate, and for the fermentation layer, rhizosphere, and mineral soil. After 2 yr, comparisons of the pH 3.6 plots with the controls indicated significant decreases in the number, length and biomass of lateral roots, and the percent and number of ectomycorrhizae. Decreases in these root characteristics for plots subjected to applications of throughfall acidified to near-ambient pH 4.3 were also significant or bordered on significance. Numbers of herbivorous mites increased significantly with decreasing pH, but the predaceous mites appeared insensitive. Treated plots had fewer numbers of some groups of the larger invertebrates, especially earthworms, but variation was generally too great to show significance. The acid treatments had little effect on numbers of nematodes, saprophytic fungi or endomycorrhizal fungi. {\textcopyright} 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {The frequent co-occurrence of ectomycorrhizas and arbuscular mycorrhizas in the same ecosystem raises the question about how two functionally different mycorrhizal associations exploit a spatially heterogeneous habitat. Horizontal (in plots along a transect of 3750 m crossing forest types of low and high abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) host species) and vertical (across profiles of litter and 0-5 cm, 10-15 cm, 25-35 cm soil layers) distribution of ectomycorrhizas and arbuscular mycorrhizas in relation to edaphic parameters (pH, moisture, total carbon, total nitrogen and extractable-phosphorus concentration) was compared in Korup National Park rain forest, to test the hypothesis that the two types of mycorrhiza exploit different niches. No pattern was observed in either ECM or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fractional colonization with depth in the profile even though most of the variation in soil parameters was vertical. Only local (between monoliths within plots) horizontal differences were found in soil parameters. By contrast, horizontal differences in fractional colonization were found between forest types, and between monoliths, for ectomycorrhizas but only between monoliths for arbuscular mycorrhizas. The lack of a clear relationship between both horizontal and vertical distribution of ECM and AM fractional colonization and soil parameters suggests that both fungal groups are equally able to colonize the same niche, at the scale of our experiment. By contrast, a negative relationship was found between AM and ECM fractional colonization in the litter and 0-5 cm and 10-15 cm soil layers. This, in addition to the more heterogeneous horizontal distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizas in forest areas dominated by ectomycorrhizas and a patchy vertical distribution of the former as opposed to a more coherent distribution of the latter, suggests that both types of mycorrhizal fungi compete for the same niche. The co-occurrence of ectomycorrhizas and arbuscular mycorrhizas might be explained by differences between ECM and AM hosts and fungi in their colonizing abilities.},

The highest 137Cs concentrations in the soil profiles were observed mostly in the surface soil layer (0-5 cm). Litter layers contained significantly less 137Cs than the surface soil layer. Concentrations of 137Cs in plants were in general much lower than those in mushrooms. The levels of 137Cs in 81 mushroom species collected in 1989 and 1990 varied very widely, ranging from <4 to 16300 Bq/kg (dry wt.), while those of 40K were relatively constant. The median concentrations of 137Cs and 40K were 45 and 1110 Bq/kg (dry wt.), respectively. The 137Cs concentrations in mycorrhizal fungi tended to be higher than those in saprophytes, although the concentration range of each type varied widely. High concentrations of 137Cs in several Hebeloma species, ammonia fungi, were observed.

abstract = {Heterotrophic soil microorganisms rely on carbon (C) allocated belowground in plant production, but belowground C allocation (BCA) by plants is a poorly quantified part of ecosystem C cycling, especially, in peat soil. We applied a C balance approach to quantify BCA in a mixed conifer-red maple (Acer rubrum) forest on deep peat soil. Direct measurements of CH4 and CO2 fluxes across the soil surface (soil respiration), production of fine and small plant roots, and aboveground litterfall were used to estimate respiration by roots, by mycorrhizae and by free-living soil microorganisms. Measurements occurred in two consecutive years. Soil respiration rates averaged 1.2 $\mu$mol m-2 s-1 for CO2 and 0.58 nmol m-2 s-1 for CH4 (371 to 403 g C m -2 year-1). Carbon in aboveground litter (144 g C m-2 year-1) was 84% greater than C in root production (78 g C m-2 year-1). Complementary in vitro assays located high rates of anaerobic microbial activity, including methanogenesis, in a dense layer of roots overlying the peat soil and in large-sized fragments within the peat matrix. Large-sized fragments were decomposing roots and aboveground leaf and twig litter, indicating that relatively fresh plant production supported most of the anaerobic microbial activity. Respiration by free-living soil microorganisms in deep peat accounted for, at most, 29 to 38 g C m -2 year-1. These data emphasize the close coupling between plant production, ecosystem-level C cycling and soil microbial ecology, which BCA can help reveal. {\textcopyright} Taylor and Francis Inc.},

ECM fungi were dominant in forests of both types in Ishikawa and a Larix kaempheri forest in Tomakomai (Hokkaido), whereas WDC fungi were dominant in a deciduous broad-leaved forest in Sapporo (Hokkaido). ECM and WDC fungi usually showed two abundance peaks in Kanazawa (Ishikawa), mid-summer and autumn for ECM fungi and spring or summer and autumn for WDC fungi, whereas LDC fungi usually showed one peak in autumn. In Tomakomai, the abundance peak appeared later in ECM fungi but earlier in LDC and WDC fungi in comparison with Kanazawa. The mode of resource acquisition is assumed as one of factors that affect the seasonal timing of fruiting-body production. On the other hand, highly positive correlations were often observed between precipitation in Jun or Aug and the fruiting-body production in summer and/or autumn in the survey in Kanazawa, suggesting that precipitation could affect the fruiting-body production a few months later. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Mycological Society of Japan},

The aim of this study was to compare the physical and chemical properties of soils under GDF with those under an adjacent mixed forest (AMF), while controlling for topography. To this end, we set up sixteen 0.25-ha plots according to forest type and topography (plateau vs. bottomland), in the Yoko forest reserve, Democratic Republic of Congo. In each plot, we measured litter thickness and collected a total of 80 soil samples at depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 120-150 cm, for standard physical and chemical analyses. When controlling for topography and soil texture, we found that most of the chemical properties of soils under GDF did not differ from those of soils under AMF, particularly acidity, cation concentration, total N and the C:N ratio. The litter layer was 2.3 times thicker under GDF than under AMF stands, and, for a given texture, soils under GDF had a slightly higher organic C concentration in the 0-5 cm soil layer. This study suggests that G. dewevrei stands modify organic matter dynamics, which may be important in maintaining its monodominance. {\textcopyright} Copyright Cambridge University Press 2018.},

abstract = {Host-plants may rarely leave their ancestral niche and in which case they tend to be surrounded by phylogenetically distant neighbours. Phylogenetically isolated host-plants might share few mutualists with their neighbours and might suffer from a decrease in mutualist support. In addition host plants leaving their ancestral niche might face a deterioration of their abiotic and biotic environment and might hence need to invest more into mutualist partners. We tested whether phylogenetic isolation of hosts from neighbours decreases or increases abundance and activity of their mutualists and whether mutualist activity may help to compensate deterioration of the environment. We study oak-hosts and their ectomycorrhizal fungi mutualists established in the litter layer formed by the phylogenetically closely or distantly related neighbourhood. We find that oaks surrounded by phylogenetically distant neighbours show increased abundance and enzymatic activity of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the litter. Moreover, oaks surrounded by phylogenetically distant neighbours also show delayed budburst but ectomycorrhizal fungi activity partly compensates this negative effect of phylogenetic isolation. This suggests decreased nutrient availability in a phylogenetically distant litter partly compensated by increased litter-degradation by ectomycorrhizal fungi activity. Most observed effects of phylogenetic isolation cannot be explained by a change in baseline soil fertility (as reflected by nutritional status of fresh oak litter, or soil microbial biomass and activity) nor by simple reduction of percentages of oak neighbours, nor by the presence of gymnosperms. Our results show that colonizing new niche represented by the presence of distantly related neighbours may delay plant phenology but may be supported by mycorrhizal mutualists. Studies on other host-plant species are required to generalize our findings. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Belowground carbon allocation and soil respiration should thus reflect plant effort allocated to nutrient uptake, for example in conditions of different nutrient availabilities controlled by site quality or stand history. Soil respiration, belowground C allocation, and fine root biomass were measured in three sites differing in nutrient availability in the northern hardwood forests of the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Annual soil respiration and belowground C allocation measured in two stands at each site were lowest at Jeffers Brook, the site with highest nutrient availability, and higher at Hubbard Brook and Bartlett Experimental Forests. Neither soil respiration nor belowground C allocation differed significantly between mid-aged (31–41 year old) and older stands (>80 year old) within the sites, despite higher fine root (<1 mm) biomass in old stands than mid-aged stands. During the growing season, soil respiration was low where net nitrogen mineralization and net nitrification were high across an extensive sample of thirteen stands and annual belowground C allocation decreased with increasing nitrification across the six intensively studied stands. Available P was not related to soil respiration. The relationships among N availability, belowground C allocation, and soil respiration support the claim that forests allocate more C belowground in ecosystems with low availability of a limiting nutrient. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal association is ubiquitous and can be found in majority of natural habitats. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play a key role in the absorption of plant nutrients, soil aggregation and fertility. The basic role of AMF in the plant growth is to increase the absorption and translocation of relatively immobile ions and elements. In the past, studies have focused primarily on the mycorrhiza development and their general role in the growth of plants. Here, in this review manuscript, we highlight the role of AMF in the growth of old forests. In many studies, it has been found that concentration of phosphorous (P) decreases with the stand age which as a result leads to phosphorous (P) deficiency. This phosphorous (P) deficiency is considered as a cause of slow growth of old forests. In this review article, we argued that apart from the low concentration of phosphorous (P), weak arbuscular mycorrhizal associations are also a cause of slow growth of old forests. Furthermore, we also highlight the ecological role of AMF in the soil carbon storage. AMF provide physical (hyphae frame) and chemical support (Glomalin) to the dispersed soil particles to create stable aggregated soil structure. The Glomalin compound which is released by AMF acts like a glue and consequently increases soil aggregation. The soil organic matters stored in soil aggregates are less exposed to decomposition. Hence, soil can be used as a large sink where a huge amount of carbon can be stored in the form of soil organic matters which as a result can contribute to the mitigation of global climate change. {\textcopyright} 2019, AL{\"{O}}KI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.},

Linking these ecological roles to specific fungi is necessary to improve our understanding of global nutrient cycling, fungal ecophysiology, and forest ecology. Using discriminant analyses of nitrogen ($\delta$15N) and carbon ($\delta$13C) isotope values from 813 fungi across 23 sites, we verified collector-based categorizations as either ectomycorrhizal (ECM) or SAP in > 91% of the fungi, and provided probabilistic assignments for an additional 27 fungi of unknown ecological role. As sites ranged from boreal tundra to tropical rainforest, we were able to show that fungal $\delta$13C (26 sites) and $\delta$15N (32 sites) values could be predicted by climate or latitude as previously shown in plant and soil analyses. Fungal $\delta$13C values are likely reflecting differences in C-source between ECM and SAP fungi, whereas 15N enrichment of ECM fungi relative to SAP fungi suggests that ECM fungi are consistently delivering 15N depleted N to host trees across a range of ecosystem types. {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {A major gap in understanding the relationship between tree diversity and litter decomposition concerns knowledge of the saprotrophic fungal communities mediating decomposition processes. Making use of experimental tree diversity plots in subtropical China, our objective was to disentangle the effects of tree species richness on diversity, abundance, and composition of saprotrophic fungal communities in freshly fallen leaf litter. We employed a meta-genomic approach and analysed enzymatic decomposition. Our results indicate the dominance of Ascomycota, with species from this phylum colonizing leaf litter more rapidly than Basidiomycota. Furthermore, Ascomycota was the most abundant when tree richness was intermediate. Both Ascomycota and Basidiomycota differed significantly in their species composition in response to varying tree species richness. However, saprotrophic fungal species diversity did not respond to tree species richness. Instead, litter C/N ratio, litter Ca and plot altitude were the strongest determinants of fungal species diversity. Carbon-degradation enzyme activities were also significantly associated with litter C/N ratio, Ca and Fe concentration and, in addition, with tree species richness. The responses of fungal species and enzyme activity to tree species richness were uncoupled from each other, although the two variables were significantly correlated. Overall, our findings highlight a significant effect of tree species richness on litter fungal species composition, but not diversity. Our findings also provide insight into the importance of enzyme-mediated C degradation for the response to tree species richness in early-stage leaf decay in subtropical forests. {\textcopyright} 2018},

abstract = {Cutting dry deciduous forest (preserved site) for wood supply in semi-arid Brazil has led to invasion of a pioneer shrub vegetation called “Carrasco” (disturbed site), which inhibits the sprouting of native species. A land restoration project was undertaken in a cleared Carrasco area where a mixed plantation of native species and Eucalyptus spp. (experimental site) was established to preserve the forest and ensure wood supply for the local population. We considered phosphorus as a limiting soil nutrient to plant growth, and we addressed the roles of litter decomposition and microbial activity on phosphorus release in the disturbed, preserved and experimental sites. The phosphorus released from leaf litter was affected by the vegetation type, which favored specific soil microbial populations during decomposition. The Carrasco vegetation predominantly favored arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), as shown by root colonization in the litter bags; the Eucalyptus plants favored AMF and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EM), as well as phosphate solubilizing microorganisms (PSM), and the intercropping system favored AMF and PSM groups. In contrast, the preserved site favored the PSM population. High phosphatase activity was found in the preserved and experimental sites in contrast to the Carrasco soil. Principal component analysis showed that AMF root colonization and phosphatase activity were the main parameters influencing the increase in soil phosphorus. Based on the above results, rehabilitation appeared to be underway in the experimental site, since the samples were more similar to the preserved site than to the disturbed site. This effect was attributed to Eucalyptus camaldulensis that promote the establishment of all phosphorus cycle-related microorganisms (AMF, EM and PSF). E. camaldulensis associated with mycorrhizal fungi and PSM are recommended for inclusion in agroforestry systems. {\textcopyright} SISEF.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic fires have varying effects on the oak-dominated forests of the Zagros Mountains in western Iran. The objective of this project was to investigate the effects of fire on various components of soil. For this purpose three homogeneous and neighboring sites were inspected. Site A was the unburned control. Sites B and C experienced fires about 2 and 8 years prior to the study, respectively. In comparison to the control, site B showed a decline in organic matter content (1.69 ± 0.24 vs. 1.13 ± 0.17), N amount (0.40 ± 0.05 vs. 0.19 ± 0.03), litter depth (1.20 ± 0.214 cm vs. 0.087 ± 0.044 cm), germinated seedlings (272 ± 40 vs. 75 ± 25), earthworm biomass (3.4 g/kg vs. 0.26 g/kg), and plant diversity (1.95 ± 0.30 vs. 1.35 ± 0.34). An increase was observed for pH (7.41 ± 0.11 vs. 7.72 ± 0.15), Ca (569.09 ± 34 vs. 855 ± 38.17), bulk density (1.17 ± 0.05 vs. 1.66 ± 0.18), the number of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) spores, and stump sprouting (1645 ± 533 and 3425 ± 491). Site C showed a similar decrease in organic matter content, N amount, litter depth, germinated seedlings, and earthworm biomass. However, plant diversity was greatly increased at site C, demonstrating that the conditions were better for plant life 8 years after the fire event. Thus, the number of germinated seedlings was lower than that of the control, while stump sprouting (4170 ± 452 per ha) was the greatest. The AM spore count was higher at site B in comparison to site C, indicating that fire had caused a long-term loss in this essential component of the soil. An increase in pH was a characteristic feature of the burnt sites. Levels of macronutrient K were greatly increased at site C. In fact, K content was much higher than the other two sites (A, B, and C: 51.81 ± 3.69, 59.75 ± 8.18, and 72.55 ± 20.66, respectively), indicating that increased K content is a long-term effect of fire. Bulk density (1.80 ± 0.14) increased at site C, which may be due to the insufficient earthworm biomass. Thus, 8 years were not enough to improve the soil conditions for soil fauna. {\textcopyright} T{\"{U}}BİTAK.},

abstract = {Fungi are an important and diverse component of soil communities, but
these communities have proven difficult to study in conventional biotic
surveys. We evaluated soil fungal diversity at two sites in a temperate
forest using direct isolation of small-subunit and internal transcribed
spacer (ITS) rRNA genes by PCR and high-throughput sequencing of cloned
fragments. We identified 412 sequence types from 863 fungal ITS
sequences, as well as 112 ITS sequences from other eukaryotic
microorganisms. Equal proportions of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota
sequences were present in both the ITS and small-subunit libraries,
while members of other fungal phyla were recovered at much lower
frequencies. Many sequences closely matched sequences from mycorrhizal,
plant-pathogenic, and saprophytic fungi. Compositional differences were
observed among samples from different soil depths, with mycorrhizal
species predominating deeper in the soil profile and saprophytic species
predominating in the litter layer. Richness was consistently lowest in
the deepest soil horizon samples. Comparable levels of fungal richness
have been observed following traditional specimen-based collecting and
culturing surveys, but only after much more extensive sampling. The high
rate at which new sequence types were recovered even after sampling 863
fungal ITS sequences and the dominance of fungi in our libraries
relative to other eukaryotes suggest that the abundance and diversity of
fungi in forest soils may be much higher than previously hypothesized.},

abstract = {Relationships between mycorrhizal plants and soil nitrogen (N) have led to the speculation that the chemistry of plant litter and the saprotrophy of mycorrhizal symbionts can function together to closely couple the N cycle between plants and soils. We hypothesized that a tannin-rich, ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) plant promotes the retention of protein-tannin N in soil, and that this N source is accessible to saprotrophic ERM symbionts and their hosts, but remains less available to co-occurring ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbionts and their hosts. 2. We tested this feedback hypothesis in a southern Appalachian forest community composed of two microsites: a hardwood microsite with ECM and AM trees in the overstorey and understorey, and an AM herb layer; and a rhododendron microsite where the understorey and herb layer are replaced by ERM rhododendron. We synthesized 15N-enriched protein-tannin complexes from leaf litter extracts representing each forest microsite and examined the fate of 15N in soil volumes 3 months and 1 year after the complexes were placed in the field. 3. Protein-tannin complexes derived from the rhododendron microsite led to a higher retention of 15N in soil organic matter and a lower recovery in dissolved N pools than those from the hardwood microsite, supporting the hypothesis that rhododendron tannins create stable complexes that increase organic N retention in soils. 4. Rhododendron complexes led to greater 15N-enrichment in ERM roots than in AM and ECM roots, supporting the hypothesis that rhododendron can better access the N complexed by its own litter tannins than can co-occurring forest trees and plants. Our results suggest that both fungal saprotrophy and a high specific root length contribute to the ability of ERM roots to acquire N from complex organic sources. 5. Synthesis. This study provides evidence of an intricate N feedback where plant litter chemistry influences the cycle of N to maximize N acquisition by the host's mycorrhizal roots, while hindering N acquisition by mycorrhizal roots of co-occurring plants. Feedback processes such as these have the potential to drive patterns in nitrogen cycling and productivity in many terrestrial ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2009 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Forest degradation is widespread in developing countries, as poor people depend on forest biomass collection on a “day-to-day” basis, giving little respite to forest ecosystems to recover. In the Himalayas, collection of firewood, tree leaf fodder, and leaf litter from forest floor is one of the main causes of forest degradation, particularly in oak (Quercus leucotrichophora) and pine (Pinus roxburghii) elevation belt (1000-2200 m elevation) of the Western and Central Himalayas. In this area, whole tree cutting is uncommon, but most trees are lopped until they become severely denuded, with little crown left. Compared to healthy forests, generally such degraded forests have 40-50% less biomass but about 80% less net primary productivity and 86.4% less leaf area. As degradation progresses, the biomass extracted from the forest declines, but in proportional terms it increases, resulting in a rapid disintegration of ecosystem structure and functions. Some of the observed effects are (1) reduction of soil carbon and nitrogen by 40-50%; (2) desiccation of oak acorns lying on forest floor well before the arrival of monsoon; (3) about 40% reduction in leaf litter decomposition; (4) 35% reduction in ectomycorrhizal association with roots, as indicated by fungal sporocarp density; and (5) 25% reduction in soil water holding capacity and 25% increase in soil bulk density (these values are in comparison to a relatively undisturbed forest). Recovery of a degraded forest (chronic disturbance) has not yet been investigatedbut is likely to be slower than that of a clear-cut (acute disturbance) forest. However, some interventions can result in a faster recovery. {\textcopyright} Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract = {Many forest soils are potassium (K) deficient, and Suillus species are common fungi in boreal pine forests that form ectomycorrhizal associations with trees. To select the ideal ectomycorrhizal fungi for improving the growth and K nutrition of trees in natural and artificial forests, the growth, oxalate efflux, K absorption and soil K depletion by 13 Suillus isolates were compared in pure liquid culture using soil as the sole K source. The growth of mycorrhizal Pinus massoniana Lamb. seedlings and the K extraction through extramatrical mycelia extending from the root surfaces were studied. The results showed that the tested Suillus species varied in growth rate and in the extraction of unavailable K from the soil. Their oxalate efflux may lead to the decomposition of K-bearing minerals and K release. The plants grown with added mycorrhizal fungi had higher biomass and extracted more K, particularly mineral structural K (HF-HClO4 digestible K), from the soil through the extramatrical mycelia than the seedlings grown without added mycorrhizal fungi. There was a positive correlation in K uptake between fungi grown in vitro and plants grown with mycorrhizae (R2 = 0.717, n = 8, p <.01). Therefore, in vivo tests on ectomycorrhizal fungal isolates can be used as a proxy to study the patterns and mechanisms of K extraction from the soil by extramatrical mycelia. Fungal K uptake in vitro could be one of the important indexes in the selection of Suillus for improving the growth and K nutrition of P. massoniana trees. Highlights: Suillus isolates varied in their ability to extract unavailable K from soil. Oxalate was vital to the degradation of K minerals in soil by Suillus isolates. Pine seedlings with added mycorrhizal fungi from genus Suillus had larger biomass and K uptake than their non-mycorrhizal counterparts. Suillus isolates showed similar patterns in K uptake in vitro and when forming mycorrhiza. {\textcopyright} 2019 British Society of Soil Science},

abstract = {Fungi are important members of soil microbial communities with a crucial role in biogeochemical processes. Although soil fungi are known to be highly diverse, little is known about factors influencing variations in their diversity and community structure among forests dominated by the same tree species but spread over different regions and under different managements. We analyzed the soil fungal diversity and community composition of managed and unmanaged European beech dominated forests located in three German regions, the Schw{\"{a}}bische Alb in Southwestern, the Hainich-D{\"{u}}n in Central and the Schorfheide Chorin in the Northeastern Germany, using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA pyrotag sequencing. Multiple sequence quality filtering followed by sequence data normalization revealed 1655 fungal operational taxonomic units. Further analysis based on 722 abundant fungal OTUs revealed the phylum Basidiomycota to be dominant (54%) and its community to comprise 71.4% of ectomycorrhizal taxa. Fungal community structure differed significantly (p≤0.001) among the three regions and was characterized by non-random fungal OTUs co-occurrence. Soil parameters, herbaceous understory vegetation, and litter cover affected fungal community structure. However, within each study region we found no difference in fungal community structure between management types. Our results also showed region specific significant correlation patterns between the dominant ectomycorrhizal fungal genera. This suggests that soil fungal communities are region-specific but nevertheless composed of functionally diverse and complementary taxa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wubet et al.},

abstract = {Fungal peroxidases (ClassII) have a key role in degrading recalcitrant polyphenolic compounds in boreal forest wood, litter and humus. To date, their occurrence and activity have mainly been studied in a small number of white-rot wood decomposers. However, peroxidase activity is commonly measured in boreal forest humus and mineral soils, in which ectomycorrhizal fungi predominate. Here, we used degenerate PCR primers to investigate whether peroxidase-encoding genes are present in the genomes of a wide phylogenetic range of ectomycorrhizal taxa. Cloning and sequencing of PCR products showed that ectomycorrhizal fungi from several different genera possess peroxidase genes. The new sequences represent four major homobasidiomycete lineages, but the majority is derived from Cortinarius, Russula and Lactarius. These genera are ecologically important, but consist mainly of non-culturable species from which little ecophysiological information is available. The amplified sequences contain conserved active sites, both for folding and substrate oxidation. In some Cortinarius spp., there is evidence for gene duplications during the evolution of the genus. ClassII peroxidases seem to be an ancient and a common feature of most homobasidiomycetes, including ectomycorrhizal fungi. Production of extracellular peroxidases may provide ectomycorrhizal fungi with access to nitrogen sequestered in complex polyphenolic sources. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

Among ectomycorrhizal macromycetes not a single species showed a significant increase, but at least 55 out of 126 species showed a significant decrease, a decline strongest among species exclusively or mainly associated with coniferous trees.

We investigated the effect of eleven years of N and S addition on the diversity of root-associated fungal pathogens and mutualists, including ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), dark septate endophytes (DSEs), and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi (ERM), in a broadleaf tree-dominated boreal forest using HiSeq sequencing of ITS2 amplicons of root fungal DNA. Long-term N and S addition increased the diversity of root-associated pathogens, notably the abundance of Venturia macularis, which causes aspen leaf and shoot blight, in the forest floor. Nitrogen addition increased the abundance of several N-sensitive EMF taxa and of EMF related to organic-N uptake from the soil, but had little effect on the overall abundance and diversity of EMF. Nitrogen and S addition did not affect the abundance and diversity of DSEs, but N addition decreased the Shannon diversity and evenness of ERM communities in the mineral soil. The changed diversity of root-associated fungal pathogens and mutualists suggests that long-term N and S addition will impact the host plant's capacity for nutrient acquisition and defense against pathogens in the broadleaf-dominated boreal forest. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Soils in boreal forests contain large stocks of carbon. Plants are the main source of this carbon through tissue residues and root exudates. A major part of the exudates are allocated to symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi. In return, the plant receives nutrients, in particular nitrogen from the mycorrhizal fungi. To capture the nitrogen, the fungi must at least partly disrupt the recalcitrant organic matter-protein complexes within which the nitrogen is embedded. This disruption process is poorly characterized. We used spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome profiling to examine the mechanism by which the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus degrades organic matter when acquiring nitrogen from plant litter. The fungus partially degraded polysaccharides and modified the structure of polyphenols. The observed chemical changes were consistent with a hydroxyl radical attack, involving Fenton chemistry similar to that of brown-rot fungi. The set of enzymes expressed by Pa.involutus during the degradation of the organic matter was similar to the set of enzymes involved in the oxidative degradation of wood by brown-rot fungi. However, Pa.involutus lacked transcripts encoding extracellular enzymes needed for metabolizing the released carbon. The saprotrophic activity has been reduced to a radical-based biodegradation system that can efficiently disrupt the organic matter-protein complexes and thereby mobilize the entrapped nutrients. We suggest that the released carbon then becomes available for further degradation and assimilation by commensal microbes, and that these activities have been lost in ectomycorrhizal fungi as an adaptation to symbiotic growth on host photosynthate. The interdependence of ectomycorrhizal symbionts and saprophytic microbes would provide a key link in the turnover of nutrients and carbon in forest ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Because of their prominent role in global bioproductivity and because of their complex structure and function, forests and tree species deserve particular attention in studies on the likely impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 on terrestrial vegetation. Besides a synoptic review of some of the most prominent above-ground response processes, particular attention is given to below-ground responses of trees to elevated atmospheric CO2, while some feedback processes and interactions with various biotic and abiotic factors are also briefly summarized. At the leaf level there is little evidence of the long-term loss of sensitivity to CO2 that was suggested by earlier experiments with tree seedlings in pots. Future studies on photosynthesis measurements will probably not alter our conclusions about acclimation, but should focus more on respiration under elevated CO2, which is still poorly understood. At the tree level, the increase in growth observed in elevated CO2 results from an increase in both leaf area and leaf photosynthetic rate (per unit leaf area). Tree growth enhancement is generally larger at high rates of nutrient supply; when nutrient supply rates do not meet growth rates, tree nutrient status declines and nutrients become limiting. In many studies at the canopy level, a shift in whole-tree carbon allocation pattern towards below-ground parts has been associated with increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. At the ecosystem level, a larger amount of carbon being allocated below-ground could show up by either (1) more root growth and turnover, (2) enhanced activity of root-associated microorganisms, (3) larger microbial biomass pools and enhanced microbial activity, or (4) increased losses of soil carbon through soil respiration. Fine root production is generally enhanced, but it is not clear whether this response would persist in a forest. As elevated CO2 stimulates biomass production, litterfall and rhizode-position also increase. This increased delivery of labile organic matter to the soil could influence soil microbial communities and subsequent decomposition rates, nutrient availability and carbon storage in soil. There are, however, contradictory hypothesis about the direction in which nutrient availability will be affected. Knowledge of the response of these and other ecophysiological processes to elevated CO2 is the key to understanding the functioning of the whole forest ecosystem. Our current knowledge is sufficiently large with regard to how the carbon uptake process and individual tree growth respond under atmospheric changes, but more emphasis should be put in future experiments on the interactions between various processes, such as the carbon and nitrogen cycles, and on below-ground responses.},

photosynthate to acquire below-ground resources under elevated
atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) but decrease below-ground C
allocation when nitrogen (N) is sufficient for plant growth. Arbuscular
mycorrhizae (AM) represent a critical mechanism of below-ground nutrient
acquisition for plants. The dynamics of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
(AMF) could therefore reflect the response of plant C allocation under
eCO(2) and N addition. We examined the responses of glomalin-related

decrease under N addition. Furthermore, the positive effects of eCO(2)
on GRSP would be offset by extra N addition, and GRSP would remain
unchanged under combined eCO(2) and N addition. Our results showed that

respectively, which accounted for 2.76 +/- 0.53% and 5.67 +/- 0.92% of
soil organic carbon (SOC) in the 0-10 cm soil layer. Elevated CO2
significantly increased T-GRSP by 35.02% but decreased EE-GRSP by
5.09% in the top 10 cm soil layer. The opposite responses of T-GRSP and
EE-GRSP to eCO(2) might result from an unchanged photosynthate
investment to AMF with possible changes in their decomposition rates.
The effect of N on GRSP was contrary to our hypothesis, i.e., there was
a 1.72%-48.49% increase in T-GRSP and a slightly increase in EE-GRSP.
Both EE-GRSP and T-GRSP concentrations increased under the combination
of eCO(2) and N addition, which was inconsistent with our hypothesis.
The significant increase of EE-GRSP under the combination of eCO(2) and
N addition was partly caused by more rapid plant growth and reduced
microbial diversity, and the marginal increase of T-GRSP indicated that
the interaction between eCO(2) and N addition offset their independent
effects. In addition, the relatively higher accumulation ratios of GRSP
(22.6 +/- 13.6%) compared with SOC (15.9 +/- 9.4%) indicated that more
rapid GRSP deposition in the soil might accelerate SOC accumulation
under eCO(2) and N addition. Our results will improve the understanding
of the functioning of GRSP in soil C sequestration under global
environmental change scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

abstract = {Sudden aspen decline (SAD), present in many parts of North America, is the sudden dieback of branches, crown loss, and rapid mortality of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). We surveyed 21 plots in southwestern Colorado and categorized each plot by the mean percentage of recent crown loss (RCL) into three SAD levels: low SAD (0%-25% RCL), moderate SAD (25.1%-50% RCL), and high SAD (50.1%-100% RCL). Our research quantified the effects of SAD on microclimate and understory vegetation at the individual species and community level. Mean day surface, day subsurface, and night subsurface temperatures were warmer in high SAD stands than in low ones. High SAD stands had lower soil moisture, lower litter and duff depth, higher bare soil cover, higher photosynthetically active radiation, higher arbuscular mycorrhizal propagule densities, and higher grass biomass. Indicator plant species were uniquely associated with low and high SAD. Our study illustrates that SAD has multiple ecological effects on aspen understories, including a potential positive feedback in which warmer temperatures and decreased soil moisture, consequences of SAD, may lead to increased branch dieback and tree mortality, which would alter microclimate-making conditions more favorable to SAD and escalate the effects of SAD on understory vegetation.},

Numerous commercial AMF products are now available and are often used in preference to collecting indigenous AMF in treating restoration plants. Commercial AMF products are typically based on AMF strains exotic to the plant species and locations where they are used. We treated rooted cuttings of an endemic New Zealand tree species (Podocarpus cunninghamii) and an exotic and invasive grass (Agrostis capillaris) with an indigenous, pot-cultured AMF (Acaulospora laevis) and an exotic commercial AMF product (Glomus spp.). P. cunninghamii was grown in monoculture and together with A. capillaris, the latter to simulate field competition that often occurs in restoration plantings. In monoculture, the indigenous AMF resulted in significant increases in P. cunninghamii growth rates and tissue concentrations of both nitrogen and phosphorus. The commercial AMF had either no effect or a negative effect on P. cunninghamii growth and nutrient levels. A. capillaris growth and nutrient status were unaffected by the different AMF treatments. Competition eliminated any AMF benefit for P. cunninghamii. The results show that, for our chosen indigenous woody plant species, the commercially available AMF did not improve its early growth and nutrient acquisition in monoculture while, over the same period, the indigenous AMF induced positive growth and nutrient responses. These results have potential implications for forest restoration, particularly for nursery production of indigenous woody species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The effects of nitrogen (N) deposition on plant litter and soil organic matter decomposition differ depending on the stage of decomposition (early, late, and final stages). The effects can be divided further into direct and indirect ones. Direct effects: additions of ammonium and nitrate to fresh, newly shed litter stimulate the initial decomposition of celluloses and solubles. By contrast, addition of the same compounds to humus (final stages) clearly suppresses activity. This was seen in all studies reviewed and for several types of humus. Indirect effects: long-term deposition leads to increases in litter concentrations of N and other nutrients. This N in litter forms "natural" organic compounds and the resulting effects are similar to those resulting from natural variation among litter types. Thus, initial decomposition is generally higher for N (nutrient) rich plant litters than for litters with a lower N (nutrient) content In later stages, at which lignin-degradation rates regulate litter decomposition, N has a retarding effect on decomposition. Significant negative correlations have also been found between N concentrations in humus and respiration rate. There probably is a sink for deposited N in the humus. We may conclude that N storage in humus is regulated by a positive feedback mechanism. Raised levels of N resulting from N deposition cause more humus to be left in the system, and the resulting lower levels of Mn further retards humus decomposition, thus leading to an increased storage of N in humus. Thus, when calculating critical loads it would be incorrect to assume that N pools in the humus remain at a steady state.},

This study determined the amount of C stocks in the different decomposing layers of forest floor, mainly litter, hemic and sapric materials. The abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal root colonisation differed among forest floor fractions. Forest floor was measured for depth, area density, dry mass and carbon fraction separately in Sungai Kial Forest Reserve, Pahang, Malaysia to calculate C stocks. Percentages of root colonisation in the hemic and sapric materials were investigated. The results showed that forest floor C stocks were significantly higher in hemic (5 Mg C ha−1) and sapric (7.7 Mg C ha−1) compared with the litter fragments (1.5 Mg C ha−1). Mycorrhizal root colonisation was significantly higher (75%) in the toeslope compared with the summit area in the hemic materials.

abstract = {Deadwood is an important legacy structure in managed forests, providing continuity in shelter and resource availability for many organisms and acting as a vehicle by which nutrients can be passed from one stand to the next following a harvest. Despite existing at the interface between below- and above-ground systems, however, much remains unknown about the role woody debris plays in linking these zones. Moreover, it remains untested whether the accelerative effects of wood-feeding insects on wood decomposition influence tree growth or nutritional status in forests. In this study, we added different quantities of pine logs to the bases of saplings in two-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations in Mississippi, USA. We included a treatment in which subterranean termites (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae: Reticulitermes) were excluded from logs to determine how these insects affect the release of nutrients from wood and, in turn, tree growth. After 51 months of decomposition, we quantified below-ground effects by measuring microbial biomass, plant-available forms of N, and ectomycorrhizal diversity associated with fine tree roots. Meanwhile, above-ground measurements focused on the elemental concentrations in decomposing wood either protected or unprotected from termites and tree metrics related to growth and nutrient status. We found additions of wood to significantly increase nitrate and potential net nitrification relative to reference treatments but detected no significant effects on tree growth, needle nitrogen concentrations, or ectomycorrhizal diversity. Soil nitrate and potential net nitrification were higher under protected vs. unprotected logs, and plant-available forms of N were mostly more abundant short distances away from both protected and unprotected logs than directly under them. The wood of logs protected from termites had significantly lower concentrations of most elements compared to that of unprotected logs, largely due to the large amounts of soil imported into unprotected logs by termites. Termite exclusion had no measurable effect on tree growth, nutritional status, or ectomycorrhizal diversity, however. Our findings indicate that deadwood and termites both contribute to the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties but may have limited short-term local effects on tree growth. Longer-term studies and studies on less fertile sites are needed. {\textcopyright} 2017 Ulyshen et al.},

abstract = {Purpose: Forest recovery from disturbance can alter soil nitrogen (N) status as a result of complex interactions in plant-soil system. The $\delta$15N and $\delta$18O are indicators that integrate complex soil N processes and can help elucidate changes in soil N status. Our objectives were to evaluate differences in soil N status among different forest recovery stages in karst plateau in southwestern China. Methods: We established a forest recovery gradient with sites in cropland, abandoned cropland, shrub land, and early- and late-successional forests. We measured concentrations and isotopic compositions of soil total N, ammonium (NH4+), and nitrate (NO3−), and $\delta$15N of plant tissue. Results: With increased levels of recovery, concentrations of soil total N increased, and $\delta$15N of soil total N ($\delta$15NSTN) decreased at 0 $\sim$ 10 cm depth. A positive relationship between $\delta$15NSTN in surface soil and $\delta$15N of plant (P < 0.05) suggested that recovery of plant biomass was the main contributor to soil N recovery. A large difference between $\delta$15N of litter and $\delta$15NSTN demonstrated an important dependence of plants on mycorrhizal fungi for N acquisition. $\delta$15N of NH4+ was lower than $\delta$15NSTN, and a significant correlation between $\delta$15N and $\delta$18O of NO3− was observed only in late-successional forest (slope = l.4), indicating that gas N emission had a minor contribution to N loss. Ratio of ammonium N to nitrate N was < 1 (except in cropland), suggesting low risk of leaching. Conclusions: Forest recovery promoted soil N recovery, and reduced soil N loss in karst plateau. However, N limitation persisted throughout forest recovery stages. {\textcopyright} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {Forest ecosystems are important sinks for rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2. In previous research, we showed that net primary production (NPP) increased by 23 ± 2% when four experimental forests were grown under atmospheric concentrations of CO2 predicted for the latter half of this century. Because nitrogen (N) availability commonly limits forest productivity, some combination of increased N uptake from the soil and more efficient use of the N already assimilated by trees is necessary to sustain the high rates of forest NPP under free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE). In this study, experimental evidence demonstrates that the uptake of N increased under elevated CO2 at the Rhinelander, Duke, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory FACE sites, yet fertilization studies at the Duke and Oak Ridge National Laboratory FACE sites showed that tree growth and forest NPP were strongly limited by N availability. By contrast, nitrogen-use efficiency increased under elevated CO2 at the POP-EUROFACE site, where fertilization studies showed that N was not limiting to tree growth. Some combination of increasing fine root production, increased rates of soil organic matter decomposition, and increased allocation of carbon (C) to mycorrhizal fungi is likely to account for greater N uptake under elevated CO2. Regardless of the specific mechanism, this analysis shows that the larger quantities of C entering the below-ground system under elevated CO2 result in greater N uptake, even in N-limited ecosystems. Biogeochemical models must be reformulated to allow C transfers below ground that result in additional N uptake under elevated CO2. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Analysis of stable isotope ratios of N and C provides a powerful tool for disentangling food web structure.

The combined measurement of $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C provided insights into the compartmentalization of the soil animal food web. Leaf litter feeders were separated from animals relying mainly on recent belowground carbon resources and from animals feeding on older carbon. The trophic pathway of leaf litter-feeding species appears to be a dead end, presumably because leaf litter feeders (mainly diplopods and oribatid mites) are unavailable to predators due to large size and/or strong sclerotization. Endogeic earthworms that rely on older carbon also appear to exist in predator-free space. The data suggest that the largest trophic compartment constitutes of ectomycorrhizal feeders and their predators. Additionally, there is a smaller trophic compartment consisting of predators likely feeding on enchytraeids and potentially nematodes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The humid tropics exert a disproportionately large influence over terrestrial C storage, but C allocation and belowground retention in these ecosystems remain poorly quantified. Using mass balance and 13C isotope methods, we examined the effects of afforestation and fertilization, two land-use changes of large-scale importance, on belowground C cycling at a humid tropical site in Hawaii. Here we report that in unfertilized plots, 80% of the C allocated belowground by trees to roots and mycorrhizae was returned to the atmosphere within 1 year; 9% of the belowground C flux was retained in coarse roots and 11% was retained as new soil C. The gains in new soil C were offset entirely by losses of old soil C. Further, while fertilization early in stand development increased C storage in the litter layer and in coarse roots, it reduced by 22% the flux of C moving through roots and mycorrhizae into mineral soils. Because soil C formation rates related strongly to rhizosphere C flux, fertilization may reduce an already limited capacity of these forests to sequester decay-resistant soil C. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

During two growing seasons after sod cutting, the growth of pine seedlings was significantly enhanced compared to plots with the organic layer left intact. Some epiedaphic soil animals, such as ants, spiders and certain entomobryid collembolan, were more active (pitfall sampling) on sod-cut plots. By the end of the second growing season numbers of enchytraeids were greater in the exposed mineral soil than in the mineral soil under the forest floor. Trenching induced changes in microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) pattern and collembolan community structure with decreased numbers of collembolans and biomass of fungi in organic soil of uncut plots. In addition, N content of pine seedlings increased after trenching. Overall, the effects of trenching on the measured variables were similar in sod-cut and uncut plots. We conclude that the effects of mechanical site preparation on decomposers and decomposition processes can be explained partly by exclusion of mycorrhizal-root connections and partly by a decrease in unfavourable conditions created by the organic soil layer and ground vegetation.},

We assessed the fungal communities of Andosol topsoil at 1 cm and 10 cm soil depth. The soil samples were obtained from a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance; specifically, plots were located within pristine forest, overstory-managed, and clearcut conditions. We used a cultivation-independent molecular barcoding approach to assess fungal diversity and identify 1,173 OTUs from which 401 were assigned to a functional guild. While we found higher phylogenetic richness in clear-cut conditions, these soils had higher relative abundances of plant pathogen fungi and lower relative abundances of saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi compared to the other treatments. The opposite pattern was found in pristine forest. Thus, fungal species richness itself does not seem to reflect ecosystem health. Interestingly though, the lower phylogenetic diversity found in pristine forest was compensated by a higher diversity of fungi involved in nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2017, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.

abstract = {We analysed stable isotopes of N in a spruce forest under ambient rainfall (no further manipulation of the atmospheric input) and clean rain application (10 years of reduced inorganic N- and acid-constituent input). The objectives of the study were to assess whether or not the natural 15N abundance would function as an indicator for the N-status of our forest ecosystems. For this purpose, natural 15N abundance values were measured in needles, litter fall, roots, soil, bulk precipitation, throughfall and soil water of both plots. In the bulk precipitation and throughfall the $\delta$15N values of NO3-N were in the range reported by other studies (-16 to + 23‰). In both plots, the throughfall was greatly depleted of 15N compared to the bulk precipitation and this was attributed to nitrification in the canopy leaves, leading to $\delta$15N-depleted nitrate production in the leaves that leaches down the soil surface. Nitrate in seepage water showed a general increase in $\delta$15N values when it passes through the upper mineral soil (10 cm soil depth) and infiltrates into deeper mineral soil horizons (100 cm soil depth), similar to the $\delta$15N enrichment of total nitrogen in the mineral soil. We observed 15N depletion in both green needles and litter fall at the clean rain plot, compared to the N-saturated control plot. We assumed it to be due to increased mycorrhizal N-uptake under N limited, i.e. clean rain conditions which are indicated by relatively lower N concentrations of green needles. With respect to the vertical gradient of the 15N abundance in the forest floor, both plots differ from each other, showing an untypical peak of $\delta$15N depletion in the humus layer, which is more pronounced at the control plot. In contrast to the mineral soil where mineralisation is a dominant process for fractionation we attribute the $\delta$15N pattern in the forest floor to additional processes like litter input and immobilisation. We conclude that the $\delta$15 natural abundance analysis is helpful for interpreting the N-status of forest ecosystems but further research is needed especially with respect to the soil-root interface.},

FHOM was collected from a birch forest and placed in transparent observation chambers with (M) or without (NM) plants of Betula pendula Roth, the roots of which were infected by Paxillus involutus (Fr.) Fr. The fungus colonized the FHOM of the M chambers, and after different periods of occupation the activities of protease, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase and phosphomonoesterase were determined in colonized and uncolonized substrate. Activities of protease and polyphenol oxidase increased in organic matter that had been occupied for 28–50 d, and remained elevated in FHOM that had been occupied for 50–98 d. However, although activity of phosphomonoesterase increased in FHOM that had been colonized for 28–50 d, amounts in FHOM colonized for 50–98 d decreased to below that found in uncolonized material. No difference in peroxidase activity was detected between colonized and uncolonized organic matter. The results are discussed in relation to the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in nutrient cycling processes in temperate forest ecosystems. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract = {Mycorrhizal fungi have considerable effects on soil carbon (C) storage, as they control the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), by modifying the amount of soil nitrogen (N) available for free-living microbes. Through their access to organic N, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi compete with free-living soil microbes; this competition is thought to slow down SOM decomposition. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi cannot decompose SOM, and therefore must wait for N to first be processed by free-living microbes. It is unclear what form of N the ECM fungi and free-living microbes compete for, or which microbial groups compete for N with ECM fungi. To investigate this, we focused on the N transformation steps (i.e., the degradation of high-molecular-weight organic matter, mineralization, and nitrification) and the microbes driving each step. Simple comparisons between AM forests and ECM forests are not sufficient to assert that mycorrhizal types would determine the N transformation steps in soil, because soil physiochemistry, which strongly affects N transformation steps, differs between the forests. We used an aridity gradient with large differences in soil moisture, pH, and SOM quantity and quality, to distinguish the mycorrhizal and physicochemical effects on N transformation. Soil samples (0–10 cm depth) were collected from AM-symbiotic black locust forests under three aridity levels, and from ECM-symbiotic oak forests under two aridity levels. Soil physicochemical properties, extractable N dynamics and abundance, composition, and function of soil microbial communities were measured. In ECM forests, the ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotic abundance was low, whereas that of ECM fungi was high, resulting in lower nitrate N content than in AM forests. Since ECM forests did not have lower saprotrophic fungal abundance and prokaryotic decompositional activity than the AM forests, the hypothesis that ECM fungi could reduce SOM decay and ammonification by free-living microbes, might not hold in ECM forests. However, the limitation of ECM fungi on nitrate N production would result in a feedback that will accelerate plant dependence on these fungi, thereby raising soil C storage through an increase in the ECM biomass and plant C investment in soils. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract = {Due to the standing biomass and turnover of fungal biomass in forest topsoils, decomposition of fungal biomass represents an important process. Within plant litter, dead fungal biomass represents a unique substrate that is typically nitrogen (N)-rich and is assumed to be subject to rapid decomposition. However, our current knowledge of mycelial decomposition has been largely derived from short-term studies, often limited to a single mycelia type, and the guilds of microbial mycelium decomposers have not yet been described. Furthermore, nutrient content may vary largely in fungal mycelia, and the consequences of this variation are unknown. Here, we followed the decomposition of dead biomass of 12 ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic fungi of a temperate forest using mycobags incubated in litter for 3 and 9 weeks. Loss of substrate dry mass, microbial biomass content and community composition as well as the activity of extracellular enzymes reflecting microbial activity on this substrate were followed. Decomposition rates of fungal biomass were typically high (0.13–0.30 week−1), yet variable. The decomposition includes a rapid initial phase followed by a slower turnover of remaining biomass. The initial nitrogen content that ranged between 1.5% and 10% appeared to be the most important factor that affected colonization of dead mycelia and their decomposition. The relatively high content of N makes fungal mycelia an attractive resource in the N-poor habitat of plant litter. Decomposition of mycelia was performed by a guild of specialist decomposers that showed rather low abundance in surrounding litter and changed during decomposition. Bacteria were much more abundant on dead fungal biomass than in the surrounding litter and appeared to play an important role in decomposition. Fungi associated with dead mycelia were mainly represented by yeasts and moulds. Although the importance of fungal mycelia for the nutrient cycling in forests is not yet clear, the fact that they are turned over rapidly suggests that they may represent an important and dynamic pool of carbon and nitrogen. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The importance of the ground vegetation and soil microbial biomass as sinks for nitrogen following conventional (CH) and whole-tree (WH) harvesting in a Sitka spruce plantation in N. Wales (UK), were investigated. Lysimeters containing the organic horizons were established with the treatments brash, Agrostis capillaris (L.) and/or Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) seedlings in a limited factorial design. Following a period of 15 months, during which chemical analysis of the lysimeter leachates was carried out, the lysimeters were destructively sampled and the vegetation and soil microbial biomass nitrogen pools measured. The effect of the different treatments on the decomposition rate of the organic matter and the growth and nutrient status of the young Sitka spruce trees was also determined. A comparison of the nitrogen pools and the cumulative leachate results identified the grass as the major sink for nitrogen with uptake over a 15 month period equivalent to 2.6 g N m-2 at 50-75% cover. Uptake by the Sitka spruce was also significant with net uptake ranging from 0.6 g N m-2 when growing with the grass to 1.74 g N m-2 when planted within a pile of brash. The microbial biomass nitrogen pool was unchanged by the presence of the grass species but was significantly increased in the lysimeters containing brash and/or Sitka spruce (possibly owing to the presence of mycorrhizal fungi). The microbial N pool was greatest in the treatment containing the combination of the trees planted within the brash, with 3.49 (±0.52) g N m-2 as microbial biomass N compared with 1.99 (±0.24) g N m-2 in the control lysimeters containing neither brash nor trees. The growth of the Sitka spruce was highly variable within treatments, however, the mean biomass m-2 doubled if planted within the brash, and also resulted in elevated foliar concentrations of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. When in competition with the grass, tree biomass was halved, tree needles appeared chlorotic and phosphorus concentrations were halved. The management implications for harvesting intensity on upland sites are considered. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

We used the genus Amanita, an iconic group of mushroom-forming fungi engaged in ectomycorrhizal symbioses with plants, to identify both the origins and potential genetic changes maintaining the stability of this mutualism. A multi-gene phylogeny reveals one origin of the symbiosis within Amanita, with a single transition from saprotrophic decomposition of dead organic matter to biotrophic dependence on host plants for carbon. Associated with this transition are the losses of two cellulase genes, each of which plays a critical role in extracellular decomposition of organic matter. However a third gene, which acts at later stages in cellulose decomposition, is retained by many, but not all, ectomycorrhizal species. Experiments confirm that symbiotic Amanita species have lost the ability to grow on complex organic matter and have therefore lost the capacity to live in forest soils without carbon supplied by a host plant. Irreversible losses of decomposition pathways are likely to play key roles in the evolutionary stability of these ubiquitous mutualisms. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wolfe et al.},

abstract = {Decomposition of wood is an important component of global carbon cycling. Most wood decomposition models are based on tree characteristics and environmental conditions; however, they do not include community dynamics of fungi that are the major wood decomposers. We examined the factors explaining variation in sapwood decay in oak tree stumps two and five years after cutting. Wood moisture content was significantly correlated with sapwood decay in younger stumps, whereas ITS-based composition and species richness of the fungal community were the best predictors for mass loss in the older stumps. Co-occurrence analysis showed that, in freshly cut trees and in younger stumps, fungal communities were nonrandomly structured, whereas fungal communities in old stumps could not be separated from a randomly assembled community. These results indicate that the most important factors explaining variation in wood decay rates can change over time and that the strength of competitive interactions between fungi in decaying tree stumps may level off with increased wood decay. Our field analysis further suggests that ascomycetes may have a prominent role in wood decay, but their wood-degrading abilities need to be further tested under controlled conditions. The next challenging step will be to integrate fungal community assembly processes in wood decay models to improve carbon sequestration estimates of forests. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Questions remain as to which soil nutrients limit primary production in tropical forests. Phosphorus (P) has long been considered the primary limiting element in lowland forests, but recent evidence demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in response to nutrient addition, highlighting a need to understand and diagnose nutrient limitation across diverse forests. Fine-root characteristics including their abundance, functional traits, and mycorrhizal symbionts can be highly responsive to changes in soil nutrients and may help to diagnose nutrient limitation. Here, we document the response of fine roots to long-term nitrogen (N), P, and potassium (K) fertilization in a lowland forest in Panama. Because this experiment has demonstrated that N and K together limit tree growth and P limits fine litter production, we hypothesized that fine roots would also respond to nutrient addition. Specifically we hypothesized that N, P, and K addition would reduce the biomass, diameter, tissue density, and mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots, and increase nutrient concentration in root tissue. Most morphological root traits responded to the single addition of K and the paired addition of N and P, with the greatest response to all three nutrients combined. The addition of N, P, and K together reduced fine-root biomass, length, and tissue density, and increased specific root length, whereas root diameter remained unchanged. Nitrogen addition did not alter root N concentration, but P and K addition increased root P and K concentration, respectively. Mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots declined with N, increased with P, and was unresponsive to K addition. Although plant species composition remains unchanged after 14 years of fertilization, fine-root characteristics responded to N, P, and K addition, providing some of the strongest stand-level responses in this experiment. Multiple soil nutrients regulate fine-root abundance, morphological and chemical traits, and their association with mycorrhizal fungi in a species-rich lowland tropical forest.},

abstract = {Ecosystems often show differential sensitivity to chronic nitrogen (N) deposition; hence, a critical challenge is to improve our understanding of how and why site-specific factors mediate biogeochemical responses to N enrichment. We examined the extent to which N impacts on soil carbon (C) and N dynamics depend on microbial resource stoichiometry. We added N to forest plots dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees, which have litter and soil pools rich in organic N and relatively wide C:N ratios, and adjacent forest plots dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees, which have litter and soil pools rich in inorganic N and relatively narrow C:N ratios. While microbes in both plot types exhibited fairly strict biomass homeostasis, microbes in AM-and ECM-dominated plots differed in their physiological responses to N addition. Microbes in ECM plots responded to N enrichment by decreasing their investment in N-acquisition enzymes (relative to C-acquisition enzymes) and increasing N mineralization rates (relative to C mineralization rates), suggesting that N addition alleviated microbial N demand. In contrast, heterotrophic microbial activities in AM plots were unaffected by N addition, most likely as a result of N-induced increases in net nitrification (60% increase relative to control plots) and nitrate mobilization (e.g., sixfold increases in mobilization relative to control plots). Combined, our findings suggest the stoichiometric differences between AM and ECM soils are the primary drivers of the observed responses. Plant and microbial communities characterized by wide C:N are more susceptible to N-induced changes in decomposition and soil C dynamics, whereas communities characterized by narrow C:N are more susceptible to N-induced nitrate leaching losses. Hence, the biogeochemical consequences of N deposition in temperate forests may be driven by the stoichiometry of the dominant trees and their associated microbes. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {In soils under forest conditions and on seedlings grown under glasshouse conditions jarrah mycorrhizae exhibited strong habitat preferences. Litter on the forest floor was the main site for the formation of the white and brown ectomycorrhizae, and removal of the litter layer by prescribed burning reduced by 90% the numbers of these two ectomycorrhizae. Black ectornycorrhizae were dominant in the mineral horizons of soil and were unaffected by the type of surface litter. In glasshouse experiments litter from different plant species significantly influenced formation of ectomycorrhizae by jarrah seedlings. Litter from Acacia pulchella R. Br. was favourable for formation of ectomycorrhizae but ectornycorrhizae were absent from Banksia grandis Willd. litter. Black ectomycorrhizae, Hysterangium-initiated ectomycorrhizae and vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae formed on jarrah seedlings in the soils used in glasshouse studies. Addition of nitrogen and phosphorus to these soils influenced the relative abundance of mycorrhizae. It is postulated that inoculum levels, nutrient status of litter and soil and the presence of compounds inhibitory to fungal growth are critical in determining the abundance of mycorrhizae. Factors affecting formation of mycorrhizae by jarrah and the ecological implications of these results are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1984, CSIRO. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Biodiversity of the forest fungi of central India (Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and part of Maharashtra) has been recorded. A total of 838 fungi belonging to 321 genera (199 genera of ascomycetes, 107 basidiomycetes, 10 phycomycetes, and 3 myxomycetes) were recorded on different substrates from the forests. Among them, 529 species belong to ascomycete, 282 to basidiomycete, and 26 to lower fungi and myxomycete. The maximum number of fungi, 347 recorded on leaf, followed by 259 on stem and wood, 121 in soil/on ground, 33 in litter, 19 on roots, 24 on seed/pods/seedlings and 2 on insects, were reported on leaf causing common leaf diseases. Fungi recorded on stem, branches, twigs, culms, etc. are either causing cankers, twig blights, die back, etc. or decay and deterioration of these organs in standing trees as well as fallen parts on the forest floor. Top dying and root rot of teak caused by Phomopsis tectonae and Helicobasidium compactum are the diseases causing serious damage in plantations of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, respectively. Some fungi, for example species of Amanita, Astraeus, Boletus, Geastrum, Lepiota, Pisolithus, Ramaria, Russula, Scleroderma, Thelephora, etc., produce ectomycorrhizaewhile species of Coriolopsis, Daedalea, Daldinia, Earliella, Favolus, Flavodon, Funalia, Ganoderma, Hypoxylon, Hymenochaete, Inonotus, Irpex, Junghunia, Lenzites, Microporus, Navisporus, Phellinus, Polyporus, Polystictus, Poria, Pyrofomes, Rigidoporus, Skeletocutis, Stereum, Tremates, Xylaria, etc. are the common wood-decay fungi. Common mushroom collected from the ground and decaying wood and litter are species of Agaricus, Amanita, Agrocybe, Coprinus, Lepiota, Marasmius, Mycena, Pleurotus, Termitomyces, Tricholoma, and Volvariella. Root rot of Dalbergia sissoo and Acacia catechu caused by Ganoderma lucidum is posing a serious threat in central India. Spongipellis spumeus causes root rot in the mature trees of Albizia procera and is also causing considerable damage. Some recently recorded new diseases include vascular wilt of aonla caused by Fusarium solani and root rot of teak seedlings (only occurs under water stress condition) caused by Helicobasidium compactum and Tritirachium roseum. Two new genera and 30 new species were described from central India during the last 5 years. Recently described new species include Asterostomella shoreae, Cheilymenia jabalpurensis, Nitschkia tectonae, and Passalora emblicae. In central India over 2,700 fungi were collected during the last 15 years, out of them 12.3 % fungi were collected only once and are considered as threatened and needs conservation. Only 1.8 % fungi were frequently collected (more than 11 times during this period) including Phomopsis tectonae, whose population is recorded increasing in teak growing areas. The data indicate that the population of major fungi is dwindling with time. {\textcopyright} Springer India 2014 This work is subject. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In boreal ecosystems plant production is often limited by low availability of nitrogen. Nitrogen retention in below-ground organic pools plays an important role in restricting recirculation to plants and thereby hampers forest production. Saprotrophic fungi are commonly assigned to different decomposer strategies, but how these relate to nitrogen cycling remains to be understood. Decomposition of Scots pine needle litter was studied in axenic microcosms with the ligninolytic litter decomposing basidiomycete Gymnopus androsaceus or the stress tolerant ascomycete Chalara longipes. Changes in chemical composition were followed by 13C CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy and nitrogen dynamics was assessed by the addition of a 15N tracer. Decomposition by C. longipes resulted in nitrogen retention in non-hydrolysable organic matter, enriched in aromatic and alkylic compounds, whereas the ligninolytic G. androsaceus was able to access this pool, counteracting nitrogen retention. Our observations suggest that differences in decomposing strategies between fungal species play an important role in regulating nitrogen retention and release during litter decomposition, implying that fungal community composition may impact nitrogen cycling at the ecosystem level. {\textcopyright} FEMS 2019.

Research has demonstrated that mycorrhizas also play an important role in the uptake of nutrients from organic materials. Ericoid mycorrhizas and some ectomycorrhizas (EM) species have the potential to degrade structural compounds of plant litter and mobilize nitrogen and phosphorus directly from organic polymers so that they are able to short circuit the microbial mineralization process.

abstract = {Rationale Data on the bulk stable isotope composition of soil bacteria and bacterivorous soil animals are required to estimate the nutrient and energy fluxes via bacterial channels within detrital food webs. We measured the isotopic composition of slime molds (Myxogastria, Amoebozoa), a group of soil protozoans forming macroscopic spore-bearing fruiting bodies. An analysis of largely bacterivorous slime molds can provide information on the bulk stable isotope composition of soil bacteria. Methods Fruiting bodies of slime molds were collected in a monsoon tropical forest of Cat Tien National Park, Vietnam, and analyzed by continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Prior to stable isotope analysis, carbonates were removed from a subset of samples by acidification. To estimate the trophic position of slime molds, their $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N values were compared with those of plant debris, soil, microbial destructors (litter-decomposing, humus-decomposing, and ectomycorrhizal fungi) and members of higher trophic levels (oribatid mites, termites, predatory macroinvertebrates). Results Eight species of slime molds represented by at least three independent samples were 3-6‰ enriched in 13C and 15N relative to plant litter. A small but significant difference in the $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N values suggests that different species of myxomycetes can differ in feeding behavior. The slime molds were enriched in 15N compared with litter-decomposing fungi, and depleted in 15N compared with mycorrhizal or humus-decomposing fungi. Slime mold sporocarps and plasmodia largely overlapped with oribatid mites in the isotopic bi-plot, but were depleted in 15N compared with predatory invertebrates and humiphagous termites. Conclusions A comparison with reference groups of soil organisms suggests strong trophic links of slime molds to saprotrophic microorganisms which decompose plant litter, but not to humus-decomposing microorganisms or to mycorrhizal fungi. Under the assumption that slime molds are primarily feeding on bacteria, the isotopic similarity of slime molds and mycophagous soil animals indicates that saprotrophic soil bacteria and fungi are similar in bulk isotopic composition.

abstract = {Global changes such as atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition can alter the structure of microbial communities, but a mechanistic understanding of the linkages between community structure and ecosystem function is lacking. Here we apply a trait-based framework to an analysis of litter fungal communities in a temperate forest exposed to >20 years simulated N addition in order to develop hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying community responses and resulting changes in ecosystem function. We performed metabarcoding of the total and active fungal communities and measured extracellular enzyme activity in leaf litter after it decomposed for approximately two years in a long-term simulated N deposition experiment. We found that N fertilization decreased the relative abundance of six species in the active community that were highly correlated with lignin decomposing enzyme activity. Four of these species have currently unknown taxonomic identity and should be targets for isolation and further characterization. Nitrogen fertilization also increased species richness and relative abundance of yeasts in the total community and decreased their relative activity levels, suggesting these species may be dormant or otherwise inactive. Together these responses may contribute to accumulation of organic matter in soils by favoring yeasts that are not strong enzyme producers and by disfavoring the fungal species that are most active in litter decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Almost all saprotrophic fungi sporophores were enriched in 13C relative to their substrate. In contrast, they exhibited no or very little shift of $\delta$15N. Judging from the amount of C discrimination, ectomycorrhizal fungi seem to acquire carbon from their host or from dead organic matter. Some ectomycorrhizal species seem able to acquire nitrogen from dead organic matter and could be able to transfer it to their host without nitrogen fractionation, while others supply their host with 15N- depleted nitrogen. Moreover ectomycorrhizal species displayed a significant N fractionation during sporophore differentiation, while saprotrophic fungi did not. {\textcopyright} INRA, EDP Sciences, 2007.},

abstract = {Saprotrophic fungi are the primary decomposers of plant litter in temperate forests, and their activity is critical for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Simulated atmospheric N deposition is associated with reduced fungal biomass, shifts in fungal community structure, slowed litter decay, and soil C accumulation. Although rarely studied, N deposition may also result in novel selective pressures on fungi, affecting evolutionary trajectories. To directly test if long-term N enrichment reshapes fungal responses to N, we isolated decomposer fungi from a long-term (28 yr) N-addition experiment and used a common garden approach to compare growth rates and decay abilities of isolates from control and N-amended plots. Both growth and decay were significantly altered by long-term exposure to N enrichment. Changes in growth rates were idiosyncratic, as different species grew either more quickly or more slowly after exposure to N, but litter decay by N isolates was consistent and generally lower compared to control isolates of the same species, a response not readily reversed when N isolates were grown in control (low N) environments. Changes in fungal responses accompany and perhaps drive previously observed N-induced shifts in fungal diversity, community composition, and litter decay dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

A better understanding of the dynamics and drivers of root-associated fungal communities is essential to predict long-term soil C storage and climate feedbacks in northern ecosystems. We used 454-pyrosequencing to identify fungal communities across fine-scaled soil profiles in a 5000 yr fire-driven boreal forest chronosequence, with the aim of pinpointing shifts in fungal community composition that may underlie variation in below-ground C sequestration. In early successional-stage forests, higher abundance of cord-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi (such as Cortinarius and Suillus species) was linked to rapid turnover of mycelial biomass and necromass, efficient nitrogen (N) mobilization and low C sequestration. In late successional-stage forests, cord formers declined, while ericoid mycorrhizal ascomycetes continued to dominate, potentially facilitating long-term humus build-up through production of melanized hyphae that resist decomposition. Our results suggest that cord-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi play opposing roles in below-ground C storage. We postulate that, by affecting turnover and decomposition of fungal tissues, mycorrhizal fungal identity and growth form are critical determinants of C and N sequestration in boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors New Phytologist {\textcopyright} 2014 New Phytologist Trust.},

Competition between the two guilds may cause the so-called Gadgil effect, i.e., decreased litter decomposition rates resulting in increased carbon storage in soil. The Gadgil effect was supposed to even affect global climate, highlighting the necessity to understand fungal distribution and interactions in soil. Searching for evidence of competition between saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi, we analyzed the distribution of fungi along a well-stratified vertical spruce forest soil profile in two seasons, i.e., autumn and the following spring. The different soil strata (i.e., two mineral horizons and two organic layers) underneath the litter layer were colonized by distinct fungal communities, which included roughly consistent proportions of all fungal guilds and phyla at each time. However, the community composition changed quantitatively between the sampling dates. Along the vertical soil profile, it differed mostly between the organic layers and the mineral soil, which is supposed to be due to differences in the predominant energy sources (i.e., aboveground litter and rhizodeposition, respectively). Network analyses revealed co-occurrences (i.e., positive correlations of individual abundances) to outweigh mutual exclusions (i.e., negative correlations) between individual fungi in each soil stratum and season. This also applied for interactions between saprotrophic and EcM fungi. Network analyses therefore provided no indications for a possible Gadgil effect. However, considering individual nutrient use efficiencies might refine insights from network analyses in future studies and facilitate linking community dynamics to ecosystem processes. {\textcopyright} 2018, German Mycological Society and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {Despite the major importance of soil biota in nutrient and energy fluxes, interactions in soil food webs are poorly understood. Here we provide an overview of recent advances in uncovering the trophic structure of soil food webs using natural variations in stable isotope ratios. We discuss approaches of application, normalization and interpretation of stable isotope ratios along with methodological pitfalls. Analysis of published data from temperate forest ecosystems is used to outline emerging concepts and perspectives in soil food web research. In contrast to aboveground and aquatic food webs, trophic fractionation at the basal level of detrital food webs is large for carbon and small for nitrogen stable isotopes. Virtually all soil animals are enriched in 13 C as compared to plant litter. This ‘detrital shift' likely reflects preferential uptake of 13 C-enriched microbial biomass and underlines the importance of microorganisms, in contrast to dead plant material, as a major food resource for the soil animal community. Soil organic matter is enriched in 15 N and 13 C relative to leaf litter. Decomposers inhabiting mineral soil layers therefore might be enriched in 15 N resulting in overlap in isotope ratios between soil-dwelling detritivores and litter-dwelling predators. By contrast, 13 C content varies little between detritivores in upper litter and in mineral soil, suggesting that they rely on similar basal resources, i.e. little decomposed organic matter. Comparing vertical isotope gradients in animals and in basal resources can be a valuable tool to assess trophic interactions and dynamics of organic matter in soil. As indicated by stable isotope composition, direct feeding on living plant material as well as on mycorrhizal fungi is likely rare among soil invertebrates. Plant carbon is taken up predominantly by saprotrophic microorganisms and channelled to higher trophic levels of the soil food web. However, feeding on photoautotrophic microorganisms and non-vascular plants may play an important role in fuelling soil food webs. The trophic niche of most high-rank animal taxa spans at least two trophic levels, implying the use of a wide range of resources. Therefore, to identify trophic species and links in food webs, low-rank taxonomic identification is required. Despite overlap in feeding strategies, stable isotope composition of the high-rank taxonomic groups reflects differences in trophic level and in the use of basal resources. Different taxonomic groups of predators and decomposers are likely linked to different pools of organic matter in soil, suggesting different functional roles and indicating that trophic niches in soil animal communities are phylogenetically structured. During last two decades studies using stable isotope analysis have elucidated the trophic structure of soil communities, clarified basal food resources of the soil food web and revealed links between above- and belowground ecosystem compartments. Extending the use of stable isotope analysis to a wider range of soil-dwelling organisms, including microfauna, and a larger array of ecosystems provides the perspective of a comprehensive understanding of the structure and functioning of soil food webs. {\textcopyright} 2018 Cambridge Philosophical Society},

abstract = {Background and Aims Temperate deciduous forest understoreys are experiencing widespread changes in community composition, concurrent with increases in rates of nitrogen supply. These shifts in plant abundance may be driven by interspecific differences in nutrient foraging (i.e. conservative vs. acquisitive strategies) and, thus, adaptation to contemporary nutrient loading conditions. This study sought to determine if interspecific differences in nutrient foraging could help explain patterns of shrub success and decline in eastern North American forests. Methods Using plants grown in a common garden, fine root traits associated with nutrient foraging were measured for six shrub species. Traits included the mean and skewness of the root diameter distribution, specific root length (SRL), C:N ratio, root tissue density, arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization and foraging precision. Aboveand below-ground productivity were also determined for the same plants, and population growth rates were estimated using data from a long-Term study of community dynamics. Root traits were compared among species and associations among root traits, measures of productivity and rates of population growth were evaluated. Key Results Species fell into groups having thick or thin root forms, which correspond to conservative vs. acquisitive nutrient foraging strategies. Interspecific variation in root morphology and tissue construction correlated with measures of productivity and rates of cover expansion. Of the four species with acquisitive traits, three were introduced species that have become invasive in recent decades, and the fourth was a weedy native. In contrast, the two species with conservative traits were historically dominant shrubs that have declined in abundance in eastern North American forests. Conclusions In forest understoreys of eastern North America, elevated nutrient availability may impose a filter on species success in addition to above-ground processes such as herbivory and overstorey canopy conditions. Shrubs that have root traits associated with rapid uptake of soil nutrients may be more likely to increase in abundance, while species without such traits may be less likely to keep pace with more productive species. {\textcopyright} The Author 2017.},

However, no consensus yet exists on the age estimate of the first Formicidae or on the origin of their eusociality. We review the fossil and biogeographical record of all known Cretaceous ants. We discuss the possible origin of the Formicidae with emphasis on the most primitive subfamily Sphecomyrminae according to its distribution and the Early Cretaceous palaeogeography. And we review the evidence of true castes and eusociality of the early ants regarding their morphological features and their manner of preservation in amber. The mid-Cretaceous amber forest from south-western France where some of the oldest known ants lived, corresponded to a moist tropical forest close to the shore with a dominance of gymnosperm trees but where angiosperms (flowering plants) were already diversified. This palaeoenvironmental reconstruction supports an initial radiation of ants in forest ground litter coincident with the rise of angiosperms, as recently proposed as an ecological explanation for their origin and successful evolution. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The ectomycorrhizal mycelium is a large component of boreal and temperate forest soil microbial biomass and the resulting necromass is likely to be an important source of nutrients for saprotrophic microorganisms. Here we test the effects of species richness of ectomycorrhizal mycelial biomass on short-term CO2 efflux by amending forest soil with necromass from 8 fungal species added separately and in mixtures of 2, 4 and 8 species. All additions of necromass rapidly increased soil CO2 efflux compared to unamended controls but CO2 efflux increased significantly with species richness. Efflux of CO2 did not correlate with the carbon (C) or nitrogen (N) contents or the C:N ratio of the added necromass. The study demonstrates that species diversity of dead ectomycorrhizal fungal hyphae can have important consequences for soil CO2 efflux, and suggests decomposition of hyphae is regulated by specific constituents of the nutrient pools in the necromass rather than the total quantities added. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Introduction This chapter reviews the distribution, mechanism and impact of mineral tunnelling by soil ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF). Most trees in boreal forests live in close relation with EMF (Smith & Read, 1997). These EMF mediate nutrient uptake; they form an extension of the tree roots. In turn they obtain carbohydrates from the tree. Over the years ectomycorrhizal (EM) research has a strong focus on nutrient acquisition by EMF from organic sources (Read, 1991). In boreal forest systems, however, minerals could also be an important nutrient source, especially for calcium, potassium and phosphorus (Likens et al., 1994, 1998; Blum et al., 2002). Recent developments in EM research suppose a role for EMF in mobilizing nutrients from minerals (see Wallander, Chapter 14, this volume). In 1997, Jongmans et al. described small tunnel-like features in feldspar and hornblende grains from Swedish forest soils. These tunnels have the shape of fungal hyphae: A constant width between 3 and 10 mm, smooth borders and a rounded end. In that way they differ from other weathering phenomena such as etch pitches and cracks (Fig. 13.1). In some tunnels hyphae were found. Jongmans et al. (1997) postulated that EMF created these tunnels by mineral dissolution through the exudation of low molecular-weight organic compounds and subsequent removal of the weathering products. The weathering products like calcium, magnesium and potassium are supposed to be transported to the tree roots. In this way the host tree has direct access to mineral-bound nutrients, bypassing the bulk soil solution (van Breemen et al., 2000a; Landeweert et al., 2001). {\textcopyright} British Mycological Society 2006.},

abstract = {The effects of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) and ectomycorrhizae on plant ecology are considered, with emphasis on 4 areas. 1) Mycotrophy in wild plants. Many natives have lower nutrient demands than crop plants and may therefore be less responsive to mycorrhizal infection. 2) The role of mycorrhizae in competition. Mycorrhizae figure in plant-plant competition for limited resources. Mycorrhizae are probably involved in allelopathic interactions between plants. Mycorrhizae could aid in competition between plants and microorganisms. Mycorrhizal roots are sometimes found in humus layers of the forest floor. Mycorrhizal fungi may influence the decomposition of plant detritus. The most important role of mycorrhizal roots in the organic layer may often be a close physical association with the most nutrient-rich microsites of the heterogeneous soil volume. The ability to allocate absorbing tissue to localized organic matter zones has been documented for roots of forest trees and for hyphae of VAM fungi. The advantageous physical placement may result in greater nutrient acquisition for the plant than would occur if root and hyphal distribution were random. 3) The occurrence of mycorrhizae in natural communities has not frequently been documented in ways that show the abundance of infection in the whole community. 4) Carbon allocation to the symbiosis. Estimates for VAM from a few percent to approx 50% of gross photosynthesis can be reconciled to some extent by considering the dynamic processes of root and mycelial turnover.-from Authors},

abstract = {Knowledge about the effects of tree species on soil physicochemical and microbial properties is crucial for sustainable forest management. The evaluation of these effects in common garden experiments may be advantageous compared to natural conditions due to the reduction of confounding factors such as differences in topography, microclimate, the age of the tree stand, the admixture of other tree species or soil type. In this study, we assessed the effects of 14 tree species grown for nearly 50 years in monospecific plots in the Siemianice Experimental Forest in Poland on soil microbial community assessed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, namely total, bacterial (G+, G−) and fungal biomass, fungi/bacteria ratio, G+/G− ratio, and microbial community structure, as well as on soil chemical properties, namely pH, organic C, total Ca, K, Mg, N, P, exchangeable Ca, K, Mg, N-NH4, N-NO3, S-SO4, and C/N ratio. Species richness (species number) and cover of undergrowth vegetation were also assessed. We found only moderate effects of tree species identity on soil. Significant differences were found in fungal biomass, fungi/bacteria ratio, and microbial community structure, with the highest fungal biomass under Betula pendula and Quercus rubra. Among chemical parameters, significant differences were observed in soil pH and base cations concentrations. The highest values of these parameters were under Acer pseudoplatanus, A. platanoides, and Tilia cordata. Total microbial, bacterial (G−), fungal biomass, and fungi/bacteria ratio were significantly higher under broadleaf than under coniferous species, while for G+/G− ratio the opposite was observed. Tree species with arbuscular mycorrhiza did not generally differ in their effects on soil microbial biomass from those with ectomycorrhiza. Total microbial and G+ bacterial biomass correlated positively with soil elements, mainly base cations, C, and N, while very few correlations were found between soil chemical properties and G− bacteria and fungi. Species richness and cover of undergrowth vegetation were not related to any of soil microbial properties. The lack of correlations between soil element contents, undergrowth vegetation, and some microbial groups may suggest that these microorganisms are primarily influenced by other soil/litter properties, for example secondary metabolite concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {1. Although nitrogen-fixing plants play a crucial role in maintaining high ecosystem productivity, their effects on forest diversity are greatly debated. Legumes can reduce local diversity because of the fertilization effect; however, they can also facilitate species coexistence through complementary resource utilization. 2. In natural forests, nitrogen requirements and biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) vary widely among legumes. We used leaf nitrogen isotopic composition to differentiate the level of BNF activity among seven legumes across a steep gradient of soil available nitrogen within a 60-ha stem-mapping plot in a montane tropical rainforest in Hainan Island, China, and we evaluated their spatial distribution and neighbourhood diversity. 3. Results show that the levels of BNF activity are tightly correlated with legume association to available soil nitrogen, where legumes associated with nitrogen-rich habitats exhibit surprisingly greater BNF activity and a more diverse neighbourhood. 4. Synthesis. These findings indicate that legumes satisfy their nitrogen-demanding metabolism through a synergy of habitat preference and BNF activity. High BNF activity drives local diversity by promoting complementary resource utilization rather than intensifying above-ground competition. This may be achieved by improving litter quality and stimulating mycorrhizal and microbial diversity. The abundance of nitrogen fixers in nitrogen-rich habitats also explains how legumes contribute to maintaining high levels of soil nitrogen in tropical forests. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors.

abstract = {In the rhizosphere, biotic and abiotic processes interact to create a zone distinct from the bulk soil that may strongly influence the biogeochemistry of forest ecosystems. This paper presents a conceptual model based upon three operationally defined soil-root compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere and soil-root interface) to assess nutrient availability in the mineral soil-root system. The model is supported by chemical and mineralogical analyses from bulk and rhizosphere soils collected from a Norway spruce forest. The rhizosphere was more intensively weathered and had accumulated more acidity, base cations and phosphorus than the bulk soil. The quantity and quality of organic matter regulate the reciprocal relationships between soil and roots with their associated biota. However, the biogeochemical role of organic matter in the rhizosphere still remains as an area in which more future research is needed. The mechanisms that may regulate nutrient availability in the rhizosphere are also discussed and related to nutrient cycling and adaptation of forests growing under nutrient poor or perturbed conditions. We suggest that the rhizosphere is not an ephemeral environment in the soil, but persists over time and is resilient against perturbation as evinced by consistent differences between rhizosphere and bulk chemistry and mineralogy over wide range of field treatments.},

Nitrogen fertilization increased extracellular phosphatase activity in all sites. Phosphorus additions consistently reduced phosphatase activity, mycorrhizal colonization, and P uptake capacity across sites. Our results indicate that these plants efficiently allocate resources to nutrient acquisition as suggested by an economic model. Investment in acquisition of a nutrient was greatest when that nutrient was limiting to growth, and plants appeared to allocate excess N to construction of extracellular phosphatases to acquire P. This increase in phosphatase production with N fertilization implies that even P-limited systems might respond to N deposition with greater productivity.},

The differences in $\delta$13C between CO2 and sporocarps were generally small, < ±1‰ in nine out of 16 species, and the average shift for all investigated species was 0.04‰. However, when fungal groups were analysed separately, three out of six species of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes respired 13C-enriched CO2 (up to 1.6‰), whereas three out of five species of polypores respired 13C-depleted CO2 (up to 1.7‰; P < 0.05). The CO2 and sporocarps were always 13C-enriched compared with wood, litter or roots. • Loss of 13C-depleted CO2 may have enriched some species in 13C.

Soil microbiomes were characterized by sequencing amplicons of selected molecular markers. Soil chemistry and plant mycorrhizal type were the two dominant factors explaining variations in bacterial and fungal diversity, respectively. The lowest altitude level had more favorable conditions for the formation of mull humus and exhibited higher N and Ca contents. These conditions were also associated with a higher proportion of Betaproteobacteria, Acidimicrobia, Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae. Low soil and forest floor quality as well as lower bacterial and fungal diversity characterized higher altitude levels, along with a high proportion of shared bacterial (Thermoleophilia, Actinobacteria and Bacilli) and fungal (Eurotiomycetes and Mortierellomycota) taxa. Beech-dominated sites showed moderate soil quality and high bacterial (Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes and Bacteroidetes) and fungal (Basidiomycota) diversity. Particularly, the Basidiomycota were well represented in pure beech forests at an altitude of 1500 m. In fertile and nitrogen rich soils with neutral pH, soil quality decreased along the altitudinal gradient, indicating that microbial diversity and forest floor decomposition were likely constrained by climatic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Author(s) 2020.

abstract = {Ja{\'{i}}ba Project is an irrigation enterprise and its forest reserve is one of the largest protected areas of dry deciduous forest of Caatinga. However, two accidental fires burned about 90% of the area, resulting on the elimination of the trees. This study intended to evaluate the effects of dual inoculation with Rhizobium and mycorrhizal fungi on growth of Anadenanthera peregrina and its contribution to intercropped native species (Myracrodruon urundeuva Fr. Allem., Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. and Acacia sp.) and to increase the soil nutrients through litter decomposition as a strategy for the restoration of the reserve. The plants of Anadenanthera peregrina which were inoculated with rhizobia strain BHICB-A10 and associated with AM, showed a significant increase in height and total nitrogen content over that uninoculated plants. In plots where A. peregrina was inoculated, growth and survival of intercropped plants as Myracrodruon urundeuva, were favoured. This result may be explained by the faster decomposition rate of M. urundeuva litter and by the increase of soil nutrients which was related with its lowest lignocellulous content. The mixture of A. peregrina with M. urundeuva was the best model for restoration.},

Species diversity and overall community structure were similar inside of and outside of RmTs, and no grouping was detected by substrate type. Differences within the ectomycorrhizal fungus community were associated only weakly with environmental parameters, as indicated by ordination. In light of these results, recent observations of ectomycorrhizal suppression and strong shifts in the proportions of morphotypes on tree seedlings inside of RmT do not appear to be related to differences in sporophore distributions.

While Eucalyptus marginata was the dominant tree species in the latter, four species of Eucalyptus, in even-aged stands ranging from 1 to 7 years old, had been planted on the former mine sites. Diversity and abundance of both types of fungi increased with stand age on the rehabilitated sites. In a 7-year-old stand, the number of va species, the abundance of their spores, and the percentage of roots colonized by them were comparable to their levels of activity in native forest. Numbers of species of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with 7-year-old stands were less than half of those associated with native forest, with only a few species being common to both habitats. This difference is probably indicative of the early phase of development of the rehabilitated sites. A clearly defined succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi was observed as the stands of trees increased in age, the changes being correlated with the development of a layer of leaf litter. There was a close relationship between the identities of fungi producing fruitbodies and being responsible for the formation of ectomycorrhizae. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

@article{Yang20141126,
abstract = {Potassium (K), an element required slightly lower than nitrogen (N), is one of the essential major nutrients for trees in forests. K deficiency inhibits tree growth and limits forest productivities. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are one of important microorganisms in forests. Many forest trees have evolved mutualistic symbioses with the fungi that contribute to their nutrition and growth. In the fungus-tree associations, the fungi obtain carbohydrates from host trees and, in turn, provide the plants with mineral nutrients such as phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and K. In our present experiment, ectomycorrhizal fungi isolated from pine and eucalyptus forests were grown in liquid culture media with various K supplies (26, 130, and 650 mg/ L K2 SO4) and with Ca2+ signal and anion channel inhibitors such as Trifluoperazine, TFP; Verapamil, VP; Ruthenium red, RR and Niflumic acid, NIF. The efflux of acetate and protons by the fungal isolates in the response to the K supplies and inhibitors were studied in vitro in order to understand the mechanisms of ectomycorrhizal fungi to improve the nutrition of host plants. The results indicated that the fungal species varied greatly in both growth and nutrient absorption (N, P and K). The hyphae biomass at harvest, for example, showed at least twice difference, ranging from 52.91 mg/ flask to 121.72 mg/ flask. The reasons for the variations in growth and nutrition could be explained by the biological adaption to soil nutrient environments where they lived for a long time through evolution and selection. Oxalate, acetate, malate, citrate, succinate and large amount of protons were detected in the culture solutions. Taking into the account of dissolution and decomposition of minerals and rocks caused by protons and organic acids, ectomycorrhizal fungi could thus make K in mineral structures available for the host plants. In addition, all study fungi released acetate into liquid culture media and the low K supply stimulated significantly the acetate efflux. The efflux rate correlated negatively with K concentration in culture solutions (r= - 0.734, n= 60) and fungal K absorption (r= - 0.617, n= 60). In forest soils, therefore, the influence of K on acetate efflux by the external hyphae of ectomycorrhizas could be physiologically and ecologically important for the improvement of tree K nutrition at low K supply but prevention against K leaching in fertile soils. The inhibitors of Ca signals and anion channels decreased the acetate efflux by ectomycorrhizal fungal isolates in culture solutions with low K supply. It seems reasonable to suggest both Ca signals and anion channels involved the process of the fungal acetate exudation in this case. The primary signal of K deficiencies could act as the intracellular second messenger to react on calmodulin (CaM), by which changed the Ca2+ distribution inside and outside of the hyphae cells, and then stimulated the cascade reactions responsible for acetate efflux, including gene expression, acetate synthesis and anion channel activation. Concerning the difference between the ectomycorrhizas in the field and the fungal isolates in vitro, further investigation is necessary to carry out on the mechanisms of the detail processes with ectomycorrhizal trees.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) deposition can enhance carbon (C) capture and storage in northern coniferous forests but it may also enhance the demand for phosphorus (P). While it is well established that long-term N enrichment can decrease decomposition and enhance the accumulation of C in soils, it remains uncertain if a higher demand and acquisition of P influence soil C. We studied microbial phosphorus mobilization and growth within a long-term N enrichment experiment in a Norway spruce forest, where N deposition was simulated by adding 0, 12.5 or 50 kg N ha−1 year−1 for 21 years (n = 12), by incubating microbial ingrowth cores with needles and humus with low and high P content, and with sand with and without mineral apatite P. Long-term N enrichment had no effect on microbial P mobilization in needles and humus and did not enhance the positive effect that apatite had on fungal growth. However, it consistently strengthened the retention of C in the soil by decreasing decomposition of needle and humus, both with low and high P content, and by increasing fungal growth in sand-filled ingrowth cores. Furthermore, we did not find any evidence that higher microbial P mobilization in response to N enrichment affected soil C storage. These results show that long-term N enrichment in relatively young soils dominated by coniferous trees and ectomycorrhizal fungi can have relatively small impact on microbial P mobilization from organic sources and on the potential to mobilize P from minerals, and subsequently that elevated P demand due to N enrichment is unlikely to lead to a reduction in the soil C accumulation rate.

abstract = {We analyzed the influence of above- and belowground factors on the soil microbial community in a Chinese subtropical forest, one of the most diverse biomes in the northern hemisphere. Soil samples were taken at different depths from four replicate comparative study plots in each of three forest age classes (young 10-40 years, medium 40-80 years, old ≥80 years). Microbial biomass and community structure were then determined using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, and basal respiration and microbial biomass carbon (C mic) were determined by substrate-induced respiration. These data were then related to plant community and soil variables using non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis and post-hoc permutational correlations. We found that microbial lipid composition and abundance were not related to forest age class. Instead, microbial lipid composition and abundance were related to factors reflecting primary production, i. e., percent litter cover, percent dead wood cover, and percent tree layer cover. Specifically, the relative abundance (mol fraction) of indicators for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were positively significantly correlated with percent litter cover. We also found that the biomass of all microbial groups and total PLFA were negatively significantly related to percent deadwood cover. In addition, pH H2O was the only soil parameter that was correlated significantly to microbial biomass. Our results indicate that overarching ecological factors such as plant productivity and soil pH are important factors influencing the soil microbial community, both in terms of biomass and of community composition in this subtropical ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Background & Aims: Oak seedling establishment is difficult and may be partly explained by litter-mediated interactions with neighbors. Litter effects can be physical or chemical and result in positive or negative feedback effects for seedlings. Mediterranean species leaves contain high levels of secondary metabolites which suggest that negative litter effects could be important. Methods: Seedlings of Quercus ilex and Quercus pubescens were grown for two years in pots with natural soil and litter inputs from 6 Mediterranean woody species, artificial litter (only physical effect) or bare soil. Results: Litter types had highly different mass loss (41–80%), which correlated with soil organic C, total N and microbial activity. Litter of Q. pubescens increased soil humidity and oak seedlings aerial biomass. Litters of Cotinus coggygria and Rosmarinus officinalis, containing high quantities of phenolics and terpenes respectively, decomposed fast and led to specific soil microbial catabolic profiles but did not influence oak seedling growth, chemistry or mycorrhization rates. Conclusions: Physical litter effects through improved soil humidity seem to be predominant for oak seedling development. Despite high litter phenolics content, we detected no chemical effects on oak seedlings. Litter traits conferring a higher ability to retain soil moisture in dry periods deserve further attention as they may be critical to explain plant-soil feedbacks in Mediterranean ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {<p> Plant–microbial interactions in the litter layer represent one of the most relevant interactions for biogeochemical cycling as litter decomposition is a key first step in carbon and nitrogen turnover. However, our understanding of these interactions in the litter layer remains elusive. In an old-growth mixed <italic>Nothofagus</italic> forest in Patagonia, we studied the effects of single tree species identity and the mixture of three tree species on the fungal and bacterial composition in the litter layer. We also evaluated the effects of nitrogen (N) addition on these plant–microbial interactions. In addition, we compared the magnitude of stimulation of litter decomposition due to home field advantage (HFA, decomposition occurs more rapidly when litter is placed beneath the plant species from which it had been derived than beneath a different plant species) and N addition that we previously demonstrated in this same forest, and used microbial information to interpret these results. Tree species identity had a strong and significant effect on the composition of fungal communities but not on the bacterial community of the litter layer. The microbial composition of the litter layer under the tree species mixture show an averaged contribution of each single tree species. N addition did not erase the plant species footprint on the fungal community, and neither altered the bacterial community. N addition stimulated litter decomposition as much as HFA for certain tree species, but the mechanisms behind N and HFA stimulation may have differed. Our results suggest that stimulation of decomposition from N addition might have occurred due to increased microbial activity without large changes in microbial community composition, while HFA may have resulted principally from plant species' effects on the litter fungal community. Together, our results suggest that plant–microbial interactions can be an unconsidered driver of litter decomposition in temperate forests. </p>},

We investigated fungal diversity and community composition seasonally and across defined soil horizons in boreal Scots pine forest in Finland using 454 pyrosequencing. We collected a total of 120 samples from five vertical soil horizons monthly from March to October; in March, under snow. Boreal forest soil generally harbored diverse fungal communities across soil horizons. The communities shifted drastically and rapidly over time. In late winter, saprotrophs dominated the community and were replaced by ectomycorrhizal fungi during the growing season. Our studies are among the first to dissect the spatial and temporal dynamics in boreal forest ecosystems and highlights the ecological importance of vertically distinct communities and their rapid seasonal dynamics. As climate change is predicted to result in warmer and longer snow-free winter seasons, as well as increase the rooting depth of trees in boreal forest, the seasonal and vertical distribution of fungal communities may change. These changes are likely to affect the organic matter decomposition by the soil-inhabiting fungi and thus alter organic C pools.},

Soil microorganisms play a central role as mediators of these interactions, but mechanistic understanding is still largely lacking. Correlative data from a coniferous forest ecosystem support the hypothesis that interactions between fungal guilds play a central role in regulating organic matter accumulation in relation to fertility. With increasing ecosystem fertility, the proportion of saprotrophic basidiomycetes increased in deeper organic layers, at the expense of ectomycorrhizal fungal species. Saprotrophs correlated positively with the activity of oxidative enzymes, which in turn favoured organic matter turnover and nitrogen recycling to plants. Combined, our findings are consistent with a fungus-mediated feedback loop, which results in a negative correlation between ecosystem fertility and below-ground carbon storage. These findings call for a shift in focus from plant litter traits to fungal traits in explaining organic matter dynamics and ecosystem fertility in boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS},

abstract = {Habitat heterogeneity is an important driver of aboveground species diversity but few studies have investigated effects on soil communities. Trees shape their surrounding by both leaf litter and roots generating small scale heterogeneity and potentially governing community patterns of soil organisms. To assess the role of vegetation for the soil fauna, we studied whether tree species (Fagus sylvatica L., Acer pseudoplatanus L., Fraxinus excelsior L., Tilia cordata Mill.), markedly differing in leaf litter quality and root associated mycorrhizal symbionts, affect oribatid mite communities by shaping below- and aboveground resources and habitat complexity and availability. Oribatid mite abundance, species richness, community structure and the proportion of litter living and parthenogenetic individuals were analyzed and related to microbial biomass and the amount of remaining litter mass. Although leaf litter species with higher nutritional values decomposed considerably faster, microbial biomass only slightly differed between leaf litter species. Neither root species nor leaf litter species affected abundance, species richness or community structure of oribatid mites. However, root species had an effect on the proportion of parthenogenetic individuals with increased proportions in the presence of beech roots. Overall, the results suggest that identity and diversity of vegetation via leaf litter or roots are of minor importance for structuring oribatid mite communities of a temperate forest ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2019 Bluhm et al.

abstract = {Forest soils store large amounts of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), yet how predicted shifts in forest composition will impact long-term C and N persistence remains poorly understood. A recent hypothesis predicts that soils under trees associated with arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) store less C than soils dominated by trees associated with ectomycorrhizas (ECM), due to slower decomposition in ECM-dominated forests. However, an incipient hypothesis predicts that systems with rapid decomposition—e.g. most AM-dominated forests—enhance soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization by accelerating the production of microbial residues. To address these contrasting predictions, we quantified soil C and N to 1 m depth across gradients of ECM-dominance in three temperate forests. By focusing on sites where AM- and ECM-plants co-occur, our analysis controls for climatic factors that covary with mycorrhizal dominance across broad scales. We found that while ECM stands contain more SOM in topsoil, AM stands contain more SOM when subsoil to 1 m depth is included. Biomarkers and soil fractionations reveal that these patterns are driven by an accumulation of microbial residues in AM-dominated soils. Collectively, our results support emerging theory on SOM formation, demonstrate the importance of subsurface soils in mediating plant effects on soil C and N, and indicate that shifts in the mycorrhizal composition of temperate forests may alter the stabilization of SOM. {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Here I define ecosystem function, using the largely plant-based functions of aboveground productivity and decomposition of 10 common early successional trees found in Puerto Rico, and then use two different multivariate techniques to define functional groups. I found that: (1) multivariate statistical methods worked well to sort out the test species on axes defined primarily by productivity, which may have more redundancy than decomposition, and initial leaf nutrient content, (2) there were four plant functional groups defined by species (i) Psychotria berteriana, (ii) Cecropia schreberiana, (iii) Inga vera, and (iv) a group containing the other seven species, and (3) the plant traits of nitrogen-fixing capacity and mycorrhizal strategy mapped better onto these groups then those of seed size, wood density, shade tolerance or successional status.

This negative correlation may have been caused by an alteration in food supply of enchytraeids, owing to changes in litter quality and the amount and species composition of fungi and mycorrhizae. Nematode numbers showed a positive correlation with the activity of dehydrogenase enzymes mineral N, and soil pH. The feeding characteristics of nematodes as a group need further study.

The communities under consideration differ significantly from each other in the species composition of symbiotrophs. 20 species are in common with them. Ectomycorrhiza-formers are subdivided into two groups. The first one contains the fungi of early stage of root system colonization. These are the species of Hebeloma, Inocybe, Laccaria, and Paxillus genera. The second group includes the mushrooms of the late stage. The representatives of Boletus, Lactarius, Leccinum, and Russula genera and others belong to them. In the birch forests 59 species of xylotrophs have been identified. The obligate parasites developing only on the living trees are represented by Inonotus obliquus f. sterilis and Polyporus umbellatus, facultative saprotrophs - by eight species, facultative parasites - by ten, saprotrophs - by 39 ones. In the study area only 3 from 59 species of wood-destroying fungi are solely associated with birch wood. 6 species prefer birch wood but they also may be found on other trees. The remaining species of xylotrophs also occur in other deciduous species and do not favor the species in question. In addition, 4 species with a very broad ecological valence concerning the feeding substrate are registered in the birch forests, these species occurring not only in deciduous, but also in coniferous species. Litter and humus saprotrophs are represented in birch forests by 23 species. All of them are widely distributed in other types of forests, and among them species specific for birch forests are absent. In the bogged birch forests the ground cover is formed by sphagnum mosses. Fungi belonging to the trophic group of bryotrophs which are represented in these conditions by nine species develop among them. The use of birch in protective forest planting and its active expansion on derelict agricultural land resulted in significant changes of the number of agaricomycetes individual species and the structure of edible mushrooms resources. {\textcopyright} 2019, Russian Academy of Sciences.

The anthropogenic impact is minimal in the study area. Effects of environmental warming were addressed as changes in treeline and forest communities (greening of the vegetation). With warming, permafrost is beginning to thaw, and as it thaws, it decomposes. Therefore, we also included depth of soil thawing and litter decomposition in our study. Particular attention was paid to the reaction of aphyllophoroid fungal communities concerning these factors. Our results provide evidence for drastic changes in the mycobiota due to global warming. Fungal community composition followed changes of the vegetation, which was transforming from forest-tundra to northern boreal type forests during the last 60 years. Key fungal groups of the ongoing borealization and important indicator species are discussed. Increased economic activity in the area may lead to deforestation, destruction of swamps, and meadows. However, this special environment provides important services such as carbon sequestration, soil formation, protecting against flood risks, and filtering of air.

abstract = {Fungal symbioses with plants are ubiquitous, ancient, and vital to both ecosystem function and plant health. However, benefits to fungal symbionts are not well explored, especially in non-mycorrhizal fungi. The Foraging Ascomycete hypothesis proposes that some wood-decomposing fungi may shift life-history strategies to endophytism to bridge gaps in time and space between suitable substrates. To test this hypothesis we examine spatial relationships of Xylaria endophytic fungi in the forest canopy with Xylaria decomposer fungi on the forest floor. We sampled for fungi of the genus Xylaria using a spatially explicit sampling scheme in a remote Ecuadorian cloud forest, and concurrently carried out an extensive culture-based sampling of fungal foliar endophytes. We found 36 species of Xylaria in our 0.5 ha plot, 31 of which were found to only occur as fruiting bodies. All five species of Xylaria found as endophytes were also found as fruiting bodies. We also tested the relationships of both stages of these fungi to environmental variables. Decomposer fungi were differentiated by species-specific habitat preferences, with three species being found closer to water than expected by chance. In contrast, endophytes displayed no sensitivity to environmental conditions, such as host, moisture, or canopy cover. We found evidence of spatial linkage between life stages in two species. We also demonstrate that direct transmission of endophytes from leaves to woody substrates is possible. These results indicate that endophytism may represent one way for decomposer fungi to escape moisture limitation, and that endophytic fungi may act as sources of dispersal for decomposer fungi consistent with predictions of the Foraging Ascomycete hypothesis. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract = {The species composition of macrofungal communities in 12 stands of planted Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karsten.) across lowland England was assessed over three consecutive years, and related to stand structure and site characteristics. Results indicate that these plantations provide a habitat for diverse communities of macrofungi: a total of 343 species were recorded, of which 171 were found to be unique to pine, and 90 unique to spruce. The composition of these communities was found to differ markedly between forest areas and between plots within individual forests, with only three species common to all assessment plots. Calculation of Jaccard similarity coefficients indicated a 22-24% association between chronosequence stages in the two pine sites, and 20% in the two spruce sites. Fungi were classified into four functional groups based on their mode of nutrition: wood saprotrophs, litter saprotrophs, mycorrhizal and parasitic species. This enabled patterns of diversity to be related to stand structure and a range of site factors (based on soil chemical analyses). Positive relationships were recorded between increased volume of deadwood and the number of species of wood saprotrophs, and also between the species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi and the number of tree species present in each plot. Significant correlations were also recorded between the number of parasitic fungal species and soil pH (a positive response to increasing alkalinity), and between the number of litter colonizing saprotrophs and tree species richness. These results suggest that indicators of macrofungal diversity, based on relatively simple habitat assessments, could be developed for incorporation into forest management plans. These data also highlight the importance of maintaining adequate volumes of deadwood, and variety of tree species, permitting the development of diverse communities of macrofungi in forest stands.

A layer of pine or oak litter was placed on the surface of the nursery bed soil to mimic natural litter cover. Oak litter amendment appeared to be most favorable for seedling survival, with a 73% survival rate, in contrast to the untreated mineral bed soil (44%). The concentrations of total N, P, K, Ca, and Mg were higher in oak growth medium than in pine growth medium. Relative to the control (pH 6.1), the pH was lower in pine growth medium (5.8) and higher in oak growth medium (6.3). There were also twofold and threefold increases in the C content of growth medium with the addition of pine and oak litter, respectively. Among seven mycorrhizal morphotypes, eight different mycorrhizal taxa were identified: Suillus luteus, Suillus variegatus, Wilcoxina mikolae, a Tuber sp., a Tomentella sp., Cenococcum geophilum, Amphinema byssoides, and one unidentified ectomycorrhizal symbiont. Forest litter addition affected the relative abundance of mycorrhizal symbionts more than their overall representation. This was more pronounced for pine litter than for oak litter, with 40% and 25% increases in the abundance of suilloid mycorrhizae, respectively. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that changes in the supply of organic matter through litter manipulation may have far-reaching effects on the chemistry of soil, thus influencing the growth and survival of Scots pine seedlings and their mycorrhizal communities.

abstract = {Roots of most terrestrial plants form symbiotic associations with fungi. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are widespread and abundant. They are formed by bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms and are ubiquitous in most temperate and tropical ecosystems including agricultural systems. Ectomycorrhizas occur in certain families of woody gymnosperms and angiosperms and are extremely important in many temperate and boreal forests. The plant order Ericales contains a natural group of closely related families with worldwide distribution. Except for orchid and monotropoid associations, mycorrhizas involve plant exchange of photosynthates in return for a fungal exchange of mineral nutrients. The convergence of so many unrelated forms of mycorrhizas is a testament for the mutual benefits of these trading partnerships. Mycorrhizal interactions influence the species composition, diversity, and stability of biotic communities. Mycorrhizal fungi co-inhabit the rhizosphere with many saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi. One of the most important functions of mycorrhizas is their role in physically structuring soils. The total effect of roots and associated mycorrhizal fungi on soil structure is related to their turnover and decomposition rates. Aerts suggested that variation in access to different nutrient pools among various types of mycorrhizal fungi leads to positive feedback between the dominant plants in an ecosystem and litter decomposition. The average global temperature has risen since the early 1980s, and it has been predicted that the land surface temperature will increase by 3.1° C by 2085. The analytical challenge of holistic studies of complex interactions among communities of rhizosphere organisms and the environment is daunting. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

They are proposed to promote organic matter accumulation by suppressing saprotrophs, but have also been suggested to play an active role in decomposition themselves. Here we show that exclusion of tree roots and associated ectomycorrhizal fungi in a boreal forest increased decomposition of surface litter by 11% by alleviating nitrogen limitation of saprotrophs–a “Gadgil effect”. At the same time, root exclusion decreased Mn-peroxidase activity in the deeper mor layer by 91%. Our results show that ectomycorrhizal fungi may hamper short-term litter decomposition, but also support a crucial role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in driving long-term organic matter oxidation. These observations stress the importance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in regulation of below-ground organic matter accumulation. By different mechanisms they may either hamper or stimulate decomposition, depending upon stage of decomposition and location in the soil profile.},

Here, we provide the current state of knowledge suggesting future research directions regarding (i) stand structure attributes (age, tree cover, stand density, tree species composition), (ii) management history (managed vs unmanaged), (iii) silvicultural treatments (thinning, clearcutting, shelterwood methods, selective cutting) and (iv) other anthropogenic disturbances (mushroom picking, salvage logging, prescribed burning, fertilization) affecting fungal diversity and community composition. The reviewed studies reported a positive correlation between fungal diversity and stand structure variables such as canopy cover, basal area of the stand and tree species diversity, particularly for mycorrhizal species. Abundance and diversity in size, tree species and decomposition stage of deadwood are reported as positively related to richness of wood-inhabiting fungi. The main findings about the effects of silvicultural practices suggest that the higher is the management intensity the lower is the diversity of ectomycorrhizal and wood-inhabiting species, at least in the short term. We have therefore reported those silvicultural practices which may reduce trade-offs between timber harvesting and fungal diversity conservation. Indeed, fungal diversity can be conserved in managed forests if (i) low impact logging operations are performed; (ii) stand structural complexity and late-successional forest characteristics are enhanced; (iii) deadwood amount and diversity is promoted, (iv) landscape heterogeneity and connectivity is improved or maintained. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Temperate ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi show segregation whereby some species dominate in organic layers and others favor mineral soils. Weak layering in tropical soils is hypothesized to decrease niche space and therefore reduce the diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The Neotropical ECM tree Dicymbe corymbosa forms monodominant stands and has a distinct physiognomy with vertical crown development, adventitious roots and massive root mounds, leading to multi-stemmed trees with spatially segregated rooting environments: aerial litter caches, aerial decayed wood, organic root mounds and mineral soil. We hypothesized that these microhabitats host distinct fungal assemblages and therefore promote diversity. To test our hypothesis, we sampled D. corymbosa ectomycorrhizal root tips from the four microhabitats and analyzed community composition based on pyrosequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) barcode markers. Several dominant fungi were ubiquitous but analyses nonetheless suggested that communities in mineral soil samples were statistically distinct from communities in organic microhabitats. These data indicate that distinctive rooting zones of D. corymbosa contribute to spatial segregation of the fungal community and likely enhance fungal diversity. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {Objective: Pinus armandii distributes widely in the Erlang Mountain and is one of the dominant species in the community. The Erlang Mountain Forest Farm is located in Sichuan Province and it contains rich microbial resources. This article was intended to study the fungal diversity and analyze the relationship between fungal structure and their functions at the beginning of the P. armandii litter decomposition period. Method: The grinding method was used in this paper to isolate fungi on the P. armandii litter from the altitude of 2 750, 2 650, 2 510, and 2 460 m. The isolates were further indentified according to the morphology combined with PCR amplification and sequencing using the universal primers based on the ITS sequence of fungi. In addition, the Rhizosphaera was for the first time isolated from P. armandii, and the relevant research on the fungi is still insufficient. There remains controversy on the fungal role as a pathogen or weak parasitic fungus in foreign reports. The fungus was reported to cause disease on P. sylvestris var. mongolica in China in 2013. In this study, 12 strains of Rhizosphaera were isolated from the four elevations. To study the saprophytic performance, three strains of Rhizosphaera sp. with different morphological features, namely R. sp.1, R. sp.2 and R. sp.3, and one strain of Lophodermium erlangshanense were selected for decomposition test in vitro, in which the P. armandii litter is the sole substrate. Result: The isolation results showed that 23 fungi taxa were obtained. The imperfecti and ascomycetes were the major components that occupy 15 taxa and 5 taxa, respectively. All of the fungi belonged to 15 genera. Mucor, Trichoderma, Rhizosphaera, Penicillium and Talaromyces were isolated from the plots over the four different elevations, and were the abundant species. The filamentous fungi, such as Trichoderma, and Penicillium, which had the quantitative superiority and diversity, undoubtedly would play an important role in the process of litter decomposition. However, basidiomycete fungi, without abundant amount and species, might not participate in the decomposition at the early stage. The basidiomycete fungi originated from the environment may participate in the further lignin decomposition at the late stage. Through the determination of cellulose enzyme produced by the fungi, the activities of endoglucanase and $\beta$-glucosidase reach the maximum at the 13th day. The activities of Cellobiohydrolase reach the maximum at the 17th day. In general, there was no significant difference in the enzyme activities as well as the mass loss among the four strains. Those results indicated that Rhizosphaera sp. and L. erlangshanense could decompose the cellulose components, and there was a synergistic effect from the different cellulase enzymes (endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase, $\beta$-glucosidase). The mass loss decomposed by L. erlangshanense was 15.74%, while the loss caused by Rhizosphaera sp. ranged from 12.00% to 13.40%. According to the previous researches, L. erlangshanense was usually found in the litter and rarely in alive needles, suggesting that it may not cause the needle disease. Conclusion: The results indicated that filamentous fungi, such as Trichoderma, and Penicillium, played an important role at the beginning of the litter decomposition period. They were both the dominant species in the four different altitudes. Rhizosphaera sp. and L. erlangshanense were weak saprotrophic fungi in the P. armandii litter. However, it needs to be further verified that whether the capacity of cellulose decomposing enzyme is related to their pathogenicity. {\textcopyright} 2016, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

abstract = {The release of carbon as CO2 from belowground processes accounts for about 70% of total ecosystem respiration. Insights about factors controlling soil CO2 efflux are constrained by the challenge of apportioning sources of CO2 between autotrophic tree roots (and mycorrhizal fungi) and heterotrophic microorganisms. In some temperate conifer forests, the reduction in soil CO2 efflux after girdling (phloem removal) has been used to separate these sources. Girdling stops the flow of carbohydrates to the belowground portion of the ecosystem, which should slow respiration by roots and mycorrhizae while heterotrophic respiration should remain constant or be enhanced by the decomposition of newly dead roots. Therefore, the reduction in CO2 efflux after girdling should be a conservative estimate of the belowground flux of C from trees. We tested this approach in two tropical Eucalyptus plantations. Tree canopies remained intact for more than 3 months after girdling, showing no reduction in light interception. The reduction in soil CO2 efflux averaged 16-24% for the 3-month period after girdling. The reduction in CO2 efflux was similar for plots with one half of the trees girdled and those with all of the trees girdled. Girdling did not reduce live fine root biomass for at least 5 months after treatment, indicating that large reserves of carbohydrates in the root systems of Eucalyptus trees maintained the roots and root respiration. Our results suggest that the girdling approach is unlikely to provide useful insights into the contribution of tree roots and heterotrophs to soil CO 2 efflux in this type of forest ecosystem. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract = {The decomposition of soil organic matter in forest ecosystems is important in two ways. First, soil organic matter is the largest pool of C in terrestrial ecosystems, so understanding global carbon cycling requires an appreciation of the factors that control the size of that pool and the fluxes through it. Among these factors are those that control the rate of organic matter decomposition. Second, organic matter decomposition is the major process controlling the supply of nutrients to plants. In some ecosystems ectomycorrhizal fungi comprise a surprisingly large fraction of soil organic matter. However, little is known of the rates of decomposition of ectomycorrhizal fungi, or of the factors that control those rates. Therefore, we set out to examine the relationship between N concentrations and decomposition rates of ectomycorrhizal fungi using a wide variety of strains isolated from a Pinus resinosa plantation. We found that substantial variation among strains existed in decomposition rate, and that decomposition rate was highly correlated with tissue N concentration. We conclude, therefore, that the structures of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities may be ecologically important in terms of ecosystem C and N dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.},

abstract = {We investigated how habitat characteristics and in particular the level of disturbance was affecting colonisation processes and population dynamics of an ectomycorrhizal fungus. The basidiomycete Hebetoma cylindrosporum associated with Pinus pinaster trees occurs in two distinct habitats within the forest dune ecosystem along the Atlantic coast of France. The 'dune habitat' (D habitat) is characterised by scattered trees growing in almost pure sand at the extreme fringe of the forest marking the transition with the bare dune. The 'forest habitat' (F habitat) is within the mature forest in places of high human frequentation which prevents litter and humus accumulation. We studied over several years (up to ten) populations of H. cylindrosporum present in three geographic sites. Within each site we studied two areas corresponding each to one of the two possible habitats. In all sampled areas fruit bodies occurred within discrete patches of ground. Although an interaction between habitat and geographic site existed, habitat had significant effects on patch sizes and patch internal densities. Compared to the F habitat, patches in the D habitat were significantly larger and presented a lower density of fruit bodies. Patches very seldom occurred at the same place from one year to the next in the F habitat when in most cases they were perennial and increased in size in the D habitat. Fruit body size, which reflects reproductive output of the genets, differed between the two habitats (means of the cap diameters of 25.6 and 40.4 mm in respectively the F and D habitats). Almost all patches in the F habitat were made of several annual genets each producing on average 1.6 fruit bodies while most patches in the D habitat were dominated by one perennial genet which could simultaneously produce up to 60 fruit bodies. Under-representation of small sized genets in the D habitat suggests a low level of sexual recruitment in this habitat despite the large number of fruit bodies (and therefore of spores) produced by each of the existing genets. We therefore suggest that H. cylindrosporum could be considered as a fugitive species. Genets of this species survive in the D habitat in which few ectomycorrhizal fungal competitors occur. This habitat could represent the optimal habitat for this species. In the F habitat frequent recruitment could occur in 'empty patches' resulting from the local and transient elimination of competitors induced by human disturbance.},

abstract = {The number of fruiting bodies of ectomycorrhizal species in pine forests in The Netherlands has decreased dramatically in recent decades. This decrease has been attributed to an increase in nitrogen deposition and the accumulation of litter and humus. The effects of sod cutting and the removal of litter and humus, to restore ectomycorrhizal diversity in a Scots pine forest in Dwingeloo, The Netherlands, were investigated previously from 1990 to 1993. Removal of the litter and humus resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of species and fruiting bodies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, until now all data were obtained by counting fruiting bodies and the effects on mycelial development below ground were not assessed. To investigate hyphal development, DNA was extracted from bulk soil and polymerase chain reaction products were obtained by amplification using basidiomycete-specific internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers. The differences in diversity between the control plots and the treated plots were analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. To assess the species composition and differences, ITS regions of the amplified fragments were cloned and sequenced. Sequences were compared with sequences from GenBank and from fruiting bodies collected from the same plots. Data indicated increased below-ground ectomycorrhizal diversity in the plots that had been subjected to removal of the litter and humus layers. {\textcopyright} 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

abstract = {Phenology-induced changes in carbon assimilation by trees may affect carbon stored in fine roots and as a consequence, alter carbon allocated to ectomycorrhizal fungi. Two competing models exist to explain carbon mobilization by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Under the ‘saprotrophy model', decreased allocation of carbon may induce saprotrophic behaviour in ectomycorrhizal fungi, resulting in the decomposition of organic matter to mobilize carbon. Alternatively, under the ‘nutrient acquisition model', decomposition may instead be driven by the acquisition of nutrients locked within soil organic matter compounds, with carbon mobilization a secondary process. We tested whether phenology-induced shifts in carbon reserves of fine roots of aspen (Populus tremuloides) affect potential activity of four carbon-compound degrading enzymes, $\beta$-glucuronidase, $\beta$-glucosidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase and laccase, by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Ectomycorrhizal roots from mature aspen were collected across eight stands in north-eastern Alberta, Canada, and analysed during tree dormancy, leaf flush, full leaf expansion and leaf abscission. We predicted potential extracellular enzyme activity to be highest when root carbon reserves were lowest, should host phenology induce saprotrophism. Further, we anticipated enzyme activity to be mediated by invertase, a plant-derived enzyme which makes carbon available to fungal symbionts in the plant–fungus interface. Root carbon reserves were positively correlated with invertase, suggesting phenology may affect carbon allocation to ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, of the four enzymes, host phenology had the largest effect on $\beta$-glucuronidase, but activity of this enzyme was not correlated with root carbon reserves or invertase. Low-biomass ectomycorrhizas had greater potential laccase activity than high-biomass ectomycorrhizas, highlighting discrete functional traits in fungi for litter decomposition. Our results suggest that the decomposition of organic matter may be driven by foraging by fungi for nutrients locked within organic compounds rather than for mobilizing carbon. Furthermore, the potential ability to degrade lignin was more common in low-biomass ectomycorrhizas when compared to high-biomass ectomycorrhizas.

abstract = {Are mature forests carbon limited? To explore this question, we exposed
ca. 110-year-old, 40-m tall Picea abies trees to a 550-ppm CO2
concentration in a mixed lowland forest in NW Switzerland. The site
receives substantial soluble nitrogen (N) via atmospheric deposition,
and thus, trees are unlikely N-limited. We used a construction crane to
operate the free-air CO2 release system and for canopy access. Here, we
summarize the major results for growth and carbon (C) fluxes. Tissue
C-13 signals confirmed the effectiveness of the CO2 enrichment system
and permitted tracing the continuous flow of new C in trees. Tree
responses were individually standardized by pre-treatment signals. Over
the five experimental years, needles retained their photosynthetic
capacity and absorbed up to 37\% more CO2 under elevated (E) compared to
ambient (A) conditions. However, we did not detect an effect on stem
radial growth, branch apical growth and needle litter production.
Neither stem nor soil CO2 efflux was stimulated under elevated CO2. The
rate at which fine roots filled soil ingrowth cores did not
significantly differ between A- and E-trees. Since trees showed no
stomatal responses to elevated CO2, sap flow remained unresponsive, both
in the long run as well as during short-term CO2 on-off experiments. As
a consequence, soil moisture remained unaffected. We trapped
significantly more nitrate in the root sphere of E-trees suggesting a
CO2-stimulated breakdown of soil organic matter, presumably induced by
extra carbohydrate exudation (priming').Synthesis. The lack of a single
enhanced C sink to match the increased C uptake meant a missing C sink.
Increased C transport to below-ground sinks was indicated by C transfer
to ectomycorrhiza and on to neighbouring trees and by increased C export
to soil. We conclude that these tall Picea abies trees are not C limited
at current CO2 concentrations and further atmospheric CO2 enrichment
will have at most subtle effects on growth, despite enhanced N
availability.},

Previous studies demonstrating the potential of atmospheric N deposition to influence forest soil carbon have focused on decomposition processes with much less known about potential impacts on mycorrhiza-derived carbon. Glomalin is a unique glycoprotein produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi that has been implicated in the formation of soil aggregates and potentially a significant store of soil carbon. To determine the possible impact of experimental N deposition of such stores we examined the operationally defined glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) levels over two growing seasons in three forest types receiving background N deposition (control) or treated with 80 kg N ha-1 year-1 as NaNO 3. Three sites of each of three forest types, sugar maple-basswood (SMBW), sugar maple-red oak (SMRO), and black oak-white oak (BOWO), in northern Lower Michigan were studied during the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons. GRSP were extracted from air-dried soils with citric acid and measured by the Bradford method. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences related to forest type and sample date in easily extractable Bradford reactive (EE-BRSP) and Bradford-reactive soil protein (BRSP), but failed to detect significant effects of experimental N amendment. EE-BRSP and BRSP varied in a pattern that was consistent with an AM fungal origin; a pattern that reflected the mycorrhizal types of the dominant over and understory plants of each forest ecosystem. SMBW forests dominated by AM plants had the highest levels of protein. BOWO forests with low AM plant cover had the lowest protein levels and SMRO forests were intermediate. Both Bradford-reactive fractions and their ratio varied seasonally, generally being highest in fall samples. Significant correlations observed between BRSP fractions, phosphorous, and soil organic matter were likely related to covariation of soil properties across forest types. While not statistically significant, response patterns of BRSP to N deposition were ecosystem-specific and reflected mycorrhizal types of dominant species. Abundance of these proteins reflected previously observed changes in SOC in the two forest types examined with abundant AM hosts. Specifically, nitrate addition led to BRSP decreases in SMBW and increases in SMRO forests. Changes in BRSP accounted for a small fraction of the changes in SOC; appearing to increase as a fraction of residual SOC consistent with the idea that GRSP are recalcitrant. BRSP remained unchanged at BOWO sites despite a significant increase in SOC at these sites. Our results point to the potential of proteins as contributors to differential, mycorrhizal type-specific responses to changes in soil carbon following N amendment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Fine root production and turnover were studied in hardwood and coniferous taiga forests using three methods. (1) Using soil cores, fine root production ranged from 1574 ± 76 kg {\textperiodcentered} ha-1 {\textperiodcentered} year-1 in the upland white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) stand to 4386 ± 322 kg {\textperiodcentered} ha-1 {\textperiodcentered} year-1 in the floodplain balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.) stand, accounting for 49% of total production for coniferous stands anti 32% of total production for deciduous stands. Fine root turnover rates were higher in floodplain (0.90 ± 0.06 year-1) stands than in upland (0.42 ± 0.10 year-1) stands. Across all sites, the ratio of fine root turnover to litter fall averaged 2.2 for biomass and 2.8 for N. Both values were higher in floodplain stands than in upland stands, and in coniferous stands than in deciduous stands. (2) The C budget method showed that C allocation to fine roots varied from 150 to 425 g C {\textperiodcentered} m-2 {\textperiodcentered} year-1 and suggested that soil respiration was more dependent on C derived from reels than from aboveground inputs. The C allocation ratio (C to roots: C to litter fall) was inversely correlated with litter-fall C and varied from 0.3 to 69.5; there was a tendency for higher proportional belowground allocation in coniferous stands than in deciduous stands and the highest levels were at the earliest successional sites. (3) Estimates of apparent N uptake (N(u)), N allocation to fine roots, and fine root production based on N budget calculations showed that annual aboveground N increments exceeded N(u) estimates at half the sites, indicating that the method failed to account for large amounts of N acquired by plants. This suggests that plant and (or) mycorrhizal uptake of soil organic N may be more significant to ecosystem N cycling than mineral N turnover by the soil microbial biomass.},

abstract = {Decomposition is a key component of the global carbon (C) cycle, yet current ecosystem C models do not adequately represent the contributions of plant roots and their mycorrhizae to this process. The understanding of decomposition dynamics and their control by traits is particularly limited for the most distal first-order roots. Here we followed decomposition of first-order roots and leaf litter from 35 woody plant species differing in mycorrhizal type over 6 years in a Chinese temperate forest. First-order roots decomposed more slowly (k = 0.11 ± 0.01 years−1) than did leaf litter (0.35 ± 0.02 years−1), losing only 35% of initial mass on average after 6 years of exposure in the field. In contrast to leaf litter, nonlignin root C chemistry (nonstructural carbohydrates, polyphenols) accounted for 82% of the large interspecific variation in first-order root decomposition. Leaf litter from ectomycorrhizal (EM) species decomposed more slowly than that from arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) species, whereas first-order roots of EM species switched, after 2 years, from having slower to faster decomposition compared with those from AM species. The fundamentally different dynamics and control mechanisms of first-order root decomposition compared with those of leaf litter challenge current ecosystem C models, the recently suggested dichotomy between EM and AM plants, and the idea that common traits can predict decomposition across roots and leaves. Aspects of C chemistry unrelated to lignin or nitrogen, and not presently considered in decomposition models, controlled first-order root decomposition; thus, current paradigms of ecosystem C dynamics and model pa-rameterization require revision. {\textcopyright} 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

abstract = {Improved understanding of the nutritional ecology of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is important in understanding how tropical forests maintain high productivity on low-fertility soils. Relatively little is known about how AM fungi will respond to changes in nutrient inputs in tropical forests, which hampers our ability to assess how forest productivity will be influenced by anthropogenic change. Here we assessed the influence of long-term inorganic and organic nutrient additions and nutrient depletion on AM fungi, using two adjacent experiments in a lowland tropical forest in Panama. We characterised AM fungal communities in soil and roots using 454-pyrosequencing, and quantified AM fungal abundance using microscopy and a lipid biomarker. Phosphorus and nitrogen addition reduced the abundance of AM fungi to a similar extent, but affected community composition in different ways. Nutrient depletion (removal of leaf litter) had a pronounced effect on AM fungal community composition, affecting nearly as many OTUs as phosphorus addition. The addition of nutrients in organic form (leaf litter) had little effect on any AM fungal parameter. Soil AM fungal communities responded more strongly to changes in nutrient availability than communities in roots. This suggests that the ‘dual niches' of AM fungi in soil versus roots are structured to different degrees by abiotic environmental filters, and biotic filters imposed by the plant host. Our findings indicate that AM fungal communities are fine-tuned to nutrient regimes, and support future studies aiming to link AM fungal community dynamics with ecosystem function. {\textcopyright} 2018, International Society for Microbial Ecology.},

abstract = {Saprotrophic fungi are the dominant producers of organic matter-degrading extracellular enzymes in forest soils, but the extent to which they drive spatio-temporal variation in enzyme activities is unclear. We quantified the relationships between saprotrophic fungal biomass and enzyme activities in a mature temperate hardwood forest by placing soil-filled ingrowth bags inside trenches. Trenches were located in replicate stands (n = 7) dominated by either arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)- or ectomycorrhizal (ECM)-associated tree species, which reflect differences in soil substrate quality and nutrient availability. Additionally, we assessed the extent to which the relationships between saprotrophic fungal biomass and enzyme activities varied across seasons and were altered by experimental nitrogen (N) addition. Overall, both fungal production and enzyme activities differed between mycorrhizal types and across seasons, but were unaffected by N addition. Additionally, enzyme activities exhibited strong, positive relationships with saprotrophic fungal biomass. However, the relative production of carbon (C)-degrading enzymes was greater in stands dominated by AM-associated trees in the late growing season, and the relative production of N-degrading enzymes was greater in the late growing season across both AM- and ECM-dominated forest stands. These patterns reflected tree- and season-driven changes in microbial C and N limitation. As such, while the common assumption that microbial biomass and enzyme activities are positively correlated is robust for saprotrophic fungi, enzyme produced per unit biomass may not be consistent among stands and across seasons. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Bark beetle outbreaks are widespread in western North American forests, reducing primary productivity and transpiration, leading to forest mortality across large areas and altering ecosystem carbon cycling. Here the carbon isotope composition ($\delta$13C) of soil respiration ($\delta$J) was monitored in the decade after disturbance for forests affected naturally by mountain pine beetle infestation and artificially by stem girdling. The seasonal mean $\delta$J changed along both chronosequences. We found (a) enrichment of $\delta$J relative to controls (<1 ‰) in near-surface soils in the first 2 years after disturbance; (b) depletion (1‰ or no change) during years 3–7; and (c) a second period of enrichment (1–2‰) in years 8–10. Results were consistent with isotopic patterns associated with the gradual death and decomposition of rhizosphere organisms, fine roots, conifer needles and woody roots and debris over the course of a decade after mortality. Finally, $\delta$J was progressively more 13C-depleted deeper in the soil than near the surface, while the bulk soil followed the well-established pattern of 13C-enrichment at depth. Overall, differences in $\delta$J between mortality classes (<1‰) and soil depths (<3‰) were smaller than variability within a class or depth over a season (up to 6‰). {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

abstract = {Upland oak forests in the ecotone between the eastern deciduous forest and the southern Great Plains are threatened by encroachment of eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) due to fire suppression. The rapid rate of encroachment caused concern about concomitant alterations of site characteristics including nutrient cycling and the soil microbial communities (SMC) that could lead to positive feedbacks reinforcing eastern redcedar encroachment. We studied eight upland oak forests across central and western Oklahoma with stands representing three levels of encroachment: oak-dominated, eastern redcedar-dominated, and an intermediate mixture of both species. We analyzed litter chemistry (carbon, lignin, and nitrogen), soil chemistry (soil organic matter, NH4N, NO3-N, PO4, K, and pH), and profiled soil microbial communities using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA). Eastern redcedar encroachment was accompanied by reduced litter carbon along with higher levels of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi while litter N was lower in mixed stands. However, we detected no change in soil chemistry. Our results indicate eastern redcedar encroachment in these upland oak forests reduced litter quality and altered the SMC through increases in AM fungi, a symbiont associated with eastern redcedar. These alterations may create positive soil-microbial feedbacks by reducing the fitness of the dominant oak species and facilitating rapid increase in eastern redcedar in this threatened, oak-dominated ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Forest management practices often severely affect forest ecosystem functioning. Tree removal by clearcutting is one such practice, producing severe impacts due to the total reduction of primary productivity. Here, we assessed changes to fungal community structure and decomposition activity in the soil, roots and rhizosphere of a Picea abies stand for a 2-year period following clearcutting compared to data from before tree harvest. We found that the termination of photosynthate flow through tree roots into soil is associated with profound changes in soil, both in decomposition processes and fungal community composition. The rhizosphere, representing an active compartment of high enzyme activity and high fungal biomass in the living stand, ceases to exist and starts to resemble bulk soil. Decomposing roots appear to separate from bulk soil and develop into hotspots of decomposition and important fungal biomass pools. We found no support for the involvement of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the decomposition of roots, but we found some evidence that root endophytic fungi may have an important role in the early stages of this process. In soil, activity of extracellular enzymes also decreased in the long term following the end of rhizodeposition by tree roots. {\textcopyright} 2017 International Society for Microbial Ecology.},

Proportions of meadows and forests change with environmental conditions and disturbance history. We investigated the belowground microbial communities associated with these two vegetation types and how they change across the meadow-forest transition at two sites in Oregon. Soils were sampled along replicate transects extending from meadow into forest. We quantified total bacterial and fungal biomass using direct microscopy and described the composition of bacterial and fungal communities using a DNA-based fingerprinting technique. Bacterial biomass was similar in meadow and forest soils, but fungal biomass was significantly higher in forest soil. Meadow and forest soils had distinct communities of bacteria and fungi. Bacterial communities near the meadow-forest boundary reflected current vegetation, but fungal communities under meadow vegetation near the forest edge were intermediate in composition between those found in meadow and forest soils. The more gradual transition observed with fungal communities may reflect the influence of tree roots and their associated ectomycorrhizal fungi or possibly colonization by saprotrophic fungi associated with tree litter accumulating near the forest edge. Invasion of forest-associated fungi into the meadow soils may presage subsequent expansion of forest vegetation into meadows. {\textcopyright} 2008 NRC.},

abstract = {Deconvoluting the relative contributions made by specific biotic and abiotic drivers to soil fungal community compositions facilitates predictions about the functional responses of ecosystems to environmental changes, such as losses of plant diversity, but it is hindered by the complex interactions involved. Experimental assembly of tree species allows separation of the respective effects of plant community composition (biotic components) and soil properties (abiotic components), enabling much greater statistical power than can be achieved in observational studies. We therefore analyzed these contributions by assessing, via pyrotag sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) rDNA region, fungal communities in young subtropical forest plots included in a large experiment on the effects of tree species richness. Spatial variables and soil properties were the main drivers of soil fungal alpha and beta-diversity, implying strong early-stage environmental filtering and dispersal limitation. Tree related variables, such as tree community composition, significantly affected arbuscular mycorrhizal and pathogen fungal community structure, while differences in tree host species and host abundance affected ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition. At this early stage of the experiment, only a limited amount of carbon inputs (rhizodeposits and leaf litter) was being provided to the ecosystem due to the size of the tree saplings, and persisting legacy effects were observed. We thus expect to find increasing tree related effects on fungal community composition as forest development proceeds. {\textcopyright} 2018 Wei{\ss}becker, Wubet, Lentendu, K{\"{u}}hn, Scholten, Bruelheide and Buscot.},

abstract = {Mushroom fruiting, the reproduction of fungi, has broad implications for forest health, terrestrial biomass turnover, and global carbon cycle. However, little is known about the difference in phenology and environmental drivers of mushroom fruiting between functional guilds, e.g., ectomycorrhizal (ECM) mutualists and saprotrophs (SAP). There is a remarkable difference between ECM and SAP fungi in their available carbon sources and lifecycles, and thus these fungal groups are likely to differ in fruiting phenology. We analyzed intra- and inter-annual phenological patterns of mushroom fruiting throughout the year using a long-term census dataset of mushroom-forming fungi in a Japanese oak forest in which a total of 11,923 mushroom counts (668 species) were recorded during monthly intervals from 1982 to 2011. ECM fungi showed a unimodal seasonal fruiting peak from mid-summer to early autumn; litter-decomposing fungi showed moderate fruiting peaks from early summer or early autumn, and the phenology of wood-decomposing fungi varied considerably among the genera. Each functional group was controlled by a different set of external factors; temperature and rainfall increased ECM fungal fruiting, but key factors substantially differed among the genera of litter- and wood-decomposing fungi in taxon-specific ways. Our results suggest that fungal fruiting phenology may be affected by the seasonality of carbohydrate availability. The highly scheduled reproduction of ECM fungi may reflect temperature-dependent increases and drought-induced decreases of photosynthetic activity in host plants rather than improved growth conditions for fungi during the summer. We argue that the way a fungus obtains carbohydrates may explain a substantial fraction of the fruiting phenology, which may make a differential contribution to the community structure of fungus-associated organisms and terrestrial biomass turnover based on fungal functional groups. {\textcopyright} 2012 Sato et al.},

Fungal mats can occur abundantly in forests and are widely distributed globally. We sampled ponderosa pine/white fir and mountain hemlock/noble fir communities at Crater Lake National Park for mat-forming soil fungi. Fungus collections were identified by DNA sequencing. Thirty-eight mat-forming genotypes were identified; members of the five most common genera (Gautieria, Lepiota, Piloderma, Ramaria, and Rhizopogon) comprised 67% of all collections. The mycorrhizal genera Alpova and Lactarius are newly identified as ectomycorrhizal mat-forming taxa, as are the saprotrophic genera Flavoscypha, Gastropila, Lepiota and Xenasmatella. Twelve typical mat forms are illustrated, representing both ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi that were found. Abundance of fungal mats was correlated with higher soil carbon to nitrogen ratios, fine woody debris and needle litter mass in both forest ecotypes. Definitions of fungal mats are discussed, along with some of the challenges in defining what comprises a fungal "mat". {\textcopyright} 2012 by the authors.},

abstract = {In forest ecosystems, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are important for plant growth and soil biogeochemical processes. The biochemical composition of ECM mycelium is an important fungal effect trait with consequences for its decomposition rate, and consequently on soil carbon pools and plant nutrition. Although the link between ECM fungi and leaf litter–released nutrients is well known, the response of ECM fungal biochemical composition to different leaf litter species remains poorly understood. To determine how leaf litter quality influences ECM fungi's biochemical profiles, we planted young beech trees in an oak forest and replaced the natural leaf litter with that of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), or lime (Tilia cordata). We assessed the biochemical profiles of ECM root tips colonized by common fungal taxa in temperate forests (i.e., Cenococcum geophilum, Inocybe sp., and Lactarius subdulcis), using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). ECM fungal biochemical composition changed with leaf litter species. Changes were apparent in the infrared absorption bands assigned to functional groups of lipids, amides, and carbohydrates. C. geophilum and L. subdulcis exhibited large spectral differences corresponding to the initial pattern of leaf litter chemical composition between samples collected in the beech and ash leaf litter treatments. In contrast, Inocybe sp. was influenced by lime, but with no differences between samples from ash or beech leaf litter treatments. Although the spectral bands affected by leaf litter type differed among ECM fungi, they were mainly related to amides, indicating a dynamic response of the fungal proteome to soil nutritional changes. Overall, the results indicate that the biochemical response of ECM fungi to leaf litter species varies among ECM fungal species and suggests that the biochemical composition of ECM mycelium is a fungal response trait, sensitive to environmental changes such as shifts in leaf litter species. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {Plant roots and the associated mycorrhizal fungal hyphae often selectively proliferate into patchily distributed soil nutrient hotspots, but interactions between these two components of a mycorrhizal root system are usually ignored or experimentally isolated in nutrient foraging studies. From studies in which both roots and mycorrhizal hyphae had access to nutrient hotspots, we compiled data on root foraging precision (increase in roots in nutrient hotspots relative to outside hotspots) of plant species from different ecosystems, ranging from temperate grasslands to subtropical forests. We found that root foraging precision across the wide range of plant species was strongly influenced by root morphology and mycorrhizal type. The precision of root nutrient foraging, as a plant functional trait, may coordinate with other root traits that are related to the economics of nutrient acquisition. High foraging precision is expected to associate with the strategy of fast return on the investment in roots, such as low construction cost, high metabolic rate and rapid turnover. Nutrient foraging by mycorrhizal fungi alone may be influenced by functional traits such as hyphal exploration distance, hyphal turnover, and hyphal uptake capacity and efficiency, but such data are limited to a small portion of mycorrhizal fungal species. We propose a conceptual framework in which to simulate nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition from both nutrient hotspots and outside hotspots in mixed-species plant communities. Simulation outputs suggest that plant species with varying root morphology and mycorrhizal type can be adaptive to a range of nutrient heterogeneity. Although there are still knowledge gaps related to nutrient foraging, as well as many unexplored plant and fungal species, we suggest that scaling nutrient foraging from individual plants to communities would advance understanding of plant species interactions and below-ground ecosystem function.

abstract = {We used a novel digital autoradiographic technique that enabled, for the first time, simultaneous visualization and quantification of spatial and temporal changes in carbon allocation patterns in ectomycorrhizal mycelia. Mycorrhizal plants of Pinus sylvestris L. were grown in microcosms containing non-sterile peat. The time course and spatial distribution of carbon allocation by P. sylvestris to mycelia of its mycorrhizal partners, Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr. and Suillus bovinus (L.): Kuntze, were quantified following 14C pulse labeling of the plants. Litter patches were used to investigate the effects of nutrient resource quality on carbon allocation. The wood-decomposer fungus Phanerochaete velutina (D.C.: Pers.) Parmasto was introduced to evaluate competitive and territorial interactions between its mycelial cords and the mycelial system of S. bovinus. Growth of ectomycorrhizal mycelium was stimulated in the litter patches. Nearly 60% of the C transferred from host plant to external mycorrhizal mycelium (< 2 mm from root surfaces) was allocated to mycelium in the patches, which comprised only 12% of the soil area available for mycelial colonization. Mycelia in the litter patch most recently colonized by mycorrhizal mycelium received the largest investment of carbon, amounting to 27 to 50% of the total 14C in external mycorrhizal mycelium. The amount of C transfer to external mycelium of S. bovinus following pulse labeling was reduced from a maximum of 167 nmol in systems with no saprotroph to a maximum of 61 nmol in systems interacting with P. velutina. The 14C content of S. bovinus mycelium reached a maximum 24-36 h after labeling in control microcosms, but allocation did not reach a peak until 56 h after labeling, when S. bovinus interacted with mycelium of P. velutina. The mycelium of S. bovinus contained 9% of the total 14C in the plants (including mycorrhizae) at the end of the experiment, but this was reduced to 4% in the presence of P. velutina. The results demonstrate the dynamic manner in which mycorrhizal mycelia deploy C when foraging for nutrients. The inhibitory effect of the wood-decomposer fungus P. velutina on C allocation to external mycorrhizal mycelium has important implications for nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown the importance of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EM) in forests both for nutrient availability and for carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in the soil. Yet so far they are not incorporated in forest ecosystem growth and yield models. Recent research suggests phosphorus (P) shortage could be a major constraints to forest productivity in the future. For a realistic simulation of future forest ecosystem functioning, inclusion of detailed soil P cycling and the trees-EM interaction is necessary. We developed a full ecosystem P model that simulates P uptake by roots and EM, allocation within trees, physiological deficiency effects on C assimilation and allocation, release through litter decomposition, coupled with water, C and nitrogen (N) fluxes accounted for in the mechanistic forest stand model ANAFORE. Our results confirm the importance of incorporating EM in forest ecosystem models and suggest that the lack of incorporation of P in models may result in an under- or overestimation of forest growth. This new model has the potential of being used to assess the response of trees and/or stands to nutrient availability under different climate and management scenarios.

abstract = {Aims: Tropical tree and lianas in the understory are limited by soil nutrients despite growing in extremely low light. It is not known if nomadic vines are also limited by nutrients in low light conditions. Methods: We measured differences in root architecture and mycorrhizal colonization, and leaf nutrients of a nomadic vine, Philodendron fragrantissimum (Araceae), in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization plots in a lowland tropical moist forest in central Panama to measure potential nutrient limitation. Results: Relative to plants in control plots, leaf P concentration was 54% higher and leaf N concentration was 10% higher for plants in the P- and N-addition treatments, respectively. The N:P of leaves suggested P-limitation in the N-addition treatment and the control but not in the P-addition treatment. Root branching was highest in the P-addition treatment, and P-addition reduced mycorrhizal colonization. Conclusions: The large effect of P fertilization suggests that, like many tropical plants, P. fragrantissimum has the potential to be P-limited. Although further study is needed, we suggest that nomadic vines be added to the growth forms that respond to nutrient addition in the forest understory and conclude that nutrient-limitation seems like the rule rather than the exception in the light-limited understory. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

As much as 100 different EM fungal species can coexist and interact with the same tree species, forming complex multispecies networks in soils. The degree of host specificity and structural properties of these interaction networks (e.g., nestedness and modularity) may influence plant and fungal community assembly and species coexistence, yet their structure has been little studied in northern coniferous forests, where trees depend on EM fungi for nutrient acquisition. We used high-throughput sequencing to characterize the composition and diversity of bulk soil and root-associated fungal communities in four co-occurring Pinaceae in a relic foredune plain located at {\^{I}}les de la Madeleine, Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. We found high EM fungal richness across the four hosts, with a total of 200 EM operational taxonomic units (OTUs), mainly belonging to the Agaricomycetes. Network analysis revealed an antinested pattern in both bulk soil and roots EM fungal communities. However, there was no detectable modularity (i.e., subgroups of interacting species) in the interaction networks, indicating a low level of specificity in these EM associations. In addition, there were no differences in EM fungal OTU richness or community structure among the four tree species. Limited shared resources and competitive exclusion typically restrict the number of taxa coexisting within the same niche. As such, our finding of high EM fungal richness and low host specificity highlights the need for further studies to determine the mechanisms enabling such a large number of EM fungal species to coexist locally on the same hosts. {\textcopyright} 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

We followed the appearance of the isotopic label in springtails inhabiting different layers of soil and litter (euedaphic, hemiedaphic and epigeic life forms) after in situ pulse-labelling of spruce trees with 13C[sbnd]CO2. Isotopic label was most frequently observed in euedaphic Collembola (26% of all samples), mainly in Protaphorura armata. The label was very rare in litter-dwelling (hemiedaphic) species (4%). Surprisingly, the label was often observed in epigeic Collembola (11%). During the period of 44 days after labelling, the proportion of labelled samples increased with time in euedaphic, but not in epigeic species, suggesting that freshly fixed carbon is assimilated by these collembolan groups via different pathways. Most likely, euedaphic species are trophically linked to plant roots, whereas epigeic species receive freshly fixed carbon from aboveground. The exact mechanisms and potential importance of the latter pathway should be evaluated in further research. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

Soil samples from this compartment were analyzed at 0, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days. For each sample, Illumina sequencing was used to assess any changes in the soil bacterial communities.

The community composition of bacteria at phylum and class levels was slightly influenced by both time and AMF. In addition, time and AMF significantly affected bacterial genera (e.g., Candidatus Solibacter, Dyella, Phenylobacterium) involved in litter decomposition. Opposite to the bacterial community composition, we found that overall soil bacterial OTU richness and diversity are relatively stable and were not significantly influenced by either time or AMF inoculation. OTU richness at phylum and class levels also showed consistent results with overall bacterial OTU richness. Our study provides new insight into the influence of AMF on soil bacterial communities at the genus level. {\textcopyright} 2017 Gui, Purahong, Hyde, Xu and Mortimer.},

abstract = {Mycoheterotrophic plants (MHPs) are leafless, achlorophyllous, and completely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for their carbon supply. Mycorrhizal symbiosis is a mutualistic association with fungi that is undertaken by the majority of land plants, but mycoheterotrophy represents a breakdown of this mutualism in that plants parasitize fungi. Most MHPs are associated with fungi that are mycorrhizal with autotrophic plants, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Although these MHPs gain carbon via the common mycorrhizal network that links the surrounding autotrophic plants, some mycoheterotrophic lineages are associated with saprotrophic (SAP) fungi, which are free-living and decompose leaf litter and wood materials. Such MHPs are dependent on the forest carbon cycle, which involves the decomposition of wood debris and leaf litter, and have a unique biology and evolutionary history. MHPs associated with SAP fungi (SAP-MHPs) have to date been found only in the Orchidaceae and likely evolved independently at least nine times within that family. Phylogenetically divergent SAP Basidiomycota, mostly Agaricales but also Hymenochaetales, Polyporales, and others, are involved in mycoheterotrophy. The fungal specificity of SAP-MHPs varies from a highly specific association with a single fungal species to a broad range of interactions with multiple fungal orders. Establishment of symbiotic culture systems is indispensable for understanding the mechanisms underlying plant–fungus interactions and the conservation of MHPs. Symbiotic culture systems have been established for many SAP-MHP species as a pure culture of free-living SAP fungi is easier than that of biotrophic AM or ECM fungi. Culturable SAP-MHPs are useful research materials and will contribute to the advancement of plant science. {\textcopyright} 2021, The Author(s).},

Russula and Cortinariaceae taxa were less abundant and boletoid taxa were more abundant as EMM relative to ectomycorrhizas. • The EMM community, sampled across seasons and years, was dynamic with a high degree of interspecific variation in response to CO2 enrichment and N fertilization. {\textcopyright} The Authors (2007).},

abstract = {In many ecosystems, browsing of large mammals can affect plant species
compositions. However, much less is known about potential above- and
below-ground trophic interactions of large browsing mammals. This study
focused on the direct and indirect effects of browsing on trophic and
abiotic interactions within forest ecosystems. To quantify above- and
below-ground cascade effects, white-tailed deer have been excluded for
over 18 years from three 4-ha plots, which were paired with same sized
deer access plots. Our results demonstrate complex direct and indirect
cascade effects on forest food webs. Deer exclusion directly altered
woody species composition and significantly increased shrub and sapling
density. Above-ground cascade effects include greater leaf litter
accumulation and higher arthropod density and biomass within the
exclosures. Below-ground indirect effects include significant decrease
in soil nutrients, and higher arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculum
potential in the exclosures. Because ecosystems have finite resource
availability, high deer density may imbalance the system by redirecting
resources toward maintaining deer biomass at the expense of multiple
trophic levels throughout the forest community. Both complex bottom up
and top down trophic cascade effects demonstrated largely unidirectional
negative responses suggesting that high deer density has reduced the
biodiversity of the forest community.},

abstract = {Macrofungal assemblages of Sitka spruce and Scots pine plantations in northern Britain were compared to those of semi-natural pine and oak woodlands, with a focus on threatened pinewood taxa. Fungal species-richness and species-composition were related to climate, soil, vegetation and stand variables across a range of crop stages. Altogether, 419 species were recorded (12 parasites, 76 wood saprotrophs, 174 mycorrhizal species, 157 litter saprotrophs). There were no differences in fungal species-richness between plantations and semi-natural woodlands nor any effects of crop species age or type. Significant positive correlations were recorded between fungal species-richness and ground vegetation diversity, and between wood saprotroph-richness and fallen deadwood volume. Each crop species type had a distinctive mycota related to differences in climate, tree and vegetation diversity. Over-mature stands had a higher proportion of 'late-successional' mycorrhizal species than the other growth stages. Nineteen Red Data list fungi species were recorded; plots nearer to semi-natural pinewood areas had a higher number of species records. These results highlight the importance of planted forests as a habitat for native fungi. Habitat value could be further enhanced through increasing the area of 'old-growth' non-intervention reserves, and locating these reserves near existing semi-natural woodland fragments.

abstract = {This survey of the spore germination requirements in the Hymenomycetes and the Gasteromycetes shows that saprophytes as xylophiles, which decompose wood and forest litter, and coprophiles, which live on dung, usually germinate easily even on simple nutrient media. Species forming ectomycorrhiza with trees or living as parasites require as a rule more particular conditions for germination. In the mycorrhiza-formers, chiefly agarics and boleti, germination can often be induced by exudates from tree roots or certain yeasts, in species of Leccinum by exudate from self mycelium. The heartrot fungi, chiefly those species of Aphyllophorales which are parasites on trees, germinate preferably when exposed to an increased CO2 content in the air or to exudates of certain micro-organisms. In many praticolous fungi, which are supposed to parasitize roots of grasses and herbs, germination is stimulated by various yeasts. The possibility of interpreting these particular germination conditions as adaptations to a parasitic or symbiotic life is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1984 Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract = {In the context of forestry, the concept of allelopathy has recently been expanded from a plant to plant interference phenomenon to an ecosystem-level phenomenon that is influenced by ecosystem disturbance. This chapter reviews the latest development in our understanding of forest allelopathy and the ways in which this new knowledge can be used in sustainable forest management. Allelopathic effects of certain canopy trees on tree seedlings and understory plants have direct effects on forest renewal. Likewise some understory plants with allelopathic property can have controlling effects on tree regeneration and species composition. In fire adapted boreal forests, particularly natural fires, the level and distribution of fire severity plays a critical role in the manifestation of forest allelopathy. The high severity fires break down allelochemicals by thermal decomposition, create favorable seedbed by consuming forest floor humus and releasing nutrients and removing competing plants by killing underground regenerating organs. Clearcut harvesting and low-severity fires on the other hand, may promote vegetative regeneration of understory plants with competitive and allelopathic properties as their underground perennating structures remain unharmed. This may cause retrogressive succession by resisting tree colonization and inducing long-term habitat degradation. Research in the last two decades has increased our understanding on the mechanism of forest allelopathy in fire adapted boreal forests, but our knowledge in forest allelopathy in tropical forest is very limited. Control of competing and allelopathic plants after forest harvesting is a serious issue in forestry and public opinion is not favorable in using chemical herbicides. Alternative methods such as use of allelopathic straw mulch, herbicides of biological origin (bialaphose), planting tree seedling pre-inoculated with mycorrhiza, and scarification and spot fertilization at planting have produced good results. It is possible to develop alternative methods of weed control in forestry by using allelopathy principle. However, substantial infusion of research and development funds is necessary to make significant progress in this area. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media LLC.},

abstract = {Aims: Changes in plant net primary production due to climate change can influence aboveground and belowground litter inputs to forest soils. We aim to examine the effects of such changes on soil carbon in subtropical forest ecosystems where these effects have not been thoroughly investigated. Methods: We manipulated aboveground litter inputs and excluded roots in a factorial design, and measured the effects of each treatment and their interactions on soil carbon (C) and soil microbial community structure. Results: After only 3 years of treatment, aboveground litter addition and root exclusion respectively caused 9% and 21% reductions in soil C concentration in the 0–10 cm soil, likely through different mechanisms. The reduction of soil C with aboveground litter addition was attributed to a priming effect, while reduced root-derived C inputs were likely the cause of the C reduction associated with root exclusion. PLFA analysis showed that both aboveground and belowground litter manipulations reduced Gram-positive bacteria biomass (by 30%–58%) compare to the control, but only root exclusion significantly reduced the actinobacteria biomarkers (by 46%–58%). Fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and ratios of Gram-negative to Gram-positive bacteria and bacteria to fungi did not differ among treatments. Conclusion: Our results show that root-derived C inputs exert a stronger control on soil C concentrations and microbial community structures than aboveground litter does in subtropical natural forest soils. Our study also highlights that that both increases in aboveground litter and decreases in belowground C input to soil can lead to reduced soil C. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

These soils are often dominated by ectomycorrhizal (EcM) roots, but little is known about how EcM fungi degrade PAHs, or the overall effect of field colonized EcM roots on the fate of PAHs. The ability of eight EcM fungi to degrade PAHs in liquid culture spiked with 14C labelled PAHs was investigated. Microcosms were used to determine the impact of naturally colonized mycorrhizal pine seedlings on PAH mineralization and volatilization. Only two EcM fungi (Thelephora terrestris and Laccaria laccata) degraded at least one PAH and none were able to mineralize the PAHs in pure culture. Where degradation occurred, the compounds were only mono-oxygenated. EcM pine seedlings did not alter naphthalene mineralization or volatilization but retarded fluorene mineralization by 35% compared with unplanted, ectomycorrhizosphere soil inoculated, microcosms. The EcM fungi possessed limited PAH degrading abilities, which may explain why EcM dominated microcosms retarded fluorene mineralization. This observation is considered in relation to the 'Gadgil-effect', where retarded litter decomposition has been observed in the presence of EcM roots. {\textcopyright} New Phytologist (2004).},

There were significant inter- and intra-specific differences in extraradical mycelial growth and morphology. The mycelial systems of both strains of P. involutus were diffuse and extended more rapidly than those of S. bovinus. Depending on the strain, P. involutus mycelia were either highly plane filled, with high mass fractal dimension (a measure of space filling) or sparse, low mass fractal dimension systems. Older mycelial systems persisted as linear cords interlinking ectomycorrhizal tips. S. bovinus produced either a mycelium with a mixture of mycelial cords and diffuse fans that rapidly filled explorable area, or a predominately corded mycelium of minimal area cover. In the soil microcosms, mass fractal dimension and mycelial cover tended to increase with time, mycelia encountering litter having significantly greater values.

With respect to nutrient relations, montane forests are characterized by slow decomposition of organic matter, high investment in below-ground biomass and poor litter quality, relative to tropical lowland forests. However, within TMF there is considerable variation in substrate age, parent material, disturbance and species composition. Here we emphasize that many TMFs are likely to be co-limited by multiple nutrients, and that feedback among soil properties, species traits, microbial communities and environmental conditions drive forest productivity and soil carbon storage. To date, studies of the biogeochemistry of montane forests have been restricted to a few, mostly neotropical, sites and focused mainly on trees while ignoring mycorrhizas, epiphytes and microbial community structure. Incorporating the geographic, environmental and biotic variability in TMF will lead to a greater recognition of plant-soil feedbacks that are critical to understanding constraints on productivity, both under present conditions and under future climate, nitrogen-deposition and land-use scenarios. {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2015.},

abstract = {Tropical forests are a haven of biodiversity hosting the richest macrofungi in the World. However, the rate of forest loss greatly exceeds the rate of species documentation and this increases the risk of losing macrofungi diversity to extinction. A field study was carried out in Kereita, Kikuyu Escarpment Forest, southern part of Aberdare range forest to determine effect of indigenous forest conversion to plantation forest on diversity of macrofungi. Macrofungi diversity was assessed in a 22 year old Pinus patula (Pine) plantation and a pristine indigenous forest during dry (short rains, December, 2014) and wet (long rains, May, 2015) seasons. Field and laboratory methods included recording abundance and presence of fruiting bodies, taxonomic work and analysis of diversity in terms of density, species diversity indices and richness. A total number of 224 species were distributed across 28 families and 76 genera. Macrofungi species from families of Agaricaceae (20%), Mycenaceae (13%), Polyporaceae (10%) and Tricholomataceae (9%) were commonly represented taxa in the ecosystem. Most of the macrofungi recorded were saprophytic, mostly colonizing the litter and wood (41% and 36% respectively) based substrates, followed by soil organic matter species (15%). Ecto-mycorrhizal fungi (5%) and parasitic fungi (3%) were the least represented. Indigenous forests (natural ecosystems) recorded a wide range of mushroom assemblage (average of 6.5 species in a 400m2 plot and 3.5 individual fruiting bodies in 1m2 plot) compared to pine plantation forest. Conversion of indigenous forest to pine plantation altered species composition, but did not affect species diversity. More than 50% of the total macrofungi species were encountered during the wet season. Our results confirm diverse macrofungi community in forested ecosystems in Kenya, and need for their conservation. {\textcopyright} Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences.},

abstract = {We compiled quantitative estimates on symbiotic N2 fixation by trees in agroforestry systems (AFS) in order to evaluate the critical environmental and management factors that affect the benefit from N2 fixation to system N economy. The so-called "N2-fixing tree" is a tripartite symbiotic system composed of the plant, N2-fixing bacteria, and mycorrhizae-forming fungi. Almost 100 recognised rhizobial species associated with legumes do not form an evolutionary homologous clade and are functionally diverse. The global bacterial diversity is still unknown. Actinorrhizal symbioses in AFS remain almost unstudied. Dinitrogen fixation in AFS should be quantified using N isotopic methods or long-term system N balances. The general average ± standard deviation of tree dependency on N2 fixation (%Ndfa) in 38 cases using N isotopic analyses was 59 ± 16. 6 %. Under humid and sub-humid conditions, the percentage was higher in young (69 ± 10. 7 %) and periodically pruned trees (63 ± 11. 8 %) than in free-growing trees (54 ± 11. 7 %). High variability was observed in drylands (range 10-84 %) indicating need for careful species and provenance selection in these areas. Annual N2 fixation was the highest in improved fallow and protein bank systems, 300-650 kg [N] ha-1. General average for 16 very variable AFS was 246 kg [N] ha-1, which is enough for fulfilling crop N needs for sustained or increasing yield in low-input agriculture and reducing N-fertiliser use in large-scale agribusiness. Leaf litter and green mulch applications release N slowly to the soil and mostly benefit the crop through long-term soil improvement. Root and nodule turnover and N rhizodeposition from N2-fixing trees are sources of easily available N for the crop yet they have been largely ignored in agroforestry research. There is also increasing evidence on direct N transfer from N2-fixing trees to crops, e. g. via common mycelial networks of mycorrhizal fungi or absorption of tree root exudates by the crop. Research on the below-ground tree-crop-microbia interactions is needed for fully understanding and managing N2 fixation in AFS. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {As anthropogenic N deposition has been suspected to be the main reason for the decline of macromycetous sporocarp production in forest ecosystems, various N-fertilization experiments were started in the mid 1990s. The dynamics of ectomycorrhizal (root-inhabiting) and terricolous saprobic (litter-inhabiting) fungal communities were studied by exhaustive sporocarp inventories in a substitution Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest in two 256-m2 plots sampled for periods of 1 week at 1-m2 resolution between 1994 and 2007. N was added to the soil twice per year in one plot from the fourth year onwards. The effects of N input and time on aboveground fungal communities were assessed using redundancy analysis, principal response curves and non-parametric multivariate ANOVA. Results of this long-term experiment revealed that both ectomycorrhizal and saprobic fungal communities responded to an increase in soil N input. The ectomycorrhizal community reacted by a fast decrease in sporocarp production and in species richness, whereas the saprobic community was less affected. The response was highly species specific, especially for the saprobic community. The difference in species composition between control and fertilized plots was significant after 1 year of N addition for ectomycorrhizal fungi and only after 3 years for saprobic fungi. An aging effect affected sporocarp production in the whole area. For both communities, this unidirectional drift in species composition was as important as the treatment effect. This result highlights the importance of considering the respective role of treatment and year effects in long-term field experiments on fungal communities. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Fungi are major players in the carbon cycle in forest ecosystems due to the wide range of interactions they have with plants either through soil degradation processes by litter decayers or biotrophic interactions with pathogenic and ectomycorrhizal symbionts. Secretion of fungal proteins mediates these interactions by allowing the fungus to interact with its environment and/or host. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis independently appeared several times throughout evolution and involves approximately 80% of trees. Despite extensive physiological studies on ECM symbionts, little is known about the composition and specificities of their secretomes. In this study, we used a bioinformatics pipeline to predict and analyze the secretomes of 49 fungal species, including 11 ECM fungi, wood and soil decayers and pathogenic fungi to tackle the following questions: (1) Are there differences between the secretomes of saprophytic and ECM fungi? (2) Are small-secreted proteins (SSPs) more abundant in biotrophic fungi than in saprophytic fungi? and (3) Are there SSPs shared between ECM, saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi? We showed that the number of predicted secreted proteins is similar in the surveyed species, independently of their lifestyle. The secretome from ECM fungi is characterized by a restricted number of secreted CAZymes, but their repertoires of secreted proteases and lipases are similar to those of saprotrophic fungi. Focusing on SSPs, we showed that the secretome of ECM fungi is enriched in SSPs compared with other species. Most of the SSPs are coded by orphan genes with no known PFAM domain or similarities to known sequences in databases. Finally, based on the clustering analysis, we identified shared- and lifestyle-specific SSPs between saprotrophic and ECM fungi. The presence of SSPs is not limited to fungi interacting with living plants as the genome of saprotrophic fungi also code for numerous SSPs. ECM fungi shared lifestyle-specific SSPs likely involved in symbiosis that are good candidates for further functional analyses. {\textcopyright} 2015 Pellegrin, Morin, Martin and Veneault-Fourrey.},

abstract = {The two components of soil respiration, autotrophic respiration (from roots, mycorrhizal hyphae and associated microbes) and heterotrophic respiration (from decomposers), was separated in a root trenching experiment in a Norway spruce forest. In June 2003, cylinders (29.7 cm diameter) were inserted to 50 cm soil depth and respiration was measured both outside (control) and inside the trenched areas. The potential problems associated with the trenching treatment, increased decomposition of roots and ectomycorrhizal mycelia and changed soil moisture conditions, were handled by empirical modelling. The model was calibrated with respiration, moisture and temperature data of 2004 from the trenched plots as a training set. We estimate that over the first 5 months after the trenching, 45% of respiration from the trenched plots was an artefact of the treatment. Of this, 29% was a water difference effect and 16% resulted from root and mycelia decomposition. Autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration contributed to about 50% each of total soil respiration in the control plots averaged over the two growing seasons. We show that the potential problems with the trenching, decomposing roots and mycelia and soil moisture effects, can be handled by a modelling approach, which is an alternative to the sequential root harvesting technique. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {We investigated the response of soil microbial communities in tropical ecosystems to increased nutrient deposition, such as predicted by anthropogenic change scenarios. Moderate amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus and their combination were added along an altitudinal transect. We expected microorganisms and microbial grazers (testate amoebae) to significantly respond to nutrient additions with the effect increasing with increasing altitude and with duration of nutrient additions. Further, we expected nutrients to alter grazer-prey interrelationships. Indeed, nutrient additions strongly altered microbial biomass (MB) and community structure as well as the community structure of testate amoebae. The response of microorganisms varied with both altitude and duration of nutrient addition. The results indicate that microorganisms are generally limited by N, but saprotrophic fungi also by P. Also, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi benefited from N and/or P addition. Parallel to MB, testate amoebae benefited from the addition of N but were detrimentally affected by P, with the addition of P negating the positive effect of N. Our data suggests that testate amoeba communities are predominantly structured by abiotic factors and by antagonistic interactions with other microorganisms, in particular mycorrhizal fungi, rather than by the availability of prey. Overall, the results suggest that the decomposer system of tropical montane rainforests significantly responds to even moderate changes in nutrient inputs with the potential to cause major ramifications of the whole ecosystem including litter decomposition and plant growth. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) accumulation into woody debris is well documented, but the forms of N translocated, the mechanism through which this occurs (purportedly via translocation by cord-forming fungi) and the temporal pattern of N accumulation are not well studied. In soil microcosms, we incubated wood blocks (Pseudotsuga menziesii) inoculated with the cord-forming decay fungus Hypholoma fasciculare, and applied four forms of isotopically-labeled N (15NH4+, 15NO3-, 15N-glycine and 15N labeled litter) at the mycelial growing fronts to evaluate translocation and accumulation of diverse N sources by wood-decay fungi. Identically treated un-inoculated wood blocks were incubated. Three sampling times (6, 18 and 30days after N addition) were used to identify trends in 15N transfer and total N accumulation. Wood blocks inoculated with H. fasciculare assimilated significantly more 15N than un-inoculated blocks for all 15N treatments on at least one sampling occasion. After a total of 73days of incubation in microcosms, inoculated wood blocks increased in absolute N content by 211% relative to control blocks, but 80% of this accumulated N was lost by day 97. The small amount of 15N that was transferred into wood contrasted with the large increase in total N, suggesting that the site of N transfer was largely from soil under the wood blocks rather than at the site of 15N injection. The precipitous decline in N content was attributed to visible indications of mycelial senescence, possibly due to carbon limitation. If these findings are extrapolated to a cut-block, it follows that woody debris on the forest floor colonized by wood decay fungi would accumulate N, at least in the early stages of decay, and this process may immobilize N after harvest. If retention of N on site after harvest is a management objective, site preparation that maximizes accumulation of N in woody debris by saprotrophic fungi should be employed. This would involve homogenously distributing woody debris on site in close contact with the forest floor in order to promote fungal colonization and N accumulation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In an old growth coniferous forest located in the central Cascade Mountains, Oregon, we added or removed aboveground litter and terminated live root activity by trenching to determine sources of soil respiration. Annual soil efflux from control plots ranged from 727 g C m-2 year-1 in 2002 to 841 g C m-2 year-1 in 2003. We used aboveground litter inputs (149.6 g C m-2 year-1) and differences in soil CO2 effluxes among treatment plots to calculate contributions to total soil efflux by roots and associated rhizosphere organisms and by heterotrophic decomposition of organic matter derived from aboveground and belowground litter. On average, root and rhizospheric respiration (R r) contributed 23%, aboveground litter decomposition contributed 19%, and belowground litter decomposition contributed 58% to total soil CO 2 efflux, respectively. These values fall within the range of values reported elsewhere, although our estimate of belowground litter contribution is higher than many published estimates, which we argue is a reflection of the high degree of mycorrhizal association and low nutrient status of this ecosystem. Additionally, we found that measured fluxes from plots with doubled needle litter led to an additional 186 g C m-2 year-1 beyond that expected based on the amount of additional carbon added; this represents a priming effect of 187%, or a 34% increase in the total carbon flux from the plots. This finding has strong implications for soil C storage, showing that it is inaccurate to assume that increases in net primary productivity will translate simply and directly into additional belowground storage. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {We studied the sensitivity of soil microbial communities and ecosystem processes to variation in the vertical and horizontal structure of decomposer food web under nitrogen poor and N-enriched conditions. Microcosms with humus and litter layer of boreal forest floor, birch seedlings infected with mycorrhizal fungi, and decomposer food webs with differing trophic group and species composition of soil fauna were constructed. During the second growing period for the birch, we irrigated half of the microcosms with urea solution, and the other half with deionised water to create two levels of N concentration in the substrate. During the experiment night time respirations of the microcosms were measured, and the water leached through the microcosms was analysed for concentration of mineral N, and nematode numbers. The microcosms were destructively sampled after 37 weeks for plant biomass and N uptake, structure of soil animal and microbial community (indicated by PLFA profiles), and physical and chemical properties of the humus and litter materials. Predatory mites and nematodes had a negative influence on the biomass of their microbivorous and microbi-detritivorous prey, and microbi-detritivores affected the biomass and community structure of microbes (indicated by PLFA-analysis). Moreover, predatory mites and nematodes increased microbial biomass and changed the microbial community structure. The decomposer food web structure affected also N uptake and growth of plants. Microbi-detritivorous fauna had a positive effect, whereas predators of microbial and detritus feeding fauna exerted a negative influence on plant N uptake and biomass production. The impact of atrophic group on the microbes and plant was also strongly dependent on species composition within the group. Nitrogen addition magnified the influence of food web structure on microbial biomass and plant N uptake. We suggest that addition of urea-N to the soil modified the animal-microbe interaction by increasing microbial growth and altering community structure of microbes. The presence of microbi-detritivores and predators reduced loss of carbon from the microcosms, and the food web structure influenced also water holding capacity of the materials. The changes in plant growth, nutrient cycling, size of N and C pools, and in the physical properties of the soil emphasize the importance and diversity of indirect consequences of decomposer food web structure.},

abstract = {Changes in temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration that are expected in the coming decades will have profound impacts on terrestrial ecosystem net primary production (NPP). Nearly all models linking forest NPP with soil carbon (C) predict that increased NPP will result in either unchanged or increased soil C storage, and that decreased NPP will result in decreased soil C storage. However, linkages between forest productivity and soil C storage may not be so simple and direct. In an old-growth coniferous forest located in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, OR, USA, we experimentally doubled needle litter inputs, and found that actual soil respiration rates exceeded those expected due to the C added by the extra needles. Here, we estimated that this 'priming effect' accounted for 11.5-21.6% of annual CO2 efflux from litter-amended plots, or an additional 137-256 g C m-2 yr-1 loss of stored C to the atmosphere. Soil priming was seasonal, with greatest amounts occurring in June-August coincident with peaks in temperature and dry summer conditions. As a result of priming, mineral soil was more resistant to further mineralization during laboratory incubations. Soil lignin-derived phenols in the Double Litter plots were more oxidized than in the control, suggesting that the soil residue was more degraded. Our hypothesis that excess dissolved organic C produced from the added litter provided the link between the forest floor and mineral soil and a substrate for soil priming was not supported. Instead, the rhizosphere, and associated mycorrhizal fungi, likely responded directly to the added aboveground litter inputs. Our results revealed that enhanced NPP may lead to accelerated processing of some stored soil C, but that the effects of increased NPP on ecosystem C storage will be based on a net balance among all ecosystem C pools and are likely to be ecosystem-dependant. Forest C models need to include these complex linkages between forest productivity and soil C storage. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

organic matter decomposition via the production of hydrolytic and
oxidative extracellular enzymes. The influence of climate change on
heterotrophic microbial activity remains poorly understood, not least in
terms of the differential sensitivity of microbial functional groups to
warming and altered precipitation regimes. Cord-forming basidiomycete
fungi dominate primary decomposition in temperate woodlands. We
investigate the interactive influence of elevated temperature (3 degrees
C), wetting and drying (6-9\% increase and 5-6\% decrease of soil
moisture, respectively) on saprotrophic basidiomycete-mediated beech
(Fagus sylvatica) wood decomposition, as well as on hydrolytic
(beta-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, beta-xylosidase,
N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, acid phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase)
and oxidative (peroxidase and phenoloxidase) enzyme potential
activities, in woodland soil mesocosms. While drying decreased beech
wood decomposition rate, warming resulted in an increased rate and
compensated for the negative effect of drying. Moisture regulated the
extracellular enzyme pool; all enzymes except leucine aminopeptidase had
significantly greater potential activity under wetting than drying.
Again, elevated temperature consistently compensated for the negative
effect of drying, but did not increase extracellular enzyme potential
activity, alone or in combination with wetting. This reflects microbial
production (fungal biomass was not increased under these conditions)
rather than in situ effects on enzyme kinetics. N-acetyl-glucosaminidase
and acid phosphatase displayed differential responses to temperature and
moisture in systems dominated by different fungi. Decomposer communities
appear to be more functionally resilient to the combined effects of
elevated temperature and altered moisture than is suggested based on the
manipulation of single abiotic variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

abstract = {Crop production in subsistence agriculture in tropical Africa is still sustained mainly by short-to medium-term fallows to recuperate natural fertility of the soils. Microbes play a pivotal role both in the process of soil fertility restoration and in nutrient acquisition by the crops. Here we ask the question how the duration of fallow affects the composition of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities and their contribution to maize nutrition and growth, in acidic, low P soils of southern Cameroon. This question has been addressed in a bioassay where soils collected from continuously cropped fields, short-term fallows dominated by Chromolaena odorata and long-term fallows (secondary forests) have been sterilized and back- and cross inoculated with living soils from the different land-use systems. Particular microbes larger than the pore size of the filter paper (mainly the fungi including the AMF) contained in the cropped and short-fallowed soils caused greater growth and P uptake stimulations to the maize as compared to the forest soil. By using molecular profiling, we demonstrated a shift in the composition of AMF communities along a gradient of fallow duration, changing from dominance by Rhizophagus in the forest fallow soil, to dominance by Claroideoglomus under cropland. Our results contradict the hypothesis that deterioration of quality of root symbiotic communities would be responsible for a rapid yield decline following deforestation, and indicate a positive feedback of cropping on mycorrhizal functioning under conditions of shifting agriculture in tropical Africa. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This was a study of vegetation and soil properties in tree-fall gaps in a coniferous forest of the Pacific Northwest. It had three objectives: (1) to determine if there are correlations between above-ground vegetation and below-ground soil properties within large 50 m diameter gaps, (2) to determine how large gaps influence forest soils compared with non-gap soils, and (3) to measure the effects of differently sized gaps on gap soils. To address these objectives, circular canopy gaps were created in old-growth Douglas-fir forests of the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Oregon Cascade Mountains. To address the first objective, within-gap soil spatial patterns were compared with above ground distributions of both vegetation and large woody debris in two large gaps. Spatial and Pearson correlation analyses showed no consistent correlations between soil characteristics and above ground vegetation and coarse woody debris. With reference to the second objective, statistically significant differences between gap and non-gap soil characteristics were observed. Soil moisture, temperature and denitrification potentials were all elevated in forest 50 m diameter gaps and litter depth, labile C, soil respiration, -gluosidase activity, and ectomytcorrhizal mat concentrations were all reduced. Comparisons between north and south gap soils, showed significant differences in soil characteristics in one but not the other 50 m gap. The third objective was addressed by documenting gap size effects on differences between gap and non gap soil characteristics in two gaps each of 10, 20, 30, and 50 m diameter. Differences between gap and nongap soil moisture, litter depth and ectomycorrhizal mat coverages were essentially the same regardless of gap size. Soil respiration rates and soil organic matter concentrations were similar in 10 m gaps but both lower in gaps 20 m and larger. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Northwest Scientific Association.

abstract = {The ectomycorrhizal fungus Hysterangium setchellii (Fisher) forms extensive hyphal mats at the soil-litter interface with the roots of its host tree Douglas fir {Pseudotsuga menziesii [(Mirb.) Franco]}. Microbial biomass, needle decomposition rates, nutrient release from needles and exchangeable soil nutrients were measured in ectomycorrhizal mat soils and adjacent non-mat soils in a second-growth Douglas fir forest periodically throughout 1 yr. Microbial biomass and needle decomposition were 4.0 and 1.1 times higher, respectively, in mat soils than in adjacent non-mat soils during the year of sampling. After 1 yr of decomposition, needle litter concentrations of K and Mg decreased in both soil types, and release of both nutrients was greater in mats than in non-mat soils. Needle litter concentrations of Ca, Mn, Cu. Zn and Al increased during the year in both soil types, but nutrient absorption by needles tended to be highest in non-mat soils. Concentrations of N, P, Fe and B in needle litter did not change during the year, yet nearly twice as much N and P were released in mat soils compared to non-mat soils, suggesting either faster decomposition or nutrient import to mat soils. Soil solution concentrations of nh4, P, K, Mg and Zn measured by absorption onto ion-exchange resins, did not differ between mat and non-mat soils. Mat soils had higher concentrations of NO3, Fe, Cu and B but lower concentrations of Ca and Mn compared to non-mat soils. Nutrients released from the decomposing needles but not absorbed by ion-exchange resins must be rapidly removed from the soil solution either by plant roots, microbial tissue, saprophytic fungi or via ectomycorrhizal translocation to host trees. Our data suggest that the ectomycorrhizal fungus H. seichelli provides an improved microcnvironment for organic matter decomposition resulting in faster release of N, P, K, and Mg and more efficient removal of the nutrients from the soil solution. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {The decomposition of plant organic matter and the stability of soil aggregates are important components of soil carbon cycling, and the relationship between decomposition rate and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has recently received considerable attention. The interaction of AMF with their associated microorganisms and the consequences for litter decomposition and soil aggregation still remain fairly unclear. In a laboratory pot experiment we simultaneously tested the single and combined effects of one AMF species (Rhizophagus irregularis) and a natural non-AMF microbial community on the decomposition of small wooden sticks and on soil aggregation. To disentangle effects of hyphae and roots we placed mesh bags as root exclusion compartments in the soil. The decomposition of the wooden sticks in this compartment was significantly reduced in the presence of AMF, but not with the non-AMF microbial community only, compared to the control, while aggregation was increased in all treatments compared to the control. We suggest that AMF directly (via localized nutrient removal or altered moisture conditions) or indirectly (by providing an alternative carbon source) inhibited the activity of decomposers, leading to different levels of plant litter degradation under our experimental settings. Reduced decomposition of woody litter in presence of AMF can be important for nutrient cycling in AMF-dominated forests and in the case of woody plants and perennials that develop lignified roots in grasslands. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Fungal community composition often shifts in response to warmer temperatures, which might influence decomposition of recalcitrant carbon (C). We hypothesized that evolutionary trade-offs would enable recalcitrant C-using taxa to respond more positively to warming than would labile C-using taxa. Accordingly, we performed a warming experiment in an Alaskan boreal forest and examined changes in the prevalence of fungal taxa. In a complementary field trial, we characterized the ability of fungal taxa to use labile C (glucose), intermediate C (hemicellulose or cellulose), or recalcitrant C (lignin). We also assigned taxa to functional groups (e.g., free-living filamentous fungi, ectomycorrhizal fungi, and yeasts) based on taxonomic identity. We found that response to warming varied most among taxa at the order level, compared to other taxonomic ranks. Among orders, ability to use lignin was significantly related to increases in prevalence in response to warming. However, the relationship was weak, given that lignin use explained only 9% of the variability in warming responses. Functional groups also differed in warming responses. Specifically, free-living filamentous fungi and ectomycorrhizal fungi responded positively to warming, on average, but yeasts responded negatively. Overall, warming-induced shifts in fungal communities might be accompanied by an increased ability to break down recalcitrant C. This change in potential function may reduce soil C storage under global warming. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Aim: Trees associating with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi typically occur in infertile soils and use nutrients more conservatively than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees. We hypothesized that ECM trees would have greater nutrient resorption (i.e., proportion of nutrients resorbed during leaf senescence) than AM trees. Location: Global. Methods: We synthesized nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) resorption data from 378 species from sub/tropical, temperate and boreal forests, including 43 studies where ECM and AM trees co-occurred, and conducted a meta-analysis. Additionally, we quantified N resorption in 45 plots varying in ECM-AM tree abundances in the temperate deciduous forests of southern Indiana, USA. Results: Overall, resorption patterns were driven primarily by mycorrhizal type, climate zone, and to a lesser degree, leaf habit. In the boreal forest, P resorption was 76% greater for ECM than AM trees (p <.05). In the sub/tropics, AM trees resorbed 30% more N than ECM trees. At the sites where AM and ECM trees co-occurred, ECM trees resorbed more N in temperate forests (15% greater; p <.001) whereas AM trees tended to resorb more N in sub/tropical forests (by 29%; p =.08). Besides, deciduous ECM trees resorbed more N (10%) and P (15%) than deciduous AM trees, while evergreen ECM and AM trees did not differ. In the deciduous forests of Indiana, where ECM and AM trees co-occurred, the relative abundance of ECM trees in a plot was positively correlated to plot-scale N resorption (R2 =.25, p =.001), indicating greater nutrient conservatism with increasing ECM-dominance. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that mycorrhizal association – in addition to other factors – is correlated with the degree to which trees recycle nutrients, with the strongest effects occurring for N resorption by temperate deciduous trees. {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Ectomycorrhizal Hydnum and Cortinarius had higher $\delta$15N than other ectomycorrhizal fungi, suggesting use of 15N-enriched, deeper nitrogen. Russula had lower $\delta$15N than other ectomycorrhizal fungi and resembled some litter decay genera, suggesting use of litter-derived nitrogen. There was little variation in $\delta$15N among other genera of ectomycorrhizal fungi, indicating limited functional diversity in nitrogen use. Saprotrophic Leotia, Gymnopus, Hypholoma, Pholiota, Rhodocollybia and Calocera had $\delta$15N values similar to ectomycorrhizal fungi, indicating overlap in use of older nitrogen from soil or roots or use of newly fixed nitrogen. Genera of litter and wood decay fungi varied up to 6‰ in $\delta$13C and 10‰ in $\delta$15N, suggesting large differences in carbon and nitrogen sources and processing. Similar $\delta$13C between white and brown rot wood decay fungi also suggest that white rot fungi do not use lignin-derived carbon. Together, these $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N patterns of fungi from Finnish boreal forests enhance our knowledge of fungal functional diversity and indicate broad use of litter, wood and soil resources. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract = {This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Quercus rubra L. (Red Oak, Northern Red Oak; syn. Q. borealis, Q. maxima) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution; habitat; communities; responses to biotic factors; responses to environment; structure and physiology; phenology; floral and seed characters; herbivores and disease; history; and conservation. Quercus rubra is a large deciduous tree native to eastern North America. In its native range this species is one of the most important mid-successional tree species. Since the 18th century Q. rubra has been introduced into forest management in Europe and elsewhere. Currently, Q. rubra is a naturalized species in 23 countries. It is an important source of wood, and this was one of the most important reasons for its introduction in forests. In forest management this species is valued for its high growth rate and drought resistance. Red Oak is also widely cultivated in Europe for its ornamental value—red leaves in autumn and smooth, grey bark. Red Oak is a threat to native species within its introduced range as it can alter environmental conditions beneath its canopy, especially by decreasing light availability and litter decomposition rate. Such conditions also contribute to biotic homogenization of the understorey vegetation. Q. rubra is widely dispersed by small mammals and birds, up to 1,500 m from seed sources, thereby increasing its potential invasiveness. In Europe Q. rubra seems to be less prone to herbivores and fungi, in contrast to its native range, where it is grazed by ungulates and insects, and infected by Phytophthora and oak wilt. Due to its higher tolerance to drought than native European oaks, Q. rubra is claimed to be one of the species replacing native trees which are decreasing due to climate warming. However, consideration of all possible consequences is needed in wide-scale introduction of alien species, such as Q. rubra, due to negative impacts on native ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2020 British Ecological Society},

abstract = {A central tenet of biological science is that living organisms modify their environments. Metabiosis is a form of ecological dependence in which one organism or a functional group of organisms must modify the environment before another organism or functional group of organisms can live or thrive in it. Soil ecosystems are modified by metabionts to create habitats or supply resources for which dependent organisms may adapt, evolve and hence diversify. Thus, the diversity of the soil biota and its functional capabilities may to a large extent be the result of and dependent upon metabiotic activity and influences. Examples of metabiotic activity in soil ecosystems are: plants are the main source of O2 for the soil biota; decomposers deplete soil O2 thus enabling the growth of microaerophiles or anaerobes; ammonium released by bacterial deamination supports the growth of autotrophic ammonium-oxidisers; burrowing earthworms improve soil drainage and create aeration channels for aerobic biota; detoxification of plant residues by biodegraders permits proliferation of toxin-sensitive organisms; wood decay by microbes creates habitats for arthropods associated with rotting wood; arthropod comminution of litter liberates nutrients that facilitate microbial activity. Some metabionts, the panmetabionts, had a global influence by modifying the biosphere, its evolving biota and by maintaining its biogeochemistry. For example, during the development of the biosphere the cyanobacteria began the transformation of the atmosphere through the production of O2. The accumulation of atmospheric O2 had an overwhelming influence on the formation of soils, their physico-chemistry and biology, in particular the evolution of diverse major groups of aerobic terrestrial organisms (plants, fungi and animals). Many practices to improve soil fertility, e.g. agro-forestry, mulching, legume inoculation, minimum tillage are applications of metabiotic techniques, which maintain or improve soil biodiversity and its functional potentiality. Conversely, where ecosystems are degraded through human activity, e.g. forest destruction, irrigation with saline water, strip-mining, deep tillage, there is an inevitable reduction of species of animals and plants. It can also result in the loss of some components of the soil community, e.g. mycorrhizal fungi, macrobiota such as invertebrates, with a consequent reduction in or a loss of the metabiotic activities of functional groups of the soil biota. Types of metabiotic action include facilitation, ecological engineering, commensalism and keystone predation. Metabiosis must rank with biotic interrelationships and interactions, such as competition, predation or mutualism, in its effects upon soil communities and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Introduction Mycorrhizal fungi play a central role in biogeochemical cycles since they obtain carbon from their photosynthetic plant hosts and allocate this via their mycelia to the soil ecosystem. The mycelia interact with a range of organic and inorganic substrates, as well as with different organisms such as bacteria, fungi, soil micro-and meso-fauna and the roots of secondary hosts or non-host plants. Some of the carbon allocated to the mycelium is used to make compounds such as enzymes, organic acids, siderophores or antibiotics, which influence biotic or abiotic substrates through processes such as decomposition, weathering or antibiosis. Organic and inorganic nutrients mobilized from these substrates can be taken up by the mycorrhizal mycelia and translocated to their plant hosts, influencing plant growth, community structure and vegetation dynamics. Ultimately these changes have further impacts on biogeochemical cycles. Different types of mycorrhizal symbiosis have evolved as adaptations to different suites of edaphic parameters, resulting in the characteristic vegetation types that dominate different terrestrial biomes. Other chapters in this book consider specific contributions of ectomycorrhizal fungi to mineral dissolution (see Wallander, Chapter 14, this volume), carbon and nitrogen cycling (see Hobbie & Wallander, Chapter 5, this volume) and mineral tunnelling (see Smits, Chapter 13, this volume). In this chapter we concentrate on how these activities are integrated and on ways in which ectomycorrhizal hyphae may interact with other microorganisms to influence biogeochemical cycles. {\textcopyright} British Mycological Society 2006.},

abstract = {In the southern part of Korup National Park, Cameroon, nine replicate plots (40 x 80 m) in forest with low abundances (5-15% of the basal area of all trees ≤30 cm gbh [girth at breast height]; LEM) and nine with high abundances (45-68%; HEM) of ectomycorrhizal caesalpiniaceous legumes were selected from an earlier enumeration along an east-west 5-km transect. The codominant caesalps in HEM plots were Microberlinia bisulcata, Tetraberlinia bifoliolata, and T. moreliana, and ordination showed the LEM and HEM plots to be floristically distinct. The HEM plots lay in a large well-defined patch of these caesalps, set within surrounding LEM forest. A further contrast to HEM forest was achieved by selecting six LEM and six VLEM plots (very low, ≃0% ectomycorrhizal trees) on a second transect 12 km to the north. Korup has an annual rainfall of 5180 mm with one very distinct 3-mo dry season (December-February). The soils are sandy, acidic, and very phosphorus poor. The aim was to determine whether LEM and HEM plots differed in their litter and soil phosphorus status and the characteristics of their phosphorus cycles. On 13 occasions between August 1988 and September 1990, litter and soils in the surface root layer and the mineral layer 5 cm below were sampled on the main transect and analyzed for phosphorus fractions. This analysis distinguished between inorganic and organic forms and provided various measures of lability. Nitrogen and carbon contents, pH, and moisture contents of each layer, depth of the root layer, and amounts of litter (i.e., litter mass) and soil were the other main variables. In a subset of plots, leaf litterfall was collected over the period and analyzed for phosphorus and nitrogen, and two litter-bag experiments in early wet seasons estimated rates of litter disappearance. Root biomass and change with depth were estimated from pit samples within the plots. HEM plots had slightly higher mean basal area of trees than LEM plots (32.3 and 27.1 m2/ha, respectively) and higher fine root (≤5 mm diameter) biomasses (519 and 364 g/m2, 0-5 cm), but the same mean litter mass (155 g/m2) and annual leaf litterfall (720 g/m2) and very similar disappearance rates (1.82 g{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}d-1 on litterfall/mass basis; t 1/4 of 53 d from litter bags). Litter mass (and litterfall) reached a clear peak in the mid-dry season in both HEM and LEM plots (slightly earlier in HEM), almost completely disappearing by mid-wet season. The phosphorus concentrations in HEM falling leaf litter was much greater than in LEM (801 and 676 $\mu$g/g) leading to greater inputs (1.79 and 1.35 mg{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}d-1), while for nitrogen the concentrations and inputs were very similar (means 17.8 mg/g, 35.3 mg{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}d-1). An important feature was the marked peak in phosphorus (but not nitrogen) concentration in litter in the HEM plots only in those years that did not follow a mast fruiting. Depth of the root layer was greater in the HEM than LEM plots (8.1 and 4.2 mm), as was carbon content (5.5 and 4.0%), but bulk density was less (0.85 and 1.30 g/cm3). Moisture contents, which tracked the seasons in all three layers, were slightly higher in HEM than LEM, as were clay and silt contents, but pH values were lower (4.19 and 4.59, root layer). The relative differences in the eight soil phosphorus fractions (resin-, bicarbonate- and NaOH-extractable, and chloroform-labile, inorganic, and organic) plus residual and total phosphorus were remarkably consistent between HEM and LEM plots. In the root layer total phosphorus was much higher in HEM than LEM plots (309 and 186 $\mu$g/g, respectively) and likewise in the mineral layer (192 and 119 $\mu$g/g, respectively): HEM/LEM ratios of ≃1.6 were maintained across nearly all fractions. Covariance analysis indicated that the basal areas of LEM and HEM plots could not account for the differences in phosphorus concentrations. Different fractions followed different trends with time, but these did not match seasons and showed, for the more labile inorganic phosphorus fractions especially, a linear decline over the study period. Interactions between forest type and date (split-plot repeated-measures analysis of variance) were rarely significant even though date itself invariably was. In marked contrast, nitrogen fractions did not decline, and lablie organic nitrogen showed clear seasonal peaks. Differences between the LEM forest on the two transects (two occasions in common) were small and inconsistent, supporting the wider contrast with HEM plots. Principal components analysis of the phosphorus and nitrogen fractions showed a strong discrimination between LEM and HEM plots. Calculation with amounts of phosphorus in the top 6 cm of the soil showed very similar patterns to the concentrations. Large ectomycorrhizal trees appeared to have increased the depth of the surface root layer, its phosphorus content, the labile phosphorus fraction (notably its organic component), and to have enhanced phosphorus cycling. The role of ectomycorrhizas in this process is discussed. The decline in labile phosphorus is explained by a phenological and climatic ectomycorrhizal response (PACER) hypothesis that highlights the relationship between phosphorus demand in mast fruiting years and soil phosphorus concentrations. The importance of this in adaptations by ectomycorrhizal caesalps to this strongly seasonal and phosphorus-poor site is considered.},

Roots and mycorrhizae constitute 63 to 70% of total net primary production in Douglas-fir and Pacific silver fir stands. The importance of roots in primary production makes the method of root extraction from the soil important. Wet-sieving with small mesh screens is more effective than hand-sorting for fine roots and mycorrhizae. Screen size, the efficiency of recovery, the physiological status of the roots and coversion factors to derive biomass from the numbers of root tips should be stated. Published data is enhanced if the phenological status of the stand, its age, tree density, and soil texture are quoted. Given the large fluxes in fine root and mycorrhiza populations, single biomass estimates are not useful in studies of ecosystem structure and function. A better understanding needs accurate methods to distinguish live and dead roots, data on the production and turnover of large roots, and data on the transfer of nutrients accompanying the large input of roots to decomposition. {\textcopyright} 1983 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W.

abstract = {In south-central Chile, basal area and wood volume development of Nothofagus spp. in some forests has been shown to be independent of that of associated tree species. Although this has been attributed to the emergent habit of Nothofagus, here we explore the possible role of belowground resource partitioning. We measured fine root biomass and vertical distribution of emergent Nothofagus dombeyi and its canopy associates in an old-growth rain forest, to test for evidence of vertical partitioning of belowground resources. Fine roots were sampled to a depth of 80 cm in three plots. Total fine root biomass averaged 4685 g m-1, N. dombeyi contributing about 22% of this figure. Roots were concentrated mainly in the upper horizons, with 69% of the total occurring at <30 cm. However, fine root biomass of N. dombeyi declined significantly more steeply with depth than that of its associates did, the average contribution of N. dombeyi to total fine root biomass decreasing from 29% in the uppermost 10 cm, to little more than 1% at 70-80 cm. The observed differences in rooting depth could be linked to differences in mycorrhizal syndromes: ectomycorrhizal Nothofagus might be expected to be more shallow-rooted than the VAM and non-mycorrhizal canopy species, because of the reportedly greater ability of ectomycorrhizal species to assimilate organic nitrogen from the litter layer. A degree of belowground resource use complementarity may therefore minimize competition between N. dombeyi and its associates, and could thus contribute to the additive basal area and productivity observed in these forests. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we measured $\delta$ 15N and $\delta$ 13C in needles, litter, soil, wood, fungal caps, and fungal stipes at numerous forested sites in Oregon, USA to determine how functional attributes and biochemical processes may influence isotopic values. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were classified by hydrophobicity of ectomycorrhizae and by patterns of hyphal exploration; saprotrophic fungi were classified into wood decay and litter decay fungi. For $\delta$ 15N, caps of hydrophobic taxa averaged 8.6‰, hydrophilic taxa 3.2‰, and saprotrophic taxa 0.5‰, whereas needles averaged 3‰ and soil at 5-12 cm averaged 2‰ Caps were higher in $\delta$ 15N, $\delta$ 13C, %N, and %C than stipes by 1.7‰, 0.6‰, 1.75%, and 2.61%, respectively, presumably because of greater protein content in caps than stipes. Isotopic enrichment of caps relative to stipes was greater in hydrophobic taxa (3.1‰ for 15N and 0.8‰ for 13C) than in hydrophilic taxa (1.1‰ for 15N and 0.5‰ for 13C). In multiple regressions, 45% of variance in $\delta$ 15N cap-stipe and 30% of variance in $\delta$ 13C cap-stipe was accounted for by various elemental, isotopic, and categorical variables. We estimated that fungal protein was enriched in 15N relative to fungal chitin by 15‰ in hydrophobic taxa and by 7‰ in hydrophilic taxa. Fungal protein was enriched in 13C by 4.2 ± 0.5‰ relative to carbohydrates. Isotopic signatures of sources and isotopic fractionation during metabolic processing influence both isotopic patterns of sporocarps and the isotopic partitioning between caps and stipes; functional groups differed in processing of both nitrogen isotopes and carbon isotopes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Storage of C in forest soils is dependent on plant production rates, allocation of C, decomposition rate of products entering the soil, and stabilization within the soil by aggregation, absorption, and humification. The largest contributions to soil C pools are roots and litter. Estimates of litter are available for many ecosystems, but values for roots and fine-root production are difficult to obtain (Nadelhoffer and Raich, 1992) and pose an obstacle for understanding physiological activities of soil organisms (Zak and Pregitzer, 1998). Litter contributes cellulose, hemicellulose, lignins, pigments, water-soluble sugars, amino acids, aliphatic acids, and alcohol- and ether-soluble constituents including fats, oils, waxes, and resins. While roots contain a number of the same components, they also contribute to the soil C pool by providing, to depth, a diet with rapid turnover of dead tissue, mucilage, and cells sloughed off the growing root tip as it moves through soil (Ulrich et al., 1981). Before roots enter the detrital pool they also contribute root-derived substrates that fuel rhizosphere communities and stimulate the initiation of symbiotic relationships such as mycorrhizae. Regardless of the source, plant materials and the biomass produced from consumption of live plant materials contribute to detrital pools that support the complex food webs that in part regulate C sequestration in soils. {\textcopyright} 2003 by CRC Press LLC.},

abstract = {Tree species associated with different mycorrhizal fungi play a crucial role in the carbon (C) cycling of forest ecosystems, while their effects on soil respiration (RS) and the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. In this study, we used a common garden experiment that included five monocultures (two arbuscular mycorrhizal – (AM) and three ectomycorrhizal-associated (ECM) temperate tree species) to explore the effects of mycorrhizal associations on the RS and the driving factors. Our specific objectives were to (1) compare the RS between the AM and ECM stands, and (2) explore the driving factors of the RS. We found that the RS in the AM stands was significantly greater (34.3%) than that in the ECM stands. The RS was significantly and positively correlated with microbial biomass C (Cmic), fine roots biomass (Broot), or soil water content (W5), but negatively with forest floor mass (Fmass) or soil dissolved organic C content (Cdis). The best-fitted models of RS explained 46.3%, 38.3%, and 45.4% of the variations in the RS for the AM stands, the ECM stands, and the combined dataset, respectively. However, the factors contributing to the RS varied with mycorrhizal groups. The RS of the AM stands was mainly influenced by Cmic, Broot, root C/N ratio, Fmass, and Cdis, whereas the RS of the ECM stands was mainly affected by litter C/N ratio, Cdis, soil dissolved nitrogen content, soil temperature and W5. These findings highlight the significance of shifts in AM or ECM tree abundance due to forest management and global change in forest C cycling. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

A maximum of 53 species was found in the coffee agroforest with highest diversity, exclusive (confined to a specific forest: 42 sp.) and core-group (frequency of occurrence, ≥10%: 17 sp.) species. Irrespective of forest, the species richness attained peaks during June and September. Rarefaction indices of species against sporocarps also showed the highest expected number of species in coffee agroforest. Of a total of 9256 sporocarps, the coffee agroforest consists of highest sporocarps than other forests (3715 vs. 1676—2999). Two-way ANOVA revealed significant spatial difference in richness of species (P < 0.01) as well as sporocarps (P < 0.05) without significant difference temporally. Low species similarity among forests surveyed (2.4—8.5%) depicts uniqueness of macrofungi in these forests. This survey yielded 45 new records to the Western Ghats and 47 economically valuable core-group fungi (edible, medicinal and ectomycorrhizal).

abstract = {Forest soils represent important terrestrial carbon (C) pools where C is primarily fixed in the plant-derived biomass but it flows further through the biomass of fungi and bacteria before it is lost from the ecosystem as CO2 or immobilized in recalcitrant organic matter. Microorganisms are the main drivers of C flow in forests and play critical roles in the C balance through the decomposition of dead biomass of different origins. Here, we track the path of C that enters forest soil by following respiration, microbial biomass production, and C accumulation by individual microbial taxa in soil microcosms upon the addition of 13C-labeled biomass of plant, fungal, and bacterial origin. We demonstrate that both fungi and bacteria are involved in the assimilation and mineralization of C from the major complex sources existing in soil. Decomposer fungi are, however, better suited to utilize plant biomass compounds, whereas the ability to utilize fungal and bacterial biomass is more frequent among bacteria. Due to the ability of microorganisms to recycle microbial biomass, we suggest that the decomposer food web in forest soil displays a network structure with loops between and within individual pools. These results question the present paradigms describing food webs as hierarchical structures with unidirectional flow of C and assumptions about the dominance of fungi in the decomposition of complex organic matter. {\textcopyright} 2018 International Society for Microbial Ecology.},

abstract = {In the strongly seasonal, but annually very wet, parts of the tropics, low-water availability in the short dry season leads to a semi-deciduous forest, one which is also highly susceptible to nutrient loss from leaching in the long wet season. Patterns in litterfall were compared between forest with low (LEM) and high (HEM) abundances of ectomycorrhizal trees in Korup National Park, Cameroon, over 26 months in 1990-92. Leaf litter was sorted into 26 abundant species which included 6 ectomycorrhizal species, and of these 3 were the large grove-forming trees Microberlinia bisulcata, Tetraberlinia bifoliolata and Tetraberlinia moreliana. Larger-tree species shed their leaves with pronounced peaks in the dry season, whereas other species had either weaker dependence, showed several peaks per year, or were wet-season shedders. Although total annual litterfall differed little between forest types, in the HEM forest (dominated by M. bisulcata) the dry-season peak was more pronounced and earlier than that in the LEM forest. Species differed greatly in their mean leaf litterfall nutrient concentrations, with an approx. 2-fold range for nitrogen and phosphorus, and 2.5-3.5-fold for potassium, magnesium and calcium. In the dry season, LEM and HEM litter showed similar declines in P and N concentration, and increases in K and Mg; some species, especially M. bisculcata, showed strong dry-wet season differences. The concentration of P (but not N) was higher in the leaf litter of ectomycorrhizal than non-ectomycorrhizal species. Retranslocation of N and P was lower among the ectomycorrhizal than non-ectomycorrhizal species by approx. 2-fold. It is suggested that within ectomycorrhizal groves on this soil low in P, a fast decomposition rate with minimal loss of mineralized P is possible due to the relatively high litter P not limiting the cycle at this stage, combined with an efficient recapture of released P by the surface organic layer of ectomycorrhizas and fine roots. This points to a feedback between 2 essential controlling steps (retranslocation and mineralization) in a tropical rain forest ecosystem dominated by ectomycorrhizal trees.},

abstract = {The dominance of ectomycorrhizae in most coniferous forest ecosystems profoundly alters the classical concept of the role of exudation and rhizodeposition of cell fragments in the formation of the rhizosphere. In the unaltered, non-ectomycorrhizal rhizosphere the soluble exudates and sloughed cells supporting higher populations of bacteria and other soil biota in the rhizosphere result from the root. The loss of root hairs and the presence of a sheath of fungal hyphae around roots in ectomycorrhizae, suggests that the exudates and sloughed cells will be mainly fungal in origin, creating a mycorrhizosphere. Unfortunately, very little quantitative data exist to test this hypothesis. Recent work has shown that much of the rhizodeposition is in fact whole roots and mycorrhizae; soluble exudates and root cap plus mucigel account for only 3-15% of the organic matter produced in pot experiments. In forests, 3-5 times more organic matter in the form of roots and mycorrhizae is returned to the soil than is returned by decomposition of litter. Data on biomass of bacteria, fungi and other mycorrhizosphere biota obtained by direct measurement or observation are very limited. Much of the research on interactions among biota has focused on host-pathogen interactions rather than quantification of the impact of biota on ecosystem processes. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {The interactions of fungal guilds have recently been proposed as drivers of organic matter transformation in forest soils. We conducted a pot experiment with Norway spruce seedlings planted in spruce needle litter inoculated with several fungal strains belonging to different ecological guilds (saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, and root endophytic) to assess how the fungi and their interactions affect the transformation of humic substances (HS) and phosphorus (P) in the litter. Several methods for the characterization of P forms and HS were employed, including 31P NMR, UV–Vis and FTIR spectroscopy. Our results show that fungal interactions influence not only the flow of P in decaying (plant) litter but also the transformation of the soil organic matter itself. Pots with saprotrophic Gymnopus androsaceus generally retained more P and prevented the accumulation of phosphonates caused by mycorrhizal Hyaloscypha finlandica, highlighting the strong competitive ability of the former species. The increased mineralization of P caused by G. androsaceus was not observed in the combined treatments, suggesting that other present fungi took up part of the inorganic P. The tested fungi did not affect the amount of HS produced but changed the characteristics of the HS. Mycorrhizal H. finlandica and root endophytic Phialocephala fortinii increased the relative proportion of carboxylic moieties in the HS regardless of the presence or absence of G. androsaceus, probably via the production and incorporation of melanins. The UV–Vis absorbance characteristics of the HS were significantly influenced by fungal interactions. Mycorrhizal H. finlandica and Hebeloma bryogenes retarded humification, as determined by the A4/6 ratio. We attribute the similar shift observed in Serpula himantoides to the partial oxidative degradation of HS. Our study shows that fungal root endophytes can significantly contribute to litter transformation along with mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi. The extent and patterns of the transformation seem to be species-dependent in all studied fungal groups. {\textcopyright} 2020},

abstract = {In many forest ecosystems, fine root litter comprises a large pool of organic carbon and nutrients. In temperate climates ectomycorrhizal fungi colonize the roots of many forest plant species. If ectomycorrhizal colonization influenced root decomposition, it could significantly influence carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. Fungal tissues and fine roots may decompose at different rates and, therefore, ectomycorrhizal colonization may either hasten or retard root decomposition. Unfortunately, no comparisons of the decomposition of roots and ectomycorrhizal fungi have yet been made. Therefore, we compared decomposition of Pinus resinosa fine roots and ectomycorrhizal fungi from a Pinus resinosa plantation. We also compared the decomposition rates of nonmycorrhizal Pinus resinosa fine roots with roots colonized by nine species of ectomycorrhizal fungi. We found that the several tested isolates of ectomycorrhizal fungi decomposed far more rapidly than the fine roots and that ectomycorrhizal colonization either had no significant effect on root decomposition or significantly increased root decomposition depending on the isolate of fungus. We conclude that the composition of an ectomycorrhizal fungal community may affect carbon and nutrient cycling through its influence on root decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

trait-decomposition linkage, and especially its dependence on
mycorrhizal type and environmental context, remains limited. We explored
the control of morphological and chemical (carbon- and nutrient-related)
traits over decomposition of absorptive roots in 30 tree species

Carbon-related traits (acid-unhydrolysable residue (AUR) and cellulose
concentrations) had predominant control of root decomposition in AM
species while nutrient-related traits (magnesium concentration)
predominately controlled that in ECM species. Thicker absorptive roots
decomposed faster in AM species as a result of their lower AUR
concentrations, but more slowly in ECM angiosperm species potentially as
a result of their higher magnesium concentrations. Root decomposition
was linked to root nutrient economy in both forests while root
diameter-decomposition coordination emerged only in the subtropical
forest where root diameter and decomposition presented similar
cross-species variations. Our findings suggest that root
trait-decomposition linkages differ strongly with mycorrhizal type and
environment, and that root diameter can predict decomposition but in
opposing directions and with contrasting mechanisms for AM and ECM

We measured $\delta$15N in many components of the Franz Josef soil chronosequence in New Zealand to see how each component varied along the sequence and within sites, and to see what this variation can tell us about how ecosystem processes such as N losses change with soil age. We analyzed $\delta$15N in foliage from 18 woody species, abscised leaves from seven woody species, three soil horizons, bryophytes, lichens, bulk deposition, and nodules from the N-fixing tree Coriaria arborea (Coriariaceae). Foliar $\delta$15N varied significantly across plant species. Foliage and bulk litter became 15N-depleted as soil age increased. Soil N from organic and mineral horizons was significantly more 15N-enriched than bulk litter N at each site. Increasing precipitation also decreased foliar and soil $\delta$15N. Comparing input and whole ecosystem $\delta$15N revealed limited evidence for net fractionation during N losses. These trends are consistent with some combination of increasing fractionation during plant N uptake, mycorrhizal transfer, within-plant processing, and soil decomposition as soils age. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

Fungi that colonize the sclerotia appear to affect sclerotia viability and may play an important role in the life history of Cenococcum. Some of the fungi could also affect nutrient cycling by decomposing Cenococcum sclerotia, which are melanized and recalcitrant to decay. We used a culture-based method to document the fungal communities growing inside surface-sterilized sclerotia that were collected from forest soils. Cenococcum was successfully isolated from 297 of 971 sclerotia whereas 427 sclerotia hosted fungi other than Cenococcum. DNA barcoding of the internal transcribed spacer rDNA followed by grouping at 97% sequence similarity yielded 85 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that consisted primarily of Ascomycota (e.g. Chaetothyriales, Eurotiales, Helotiales, Pleosporales) and a few Basidiomycota and Mucoromycotina. Although most fungal OTUs were infrequently cultured, several OTUs such as members of Asterostroma, Cladophialophora, Oidiodendron, and Pleosporales were common and found across many sites. Our results suggest that Cenococcum sclerotia act as a substrate for diverse fungi. The occurrence of several OTUs in sclerotia across many sites suggests that these fungi may be active parasites of Cenococcum sclerotia or may preferentially use sclerotia as a nutrient source. {\textcopyright} 2014 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

However, the patterns and key driving factors of soil enzyme activities and stoichiometry in subalpine forests, which are areas sensitive to global changes, remain unclear. In this study, rhizosphere and bulk soils along two environmental gradients in the subalpine forests of Gongga Mountain, in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, including (1) a horizontal chronosequence with different vegetation types but a similar climate and (2) a vertical elevation gradient with the same vegetation type but different climates, were sampled during the growing and nongrowing seasons. The activities and stoichiometry of soil enzymes related to the microbial acquisition of carbon (C) ($\beta$-1,4-glucosidase, BG), nitrogen (N) ($\beta$-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, NAG) and phosphorus (P) (acid phosphomonoesterase, AP) were analyzed to reveal their responses to environmental gradients. The results showed that enzyme activities and stoichiometry varied significantly among vegetation types, but were less affected by climate and root proximity. BG activity and ratios of BG to nutrient-acquiring enzymes were significantly higher in broadleaf forests than in coniferous forests. The differences in enzyme stoichiometry between vegetation types were weakly related to the microbial nutrient status (represented by the ratio of soil to microbial element stoichiometry) but might be explained by the higher proportion of ectomycorrhizal fungi in coniferous forests compared to broadleaf forests. The results of this study indicate that vegetation type was a major factor regulating soil enzyme activities and stoichiometry in the subalpine forests, possibly via its influences on plant-associated microbial communities. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Understanding the ecology of coniferous forests is very important because these environments represent globally largest carbon sinks. Metatranscriptomics, microbial community and enzyme analyses were combined to describe the detailed role of microbial taxa in the functioning of the Picea abies-dominated coniferous forest soil in two contrasting seasons. These seasons were the summer, representing the peak of plant photosynthetic activity, and late winter, after an extended period with no photosynthate input. The results show that microbial communities were characterized by a high activity of fungi especially in litter where their contribution to microbial transcription was over 50%. Differences in abundance between summer and winter were recorded for 26-33% of bacterial genera and <15% of fungal genera, but the transcript profiles of fungi, archaea and most bacterial phyla were significantly different among seasons. Further, the seasonal differences were larger in soil than in litter. Most importantly, fungal contribution to total microbial transcription in soil decreased from 33% in summer to 16% in winter. In particular, the activity of the abundant ectomycorrhizal fungi was reduced in winter, which indicates that plant photosynthetic production was likely one of the major drivers of changes in the functioning of microbial communities in this coniferous forest. {\textcopyright} 2016 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Tree growth in boreal forests is limited by nitrogen (N) availability. Most boreal forest trees form symbiotic associations with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which improve the uptake of inorganic N and also have the capacity to decompose soil organic matter (SOM) and to mobilize organic N (‘ECM decomposition'). To study the effects of ‘ECM decomposition' on ecosystem carbon (C) and N balances, we performed a sensitivity analysis on a model of C and N flows between plants, SOM, saprotrophs, ECM fungi, and inorganic N stores. The analysis indicates that C and N balances were sensitive to model parameters regulating ECM biomass and decomposition. Under low N availability, the optimal C allocation to ECM fungi, above which the symbiosis switches from mutualism to parasitism, increases with increasing relative involvement of ECM fungi in SOM decomposition. Under low N conditions, increased ECM organic N mining promotes tree growth but decreases soil C storage, leading to a negative correlation between C stores above- and below-ground. The interplay between plant production and soil C storage is sensitive to the partitioning of decomposition between ECM fungi and saprotrophs. Better understanding of interactions between functional guilds of soil fungi may significantly improve predictions of ecosystem responses to environmental change. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

abstract = {Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) is the chief coniferous species used in forest plantations in northern China. However, high tree density and slow rates of decomposition in needle litter have resulted in decreased quality in many plantations. Thinning provides an effective method which can be used to solve this problem. The mechanisms by which thinning promotes litter decomposition have been studied by studying properties of litter, characteristics of understory vegetation, forest microclimate and physicochemical properties of soil, but rarely by studying the important role fungi play in forest litter decomposition. Thus, discovering the relationships between thinning, fungi, and litter decomposition in plantations is very important. It has been hypothesized that forest microclimates improve after thinning, since thinning promotes growth of understory vegetation; this changes stand composition and properties of litter, which in turn affects the macrofungi community. This study analyzes a series of 34-year-old Chinese pine plantations thinned to four different intensities (control-I, light-II, medium-III, and heavy thinning intensity-IV). All macrofungi were identified morphologically and measurements of each species such as quantity, cap diameter and fungal height were made in 12 sample plots. Importance values were calculated using relative density, relative frequency, relative cap diameter and relative height of fungi. The ecological indices (species richness, diversity and evenness) of macrofungi were calculated based on the important values and compared between August and September, 2011. A total of 35 and 25 species belonging to 13 and 10 families of macrofungi were found in August and September, respectively. During the two months of studies, stands with medium thinning intensity supported the highest number of species, but the control stand supported the fewest. The number of species found in September was lower than those found in August possibly because the temperature decreased in September. In the control-I stands, the dominant species changed from ectomycorrhizal fungi (Chroogomphis rutilus (Schaeff.: Fr.) O. K. Miller and Suillus bovinus (Pers.) Kuntze) in August to rot fungi (Marasmius maximus Hongo and Marasmius chordalis Fr.) in September. This change may have occurred because ectomycorrhizal fungi reproduce during August, but they rarely grew in September. However, in treatments II, III and IV, the dominant species were rot fungi during the entire study. Rot fungi are generally known to feed on litter as a nutrient source. Thus, the change of dominant species from ectomycorrhizal fungi-rot fungi (control) to rot fungi (treatment II, III and IV) may be explained by the fact thinning improves litter decomposition from the aspect of causing increased fungal populations. Thinning influenced the ecological indices of macrofungi; the stands with medium thinning intensity (III) had the highest species richness and diversity. This indicates moderate thinning had a significant role in protecting macrofungi resources in plantation soils. The measure of species evenness was not significantly different among the four different thinning intensities. The abundant quantity of saprophytic fungi might cause the trend for the evenness indices to be uniform. In conclusion, a medium thinning intensity improves species richness and diversity of macrofungi in Chinese pine plantations, changes the macrofungi community structure, and may promote litter decomposition. Thus, we recommend moderate thinning should be used in plantations of Chinese pine.},

The identification of ECM fungi in small environmental samples is difficult. The present study tested the feasibility of attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy followed by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) to discriminate in situ collected ECM fungal species. Root tips colonized by distinct ECM fungal species, i.e., Amanita rubescens, Cenococcum geophilum, Lactarius subdulcis, Russula ochroleuca, and Xerocomus pruinatus were collected in mono-specific beech (Fagus sylvatica) and mixed deciduous forests in different geographic areas to investigate the environmental variability of the ECM FTIR signatures. A clear HCA discrimination was obtained for ECM fungal species independent of individual provenance. Environmental variability neither limited the discrimination between fungal species nor provided sufficient resolution to discern species sub-clusters for different sites. However, the de-convoluted FTIR spectra contained site-related spectral information for fungi with wide nutrient ranges, but not for Lactarius subdulcis, a fungus residing only in the litter layer. Specific markers for distinct ECM were identified in spectral regions associated with carbohydrates (i.e., mannans), lipids, and secondary protein structures. The present results support that FTIR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate analysis is a reliable and fast method to identify ECM fungal species in minute environmental samples. Moreover, our data suggest that the FTIR spectral signatures contain information on physiological and functional traits of ECM fungi. {\textcopyright} 2014 Pena, Lang, Naumann and Polle.},

Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) was used to determine the presence of root fungi and standard fluorometric analysis was used to determine soil enzyme activities. Soil enzymes were consistently positively correlated with soil C and N, but not CN ratio. Soil P was also correlated with enzyme activity during both June and September sampling. We saw no significant relationships between herbaceous plant cover and enzyme activity in June, but there were significant positive correlations between $\alpha$-glucosidase and herbaceous plant coverage in September. We also found that some enzymes were significantly correlated with the identity of fungi colonizing tree roots separated from the soil cores. Chitinase and $\beta$-glucosidase were positively correlated with the genera Russula and Piloderma while chitinase was negatively correlated with Amanita and Entoloma. In addition, phosphatase was positively correlated with Russula, Meliniomyces and Solenopezia.

abstract = {Survival and productivity of Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] depend on close association between host trees and ectomycorrhizal fungi. Two of these fungi, Hysterangium setchellii (Fischer) and Gautieria monticola (Harkness), form extensive hyphal mats with the roots of Douglas-fir and other conifers in the surface of the 'A' horizon, often at the interface between mineral oil and litter. The fungal mat alters the chemistry and mineral nutrition of the soil microenvironment within the rhizosphere, producing conditions that favor increased tree growth by increasing nutrient availability. Forest soils with or without obvious ectomycorrhizal mats were sampled at two locations in the Pacific Northwest. Cation and anion chemistry, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and oxalate anions were analyzed. Mean concentrations of DOC, oxalate, PO4, SO4, H, Al, Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn were significantly higher in mat than in non-mat soil solutions in both mat types and locations and on both sampling dates. Significant statistical correlations between DOC or oxalate and PO4 indicate that organic acids influence weathering and solubility of PO4 in the mat soils. Mean oxalate concentrations were significantly lower in soil solutions from Hysterangium mat soils than in those from Gautieria mat soils. Organic acids released to the rhizosphere by G. monilcola and H. setchellii may provide a local weathering environment that increases availability of PO4, SO4 and trace nutrients. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Clearcut logging results in major changes in ectomycorrhizal fungal communities, but whether this results in the loss of key functional traits, such as those associated with nutrient acquisition from soil organic matter, is unknown. Furthermore, little is known about the importance of resource partitioning in structuring ectomycorrhizal fungal communities following disturbance because most research on these communities has focussed on life history strategies. By studying functional traits, such as activities of enzymes involved in the catabolism of organic macromolecules in soil, we can determine whether a physiological potential for resource partitioning exists in pioneer ectomycorrhizal communities and whether severe disturbance affects these important ecosystem services. We used activities of key hydrolytic enzymes in the ectomycorrhizospheres of Douglas-fir seedlings regenerating at clearcut sites as a functional trait to test whether these differed from those at recent wildfire sites or control forests. We sampled the most abundant types of ectomycorrhizas from 16-month-old seedlings from sites exposed to (i) low or (ii) high severity wildfire, (iii) sites that had been clearcut logged in the same year as the fire and (iv) sites that contained control stands of mature Douglas-fir. We expected differences in activities among ectomycorrhizas sampled from different disturbance treatments and among those formed by different fungal species. In spite of large differences in soil chemistry, activities of acid phosphomonoesterase, N-acetylglucosaminidase and $\beta$-glucosidase, when averaged among the ectomycorrhizas sampled per site, were not affected by disturbance agent. However, activities varied up to sixfold among mycorrhizospheres of different fungal species on the same seedling. Multivariate analysis also indicated some consistent differences in enzyme profiles among ectomycorrhizas formed by specific fungal species, independent of treatment. The finding that ectomycorrhizal fungal communities exposed to different disturbance agents are functionally similar with respect to the activities of three mycorrhizosphere enzymes supports the conclusion that complementarity exists among ectomycorrhizal fungi. The substantial physiological diversity among ectomycorrhizal fungi at the scale of an individual seedling's root tips, especially at control mature forests, indicates the potential for resource partitioning within the ectomycorrhizal community and access to a wider range of nutrient sources by each seedling. Functional similarity among ectomycorrhizal fungal communities across a disturbance severity gradient suggests that dry interior Douglas-fir forests are resilient to severe disturbances such as high severity wildfire and clearcutting with forest floor removal. Moreover, our results suggest that current harvesting practices emulate natural disturbances with respect to site-level mycorrhizosphere enzyme activity. The large variation in activity among fungal species, however, indicates that a substantial simplification of the fungal community through other perturbations, as expected with climate change, has the potential to affect ecosystem function. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

For decades, the paradigm has been that the biomass of fine roots of trees turns over several times a year, which together with large inputs of above-ground litter leaves little room for the contribution from root respiration. Here, we combine the results of a recent tree girdling experiment with the C budget of the classic Swedish Coniferous Forest (SWECON) project, in which root growth and turnover were estimated to be high. We observe that such a high rate of root turnover requires an unlikely high C use efficiency for root growth, and is not consistent with the 1:1 relation between root: heterotrophic respiration obtained in the girdling experiment. Our analysis suggests that 75% of the C allocated to roots is respired, while 25% is used for growth, and hence that root growth and turnover were grossly overestimated in the SWECON study.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors that structure soil microbial communities and their relative importance in determining local community assemblages is fundamental to understanding how human activities, such as forest management, may impact soil ecosystems. We studied fungal communities in soil and litter under multiple sites dominated by spruce, beech and oak in a central European forest ecosystem to further understand the relative importance of vegetation and abiotic variables within a temperate forest. We sampled four times over a one-year period to determine if fungal community composition varied over time and whether the determination of driving factors was temporally dependent. We found that fungal community composition differed between litter and soil and among stand types but that community structure (richness, functional-guilds) was similar. In litter communities, composition was strongly coupled to dominant tree species; while in soil communities, both dominant tree and abiotic variables such as pH were important - with each variable explaining a separable portion of the variation in the fungal community composition. Further analyses showed that the relative importance of dominant tree species and abiotic drivers differed among functional groups subsets of the community. Across our sampled sites, both the litter and soil communities of a given stand type were well-characterized by a set of low-abundance indicator species with consistent presence, regardless of location, suggesting stand type is an important local filter on the occurrence of these taxa within the spatial context of our study (100 km2). The marked difference in annual leaf break and leaf fall between coniferous and deciduous stands were not found to correlate with temporal changes in fungal community composition; however, a time-dependent trend was found across all soil communities and among all soil functional-group subsets regardless of the dominant tree type. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Although soil microorganisms play a critical role in soil organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling and ecosystem productivity, we still know very little about how microbial communities are affected by environmental factors and how the structure and function of soil microbial communities influence key soil processes, especially for the arid and semi-arid river valley district. Studies focusing on soil microbial communities under this region are still under-represented when compared to moist forest and grassland ecosystems. Thus, the objectives of this work were to quantify the effects of shrubs on soil physicochemical properties and microbial composition (Phospholipid fatty acid, PLFA), and to find out soil factors that significantly affect soil microbial composition. To achieve this, we investigated the variations of soil properties between dominant shrubs and shrub-interspaces at a set of sites along the mountainous semi-arid valley of the upper Minjiang River, Sichuan Province. The dominant shrubs had significant effects on soil physicochemical properties and microbial composition, while the effects of shrub species seem to be trivial. The soil under shrub canopies had more organic carbon and nutrient resources, higher water content and lower bulk density than those of the shrub-interspaces. The bacterial communities' abundance did not vary significantly between the two types of soil, while fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) tended to dominate under shrubs. Furthermore, the correlation based Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated a clear dissimilarity of microbial community composition and physicochemical properties between shrub and shrub-interspace soils. Besides, the PCA revealed that the microbial community composition was a more sensitive and effective indicator than soil physiochemical properties in this study. Backward selection procedure and the combined redundancy analysis (RDA) were used to select the most important soil physiochemical variables affecting soil microbial communities. Though the main factors varied among the four sites, the nitrogen (N) associated factors (Total N, Available N and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio) always played a pivotal role in structuring the microbial groups, especially total microbial biomass (total PLFA) and the bacterial groups (Gran-positive (G+), Gran-negative (G−), general bacteria (B), and cyclo bacteria (cyclo)). The correlation between fungi groups (fungi, AMF) and N associated factors was relatively weak. Total phosphorus and carbon-to-phosphorus ratio strongly affected the fungi and AMF groups in Feihong and Mutuo. This may indicate the importance of phosphorus in shaping fungi and AMF communities, as well as the indispensable role that fungi and AMF communities may play in influencing phosphorus availability and cycling. In addition, soil water content exerted effects on the microbial composition in the two relative humid sites, Cuoji and Mutuo. Moreover, pH did not significantly affect microbial communities, though previous studies have pointed out its important role in affecting microbial composition. This may be due to the small variation of pH in this semi-arid river valley. Collectively, the enrichment of soil nutrients and better physical condition under shrub canopies were the main reasons for the difference of microbial community composition between shrubs and shrub-interspaces. Our work demonstrated the important role of shrubs in the semi-arid valley of upper Minjiang River, and provided insights into the nutrient cycling of semi-arid valley. It also revealed the importance of nitrogen and phosphorus for bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. Future studies on the plant-soil relationship in dryland ecosystems should pay more attention to fungi and AMF communities. {\textcopyright} 2015, Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Boreal forests are distributed in a circumpolar belt between the temperate broadleaf forests to the south and the arctic tundra to the north. Ultimately, boreal forests were shaped by the recent glaciation, with young soils on magmatic bedrock, in combination with short growing seasons and a cold climate. Low temperatures, combined with generally acidic soils, leads to slow decomposition of organic matter and low rates of nitrogen input via fixation. The resulting accumulation of nutrients in organic soil pools restricts recirculation to plants, and ecosystem production is generally constrained by low nitrogen availability. A complete dependency of boreal forest on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associates is supported by the observation that, in habitats where harsh conditions constrain the proliferation of cord-forming ECM fungi, forests gradually retrogress into low-productive ecosystems that more resemble heathlands than forests. The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis expands the boundaries for boreal forest by facilitating establishment in habitats that otherwise would be heathland or tundra. {\textcopyright} 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

abstract = {Introduction Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) form symbioses with forest trees. These fungi are mainly basidiomycetes and ascomycetes and they probably evolved from saprotrophic fungi when organic matter began to accumulate in certain soils 200 million years ago (Cairney, 2000). The tree host benefits from the symbiosis through improved nutrient acquisition since the fungus explores the soil efficiently for nutrients (especially N and P) in return for host carbon (Smith & Read, 1997). Forest trees with ectomycorrhiza usually dominate in acidic soils with thick litter layers, with the associated EMF forming extensive external mycelia with a high capacity to take up nutrients from the soil. The fungi form mantles around the root tips with large storage capacities (Read, 1991). The trees invest large amounts of carbon in the ectomycorrhizal (EM) symbionts, especially under nutrient-poor conditions, with up to 20%of photosynthetic assimilates allocated to the mycorrhizal symbionts (Finlay & S{\"{o}}derstr{\"{o}}m, 1992). This large carbon source for EMF gives them an advantage over nonsymbiotic microorganisms in the soil ecosystem since these are usually carbon-limited (Ald{\'{e}}n et al., 2001). The importance of current photosynthate for soil processes was recently demonstrated by H{\"{o}}gberg et al. (2001), who girdled trees in northern Sweden and found a rapid reduction in soil respiration of more than 50% within 1-2 months. More precise calculations the second year after girdling demonstrated that 65% of total respiration was contributed by EM roots, their associated EMF and other rhizosphere microorganisms (Bhupinderpal-Singh et al., 2003).

abstract = {Plant growth in boreal forests is commonly limited by a low supply of nitrogen, a condition that may be aggravated by high tree below-ground allocation of carbon to ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi and associated microorganisms. These in turn immobilise N and reduce its availability to plants as boreal ecosystems develop. Here, we studied a boreal forest ecosystem chronosequence created by new land rising out of the sea due to iso-static rebound along the coast of northern Sweden. We used height over the ocean to estimate ecosystem age and examined its relationship to soil microbial community structure and the gross turnover of N. The youngest soils develop with meadows by the coast, followed by a zone of N2-fixing alder trees, and primary boreal conifer forest on ground up to 560 years old. The young soils in meadows contained little organic matter and microbial biomass per unit area. Nitrogen was turned over at low rates when expressed per area (m-2), but specific rates (per gram soil carbon (C)) were the highest found along the transect. In the zone with alder, the amounts of soil C and microbial biomass were much higher (bacterial biomass had doubled and fungal biomass quadrupled). Rates of gross N mineralisation (expressed on an area basis) were highest, but the retention of added labelled NH4+ was lowest in this soil as compared to other ages. The alder zone also had the largest extractable pools of inorganic N in soil and highest N % in plant foliage. In the older conifer forest ecosystems the amounts of soil C and N, as well as biomass of both bacteria and fungi increased. Data on organic matter 14C suggested that the largest input of recently fixed plant C occurred in the younger coniferous forest ecosystems. With increasing ecosystem age, the ratio of microbial C to total soil C was constant, whereas the ratio of microbial N to total soil N increased and gross N mineralization declined. Simultaneously, plant foliar N % decreased and the natural abundance of 15N in the soil increased. More specifically, the difference in $\delta$15N between plant foliage and soil increased, which is related to relatively greater retention of 15N relative to 14N by ECM fungi as N is taken up from the soil and some N is transferred to the plant host. In the conifer forest, where these changes were greatest, we found increased fungal biomass in the F- and H-horizons of the mor-layer, in which ECM fungi are known to dominate (the uppermost horizon with litter and moss is dominated by saprotrophic fungi). Hence, we propose that the decreasing availability of N to the plants and the subsequent decline in plant production in ageing boreal forests is linked to high tree belowground C allocation to ECM fungi, a strong microbial sink for available soil N. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.},

abstract = {Quantifying pathways and temporal dynamics of carbon (C) flux between plants and soil is critical to our understanding of the long-term fate of C stored in soils. The potential priming of old organic matter decomposition by fresh C input from plants means that the impact of environmental changes on the interactions between plant C allocation and soil C storage need to be better understood. We used forest girdling to investigate the partitioning of total soil CO2 efflux (RS) into autotrophic (RA) and heterotrophic (RH) flux components and their interaction with litter decomposition. The reduction in RS in girdled plots stabilized within two weeks at 65% of control plot values, indicating that RS is dominated by RH, and that only a small pool of available non-structural C remains in roots in late summer to sustain rhizosphere metabolic processes. RA contributions declined from 35% late in the growing season to about 25% in winter. Our results indicate that actual root respiration (RR) and respiration by ectyomycorrhizas and other rhizospheric organisms (RM) contribute c. 50% each to RA between September and early November. During winter, RA remained significantly greater than zero despite frequent sub-zero air temperatures, with RM being a dominant component of RA during this period. Forest girdling significantly increased the age of C in soil-respired CO2, consistent with the removal of contemporary C derived from RA. Partitioning of soil CO2 efflux on the basis of 14C results shows good agreement with the flux reduction observed between girdled and control plots. Litter bag incubations indicate a promoting influence of an intact C supply to the rhizosphere on decomposition, indicating a positive rhizosphere priming effect. Synthesis: Our results demonstrate significant contribution of mycorrhizas and other rhizosphere organisms to RS, and suggest a direct link between an intact rhizosphere and litter decomposition dynamics. These results highlight the tight coupling between autotroph activity and soil decomposition processes in forest soils, and add to the growing body of evidence that plant and soil processes cannot be treated separately. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Three different approaches were used to calculate heterotrophic soil respiration (Rh) and soil carbon dynamics in an old-growth deciduous forest in central Germany. A root and mycorrhiza exclosure experiment in the field separated auto- and heterotrophic soil respiration. It was compared to modeled heterotrophic respiration resulting from two different approaches: a modular component model of soil respiration calculated autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration with litter, climate and canopy photosynthesis as input variables. It was calibrated by independent soil respiration measurements in the field. A second model was calibrated by incubation of soil samples from different soil layers in the laboratory. In this case, the annual sum of Rh was calculated by an empirical model including response curves to temperature and a soil moisture. The three approaches showed good accordance during spring and summer and when the annual sums of Rh calculated by the two models were compared. Average Rh for the years 2002-2006 were 436 g C m-2 year-1 (field model) and 417 g C m-2 year-1 (lab-model), respectively. Differences between the approaches revealed specific limitations of each method. The average carbon balance of the Hainich forest soil was estimated to be between 1 and 35 g C m-2 year-1 depending on the model used and the averaging period. A comparison with nighttime data from eddy covariance (EC) showed that EC data were lower than modelled soil respiration in many situations. We conclude that better filter methods for EC nighttime data have to be developed. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Basidiomycete fungi subsist on various types of plant material in diverse environments, from living and dead trees and forest litter to crops and grasses and to decaying plant matter in soils. Due to the variation in their natural carbon sources, basidiomycetes have highly varied plant-polysaccharide-degrading capabilities. This topic is not as well studied for basidiomycetes as for ascomycete fungi, which are the main sources of knowledge on fungal plant polysaccharide degradation. Research on plant-biomass-decaying fungi has focused on isolating enzymes for current and future applications, such as for the production of fuels, the food industry, and waste treatment. More recently, genomic studies of basidiomycete fungi have provided a profound view of the plant-bio-mass-degrading potential of wood-rotting, litter-decomposing, plant-pathogenic, and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) basidiomycetes. This review summarizes the current knowledge on plant polysaccharide depolymerization by basidiomycete species from diverse habitats. In addition, these data are compared to those for the most broadly studied ascomycete genus, Aspergillus, to provide insight into specific features of basidiomycetes with respect to plant polysaccharide degradation.

Major biogeochemical losses occur as a result of surface runoff which transports topsoil and leaf litter into streams, and through denitrification. Major nutrient exchanges occur as a result of throughfall and stemflow, litterfall, litter decomposition and nutrient incorporation into plant biomass. Nutrient conserving mechanisms include translocation of nutrients, foliar uptake, uptake by tree and leaf epiphytes, development of aerial roots, large root masses and the presence of mycorrhizal hyphae close to or amongst decomposing litter. Logging, storms, forest clearing and burning can also affect nutrient cycling.

abstract = {Interactions between symbiotic ectomycorrhizal (EM) and free-living saprotrophs can result in significant deceleration of leaf litter decomposition. While this phenomenon is widely cited, its generality remains unclear, as both the direction and magnitude of EM fungal effects on leaf litter decomposition have been shown to vary among studies. Here we explicitly examine how contrasting leaf litter types and EM fungal communities may lead to differential effects on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Specifically, we measured the response of soil nutrient cycling, litter decay rates, litter chemistry and fungal community structure to the reduction of EM fungi (via trenching) with a reciprocal litter transplant experiment in adjacent Pinus- or Quercus-dominated sites. We found clear evidence of EM fungal suppression of C and N cycling in the Pinus-dominated site, but no suppression in the Quercus-dominated site. Additionally, in the Pinus-dominated site, only the Pinus litter decay rates were decelerated by EM fungi and were associated with decoupling of litter C and N cycling. Our results support the hypothesis that EM fungi can decelerate C cycling via N competition, but strongly suggest that the ‘Gadgil effect' is dependent on both substrate quality and EM fungal community composition. We argue that understanding tree host traits as well as EM fungal functional diversity is critical to a more mechanistic understanding of how EM fungi mediate forest soil biogeochemical cycling. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

abstract = {Current theory expects that fungi, on the one hand, are spatially ubiquitous but, on the other, are more susceptible than bacteria to disturbance such as land use change due to dispersal limitations. This study examined the relative importance of location and land use effects in determining soil fungal community composition in south-eastern Australia. We use terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP; primer pair ITS1-F-ITS4) and multivariate statistical methods (NMDS ordinations, ANOSIM tests) to compare relative similarities of soil fungal communities from nine sites encompassing three locations (ca 50-200 km apart) and four land uses (native eucalypt forest, Pinus radiata plantation, Eucalyptus globulus plantation, and unimproved pasture). Location effects were generally weak (e.g. ANOSIM test statistic R ≤ 0.49) and were, in part, attributed to minor differences in soil texture. By contrast, we found clear and consistent evidence of land use effects on soil fungal community composition (R ≤ 0.95). That is, soils from sites of the same land use grouped together in NMDS ordinations of fungal composition despite geographic separations of up to ca 175 km (native eucalypt forests) and 215 km (P. radiata plantations). In addition, different land uses from the same location were clearly separate in NMDS ordinations, despite, in one case, being just 180 m apart and having similar land use histories (i.e. P. radiata versus E. globulus plantation both established on pasture in the previous decade). Given negligible management of all sites beyond the early establishment phase, we attribute much of the land use effects to changes in dominant plant species based on consistent evidence elsewhere of strong specificity in pine and eucalypt mycorrhizal associations. In addition, weak to moderate correlations between soil fungal community composition and soil chemical variables (e.g. Spearman rank correlation coefficients for individual variables of 0.08-0.32), indicated a minor contributing role of vegetation-mediated changes in litter and soil chemistry. Our data provide evidence of considerable plasticity in soil fungal community composition over time spans as short as 6-11 years. This suggests that - at least within geographic zones characterised by more-or-less contiguous forest cover - soil fungal community composition depends most on availability of suitable habitat because dispersal propagules are readily available for colonisation after land use change.

These metabolites show strong potential to inhibit or kill insects and pathogenic fungi, especially those causing decline or damage of forest trees. In addition, FEFs can inhabit in leaf litter for a short or long period depending on endophytic species, thus they affect decomposition rate of leaf litter. Some FEFs can colonize in plant roots and promote plant growth.

Organic matter (OM) was buried for up to 6 months in plant containers in which mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal Pinus sylvestris L. seedlings were cultivated at a low rate of nutrient addition. After different periods of colonization the activities of phosphomonoesterase and protease, two enzymes involved in nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization, were determined in colonized and uncolonized litter. The activities of cellulase, $\beta$-xylosidase, $\beta$-glucosidase and polyphenol oxidase were investigated as indicators of the decomposition capacity of the fungi in the litter. Low activities of all enzymes tested were found in the uncolonized beech leaves. Phosphomonoesterase activity was high in litter colonized with L. nuda or S. bovinus, and was intermediate in the T. terrestris treatment. For all other enzymes the activities in the OM inoculated with the white-rot litter decomposer were considerably larger than those detected in litter colonized by ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes. Cellulase activity was low in the control as well as in the mycorrhizal treatments. $\beta$-Xylosidase and $\beta$-glucosidase were detected in the litter with mycorrhizal mycelium, whereas polyphenol oxidase activity was only clearly increased in the S. bovinus treatment. These results demonstrate the low lignocellulase activity of both mycorrhizal fungi. This feature reduces the capacity of the mycorrhizal fungi to exploit fresh beech leaf litter, whose endogenous nitrogen is associated with or shielded by refractory compounds. The results are discussed in relation to the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in nutrient cycling processes in temperate forest ecosystems.},

Few studies have coupled the effects of naturally occurring EM morphotypes to the nutrition of host trees. To investigate this, pine seedlings were grown on raw humus substrates collected at two forest sites, R2 and R3. Ectomycorrhiza morphotypes were identified, and their respective N uptake rates from organic (2- 13C, 15N-glycine) and inorganic ( 15NH 4Cl, Na 15NO 3, 15NH 4NO 3, NH4 15NO3) sources as well as their phosphate uptake rates were determined. Subsequently, the growth and nutritional status of the seedlings were analyzed. Two dominant EM morphotypes displayed significantly different mycorrhization rates in the two substrates. Rhizopogon luteolus Fr. (RL) was dominant in R2 and Suillus bovinus (Pers.) Kuntze (SB) was dominant in R3. 15N uptake of RL EM was at all times higher than that of SB EM. Phosphate uptake rates by the EM morphotypes did not differ significantly. The number of RL EM correlated negatively and the number of SB EM correlated positively with pine growth rate. Increased arginine concentrations and critical P/N ratios in needles indicated nutrient imbalances of pine seedlings from humus R2, predominantly mycorrhizal with RL. We conclude that different N supply in raw humus under Scots pine stands can induce shifts in the EM frequency of pine seedlings, and this may lead to EM formation by fungal strains with different ability to support tree growth. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author.},

However, our understanding has until recently been mainly based on laboratory experiments, and knowledge of such basic parameters as variations in mycelial production, standing biomass and turnover as well as the regulatory mechanisms behind such variations in forest soils is limited. Presently, the production of EMM by ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi has been estimated at $\sim$140 different forest sites to be up to several hundreds of kg per ha per year, but the published data are biased towards Picea abies in Scandinavia. Little is known about the standing biomass and turnover of EMM in other systems, and its influence on the C stored or lost from soils. Here, focussing on ectomycorrhizas, we discuss the factors that regulate the production and turnover of EMM and its role in soil C dynamics, identifying important gaps in this knowledge. C availability seems to be the key factor determining EMM production and possibly its standing biomass in forests but direct effects of mineral nutrient availability on the EMM can be important. There is great uncertainty about the rate of turnover of EMM. There is increasing evidence that residues of EM fungi play a major role in the formation of stable N and C in SOM, which highlights the need to include mycorrhizal effects in models of global soil C stores. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

The present study aimed to investigate the morphology, anatomy, and mycorrhizal status in roots of orchids of Sempu Island, Indonesia (Ascochilus emarginatus, Taeniophyllum biocellatum, and Thrixspermum subulatum), in relation to their adaptation to their habitat of coastal forests of Sempu Island. These orchids have different morphological characters; Ascochilus emarginatus and Thrixspermum subulatum are leafy orchids, while Taeniophyllum biocellatum is a leafless orchid. The results showed that all orchids have small number of velamen layers (1-2 layers) as an adaptation to the relatively humid condition. Cell wall thickenings of velamen, exodermis, and endodermis are structural adaptation of all orchids to the relatively high intensity of illumination, to reduce water loss because of transpiration. Mycorrhizal fungi colonization which is important for nutrient acquisition occurs in cortical cells. All orchids have differences in their cell shape, size, and specific characters, such as chloroplasts. The leafless Taeniophyllum biocellatum has many chloroplasts in the cortical root cells that support the photosynthesis process, while A. emarginatus and T. subulatum are lack of chloroplasts in their cortical root cells. {\textcopyright} 2016 Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

abstract = {Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition affects many natural processes, including forest litter decomposition. Saprotrophic fungi are the only organisms capable of completely decomposing lignocellulosic (woody) litter in temperate ecosystems, and therefore the responses of fungi to N deposition are critical in understanding the effects of global change on the forest carbon cycle. Plant litter decomposition under elevated N has been intensively studied, with varying results. The complexity of forest floor biota and variability in litter quality have obscured N-elevation effects on decomposers. Field experiments often utilize standardized substrates and N-levels, but few studies have controlled the decay organisms. Decomposition of beech (Fagus sylvatica) blocks inoculated with two cord-forming basidiomycete fungi, Hypholoma fasciculare and Phanerochaete velutina, was compared experimentally under realistic levels of simulated N deposition at Wytham Wood, Oxfordshire, UK. Mass loss was greater with P. velutina than with H. fasciculare, and with N treatment than in the control. Decomposition was accompanied by growth of the fungal mycelium and increasing N concentration in the remaining wood. We attribute the N effect on wood decay to the response of cord-forming wood decay fungi to N availability. Previous studies demonstrated the capacity of these fungi to scavenge and import N to decaying wood via a translocating network of mycelium. This study shows that small increases in N availability can increase wood decomposition by these organisms. Dead wood is an important carbon store and habitat. The responses of wood decomposers to anthropogenic N deposition should be considered in models of forest carbon dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Increasing soil nutrients through litter manipulation, pollution, or fertilization can adversely affect ectomycorrhizal (EM) communities by inhibiting fungal growth. In this study, we used molecular genetic methods to determine the effects of litter addition on the EM community of a Pinus contorta stand in Yellowstone National Park that regenerated after a stand-replacing fire. Two controls were used; in unmodified control plots nothing was added to the soil, and in perlite plots perlite, a chemically neutral substance, was added to maintain soil moisture and temperature at levels similar to those under litter. We found that (i) species richness did not change significantly following perlite addition (2.6 ± 0.3 species/core in control plots, compared with 2.3 ± 0.3 species/core in perlite plots) but decreased significantly (P < 0.05) following litter addition (1.8 ± 0.3 species/core); (ii) EM infection was not affected by the addition of perlite but increased significantly (P < 0.001) in response to litter addition, and the increase occurred only in the upper soil layer, directly adjacent to the added litter; and (iii) Suillus granulatus, Wilcoxina mikolae, and agaricoid DD were the dominant organisms in controls, but the levels of W. mikolae and agaricoid DD decreased significantly in response to both perlite and litter addition. The relative levels of S. granulatus and a fourth fungus, Cortinariaceae species 2, increased significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) following litter addition. Thus, litter addition resulted in some negative effects that may be attributable to moisture- temperature relationships rather than to the increased nutrients associated with litter. Some species respond positively to litter addition, indicating that there are differences in their physiologies. Hence, changes in the EM community induced by litter accumulation also may affect ecosystem function.},

abstract = {In boreal forest, ground vegetation of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) and feather mosses strongly suppress seed regeneration of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). We investigated a site preparation technique by steam treatment to control bilberry and moss vegetation after clear cutting. Sowing experiments were performed between 1993 and 1995 with Scots pine in four treatments: (1) untreated vegetation, (2) activated carbon added to the soil surface of otherwise intact ground vegetation, (3) steam treated vegetation, and (4) activated carbon added to the soil surface of steam treated vegetation. Activated carbon was added to adsorb possible phenolic compounds released from bilberry leaves and litter. Steam killed ground vegetation effectively and recolonisation of vascular plants and mosses was slow. Scots pine seedling establishment was improved by steam treatment especially when activated carbon was added to the soil surface. We interpret that activated carbon adsorbed and reduced the levels of phenolics from bilberry litter and humus, which otherwise may inhibit seed germination. Dry weight of four year old seedlings was three times higher in steam treated plots than in untreated plots. Seedling nutrient content was also strongly improved by steam treatment. We interpret the increased growth of seedlings in steam treated plots mainly as an effect of reduced resource competition from ground vegetation. Irrespective of treatment, almost all fine roots were colonised by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Using PCR-based molecular methods we were able to identify 28 taxa forming mycorrhiza on the seedlings. Steam treatment did not affect species richness and abundance of ectomycorrhizal inocculum. We conclude that steam treatment has the potential to be an efficient and environmentally acceptable method to reduce negative influence of bilberry vegetation on Scots pine seedling establishment and early growth.},

abstract = {Wildfire shapes the structure, dynamic and functioning of boreal forests. With predicted warmer and drier summers, increased incidence and intensity of crown-fires may affect plant–soil interactions with consequences for post-fire fertility and forest productivity. We assessed how severity of crown- and ground-fire in boreal pine forests affected post-fire responses of soil fungal communities and their associated enzyme activities, and how variation in fire severity interacts with salvage (post-fire) logging in impacting soil fungi. Crown fire-induced tree mortality had a stronger impact on fungal biomass and community composition than did ground-fire-induced loss of soil organic matter. Severe crown-fire led to replacement of ectomycorrhizal- and litter-associated fungi by stress-tolerant ascomycetes. Elevated activities of hydrolytic enzymes in burned areas were correlated with root-associated ascomycetes and moulds, suggesting opportunistic exploitation of labile organic substrates. Fire did not, however, increase the abundance of more potent basidiomycete decomposers in the organic layer, nor did it enhance organic matter oxidation by fungal peroxidases, indicating that the potential for major post-fire losses of carbon due to stimulated decomposition is limited. Rather, peroxidase activity was low in burned areas, likely reflecting the absence of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Post-fire salvage logging induced larger shifts in fungal communities in areas with low crown-fire severity. Synthesis. Historically, boreal pine forests have been shaped by low-severity ground-fires. Our study highlights a risk that increasing occurrence of high-severity crown-fire as climate warms will have detrimental effects on mycorrhizal-mediated functions that are pivotal for maintaining organic matter turnover, soil fertility and forest resilience. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal fungal tissues comprise a significant forest-litter pool. Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi may also influence the decomposition of other forest-litter components via competitive interactions with decomposer fungi and by ensheathing fine roots. Because of these direct and indirect effects of ectomycorrhizal fungi, the factors that control the decomposition of EM fungi will strongly control forest-litter decomposition as a whole and, thus, ecosystem nutrient and carbon cycling. Some have suggested that chitin, a component of fungal cell walls, reduces fungal tissue decomposition because it is relatively recalcitrant. We therefore examined the change in chitin concentrations of EM fungal tissues during decomposition. Our results show that chitin is not recalcitrant relative to other compounds in fungal tissues and that its concentration is positively related to the decomposition of fungal tissues. Variation existing among EM fungal isolates in chitin concentration suggests that EM fungal community structure influences C and nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Poa nemoralis L. (Wood Meadow-grass) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. The grass Poa nemoralis is widespread and frequent to locally common across the British Isles, except for western and central Ireland, and northern Scotland. In both its native Eurasian range and introduced ranges in, for example, the Americas, its main habitat comprises temperate (mixed) deciduous woodland. The species finds important secondary habitats in hedgerows, as well as in non-woodland vegetation such as on cliffs, screes and walls or sporadically in grassland and heathland. Although not always taxonomically or morphologically distinct units, the species is suspected to comprise many cytological races and hybrid polyploid populations with variable morphology. Morphological variation among P. nemoralis populations may also be a sign of local environmental adaptation or a result of introgressive hybridization with other, morphologically variable members of Poa section Stenopoa such as P. glauca, P. compressa or P. pratensis. Poa nemoralis is a small-statured, loosely caespitose grass, with populations ranging from a few individual tufts to those visually defining the aspect of the herbaceous understorey. The species tolerates moderate to deep shade on the forest floor, yet it tends to forage for available light, occurring more and growing taller in canopy gaps, forest edges and hedgerows. The amount of light is central to its survival and reproductive ecology, being important for flower induction, seed production and seed germination. The species produces large quantities of small, light seeds which facilitate spatial and temporal dispersal. The species occupies a wide range of soil pH (3–7) and nutrient conditions (C/N ratio ranges between 10 and 25), though it clearly prefers moderately acid and somewhat drier soils with limited litter thickness, avoiding soils with mor humus types. Poa nemoralis displays distinct small-scale acidifuge responses, being absent in areas of low soil pH (<3). Poa nemoralis is a moderately strong indicator of ancient woodland: it can quickly colonize recently established wooded areas adjacent to ancient woodland when it is not hindered by dispersal limitation and elevated nutrient levels. Nonetheless, dispersal limitation impedes rapid colonization of isolated, recently established woodlands, in spite of ample records of zoochorous seed dispersal. While currently frequent to locally common, the species is at risk if ancient woodlands continue to decline in its native Eurasian range. Across N.W. Europe, it is already in moderate decline in temperate deciduous ancient woodlands because of acidification, eutrophication and darkening of the forest understorey. In its introduced ranges, it is considered invasive. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors. Journal of Ecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological Society},

abstract = {Long-term fire exclusion may weaken ecosystem resistance to the return of fire. We investigated how a surface wildfire that occurred after several decades of fire exclusion affected a southern Appalachian forest transitioning from a fire-adapted to a fire-intolerant state. Tree traits associated with fire adaptation often co-occur with traits for nutrient conservation, including the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) association. In the absence of fire, the ECM association may facilitate the accumulation of organic matter, which becomes colonized by fine roots that then become vulnerable to consumption or damage by fire. Therefore, a deeper organic horizon might make stands of fire-adapted, ECM trees less resistant to a surface wildfire than stands of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM), fire-intolerant trees. To test this hypothesis, we established plots in stands that fall along a gradient of mycorrhizal tree relative abundance both inside and outside the perimeter of the 2016 Rock Mountain wildfire. With increasing relative abundance of ECM trees, we found increasing organic horizon depth and mass and slower rates of decay, even for litter of ECM tree species. We calculated a major (73–83%) reduction in fine root biomass and length in the organic horizon following the wildfire. Over three years post-fire, we observed a higher probability of crown decline, basal sprouting and aboveground biomass mortality with increasing abundance of ECM trees. We propose that the biogeochemistry of mycorrhizal associations can help explain why fire exclusion makes stands of fire-adapted trees less resistant to a surface wildfire than those with fire-intolerant trees. {\textcopyright} 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {High concentrations of metals in organic matter can inhibit decomposition and limit nutrient availability in ecosystems, but the long-term fate of metals bound to forest litter is poorly understood. Controlled experiments indicate that during the first few years of litter decay, Al, Fe, Pb, and other metals that form stable complexes with organic matter are naturally enriched by several hundred percent as carbon is oxidized. The transformation of fresh litter to humus takes decades, however, such that current datasets describing the accumulation and release of metals in decomposing organic matter are timescale limited. Here we use atmospheric 210Pb to quantify the fate of metals in canopy-derived litter during burial and decay in coniferous forests in New England and Norway where decomposition rates are slow and physical soil mixing is minimal. We measure 210Pb inventories in the O horizon and mineral soil and calculate a 60-630year timescale for the production of mobile organo-metallic colloids from the decomposition of fresh forest detritus. This production rate is slowest at our highest elevation ($\sim$1000m) and highest latitude sites (>63°N) where decomposition rates are expected to be low.We calculate soil layer ages by assuming a constant supply of atmospheric 210Pb and find that they are consistent with the distribution of geochemical tracers from weapons fallout, air pollution, and a direct 207Pb application at one site. By quantifying a gradient of organic matter ages with depth in the O horizon, we describe the accumulation and loss of metals in the soil profile as organic matter transforms from fresh litter to humus. While decomposition experiments predict that Al and Fe concentrations increase during the initial few years of decay, we show here that these metals continue to accumulate in humus for decades, and that enrichment occurs at a rate higher than can be explained by quantitative retention during decomposition alone. Acid extractable Al and Fe concentrations are higher in the humus layer of the O horizon than in the mineral soil immediately beneath this layer: it is therefore unlikely that physical soil mixing introduces significant Al and Fe to humus. This continuous enrichment of Al and Fe over time may best be explained by the recent suggestion that metals are mined from deeper horizons and brought into the O horizon via mycorrhizal plants. In sharp contrast to Al and Fe, we find that Mn concentrations in decomposing litter layers decrease exponentially with age, presumably because of leaching or rapid uptake, which may explain the low levels of acid extractable Mn in the mineral soil. This study quantifies how metals are enriched and lost in decomposing organic matter over a longer timescale than previous studies have been able to characterize. We also put new limits on the rate at which metals in litter become mobile organo-metallic complexes that can migrate to deeper soil horizons or surface waters. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Plants compete for nutrients using a range of strategies. We investigated nutrient foraging within nutrient hot-spots simultaneously available to plant species with diverse root traits. We hypothesized that there would be more root proliferation by thin-root species than by thick-root species, and that root proliferation by thin-root species would limit root proliferation by thick-root species. We conducted a root ingrowth experiment in a temperate forest in eastern USA where root systems of different tree species could interact. Tree species varied in the thickness of their absorptive roots, and were associated with either ectomycorrhizal (EM) or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Thus, there were thin- and thick-root AM and thin- and thick-root EM plant functional groups. Half the ingrowth cores were amended with organic nutrients (dried green leaves). Relative root length abundance, the proportion of total root length in a given soil volume occupied by a particular plant functional group, was calculated for the original root population and ingrowth roots after 6 months. The shift in relative root length abundance from original to ingrowth roots was positive in thin-root species but negative in thick-root species (p <.001), especially in unamended patches (AM: +6% vs. −7%; EM: +8% vs. −9%). Being thin-rooted may thus allow a species to more rapidly recolonize soil after a disturbance, which may influence competition for nutrients. Moreover, we observed that nutrient additions amplified the shift in root length abundance of thin over thick roots in AM trees (+13% vs. −14%), but not in EM trees (+1% vs −3%). In contrast, phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers suggested that EM fungal hyphae strongly proliferated in nutrient hot-spots whereas AM fungal hyphae exhibited only modest proliferation. We found no evidence that when growing in the shared patch, the proliferation of thin roots inhibited the growth of thick roots. Synthesis.

We analyzed the fruiting patterns of a rare but widely distributed saproxylic macromycete, Xylobolus subpileatus, during the ageing of natural canopy gaps in oak forests. In one of the last remaining Quercus ilex L. old-growth forests (on the island of Corsica, western Mediterranean basin), we systematically recorded and conducted molecular analyses of X. subpileatus basidiomes in 80 dated natural canopy gaps representing a 45-year long sequence of residence time of tree logs on the forest floor. Xylobolus subpileatus fruited exclusively on Q. ilex logs. The probability of fruiting of X. subpileatus significantly increases during the process of wood decomposition to reach its maximum in the oldest gaps, approximately 40 years after treefall. In contrast, the abundance and the richness of saprobic and ectomycorrhizal fruitbodies decrease as canopy gaps age. Our results emphasize the high ecological specialization of X. subpileatus. They also highlight the imperative need to conserve the last patches of old-growth Mediterranean forests to secure the persistence of this endangered and functionally unique macromycete whose presence is highly dependent on old wood in advanced stages of decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2017, Canadian Science Publishing.

Community structure of wood-inhabiting fungi changes with mass loss of wood, but the relationship between substrate quality and decomposers is poorly understood. This limits the extent to which these ecosystem services can be effectively managed. We studied the fungal community and physico-chemical quality (stage of decay, dimensions, density, moisture, C: N ratio, lignin and water or ethanol extractives) of 543 Norway spruce logs in five unmanaged boreal forest sites of southern Finland. Fungi were identified using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing of DNA extracted directly from wood samples. Macroscopic fruiting bodies were also recorded. Results showed a fungal community succession with decreasing wood density and C: N ratio, and increasing moisture and lignin content. Fungal diversity peaked in the most decayed substrates. Ascomycetes typically colonized recently fallen wood. Brown-rot fungi preferred the intermediate decay stages. White-rot fungi represented approximately one-fifth of sequenced species in all decay phases excluding the final phase, where ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi became dominant. Lignin content of logs with white-rot fungi was low, and ECM fungi were associated with substrates containing abundant nitrogen.

abstract = {Rhododendron maximum L., a spreading understory shrub, inhibits overstory regeneration and alters forest community structure in southern Appalachian hardwood forests. Using paired plots and reciprocal litter transplants in forests with and without R. maximum cover, we examined the influence of R. maximum on litter mass and quality, N cycling and soil extracellular enzymes. Standing stocks of soil organic matter, soil N, leaf litter mass and fine root biomass were greater in forests with R. maximum than those without. Tannin extracts from R. maximum foliage, and leaf litter and fine roots collected under R. maximum had a relatively high capacity to precipitate protein compared to extracts from trees. Across the growing season, soil inorganic N availability was generally lower under R. maximum, mostly due to reduced NO<inf>3</inf>- availability. Our data suggest that R. maximum litter alters N cycling through the formation of recalcitrant polyphenol-organic N complexes. Soil extracellular enzymes indicate the potential processing rates of organic substrates. Between forest types, polyphenol oxidase activity was greatest in R. maximum O horizons, regardless of litter type, suggesting that the local microbial community can better degrade and access protein-tannin-complexed N. Protease activity did not differ between forest types, but was greater on R. maximum leaf litter than hardwood leaf litter. The alteration of the N cycle via the formation of polyphenol-organic N complexes may contribute to hardwood seedling suppression, while the enzymatic release of these complexes by ericoid mycorrhizal fungi may increase N acquisition for R. maximum and contribute to its expansion in southern Appalachian forests. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {We investigated consequences of plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) in a tropical montane forest on Mt. Kinabalu in Borneo by measurements of light and soil conditions, ecophysiological analyses of tree seedlings, a long-term adult and seedling census, and a simple simulation model. The study plot (2.74 ha) is in a mixed conifer-broadleaf forest with 24% relative basal area of conifers. First, we investigated light and soil conditions beneath two dominant species, a conifer Dacrydium gracilis (Podocarpaceae, arbuscular mycorrhizal tree) and a broadleaf Lithocaprus clementianus (Fagaceae, ectomycorrhizal tree). The relative light intensity was marginally higher beneath Dacrydium tree crown than beneath Lithocarpus tree crown. The concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and labile phosphorus, and the nitrogen mineralization rate, were lower beneath Dacrydium than beneath Lithocarpus, suggesting that soils beneath Dacrydium were more nutrient deficient. Microscopic observations confirmed that conifer seedlings (including Dacrydium) harbored arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In addition, a molecular analysis showed that root-associated mycorrhizal fungal communities were clearly different between conifer and broadleaf seedlings, and consequently, nutrient acquisition capacity of seedlings may be different between them. Indeed, stable isotopic evidence suggested that Dacrydium seedlings are more efficient in inorganic nitrogen acquisition than Lithocarpus seedlings. These results predicted that the conifer seedlings would out-compete broadleaf seedlings and have a greater advantage beneath the conifer canopy. To test the possible advantage of conifer seedlings in performance, we developed hierarchical Bayesian models and estimated growth and mortality rates using the seedling census data during 2006-2012. We found that conifer seedlings performed better than broadleaf seedlings beneath Dacrydium canopy. On the other hand, broadleaf seedlings performed better than conifer seedlings beneath Lithocarpus canopy. The consequences of the PSFs for the tree community composition were investigated by developing a simple simulation model, and were compared with the results of a model without PSFs. After a 10 000-year simulation, the relative abundance of conifers with PSFs converged to 22%, which was consistent with the actual abundance; the model without effects of PSFs predicted a relative abundance of only $\sim$10%. The results suggested that PSFs contributed to the maintenance of the conifer dominance in the tropical montane forest. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Carbon (C) fluxes among different components of plant growth are important to forest ecosystem C cycling and are strongly influenced by species composition and resource availability. Although mycorrhizal fungi are crucial for nutrient acquisition and can receive a large fraction of annual net primary production, most studies do not explicitly include carbon flux to mycorrhizal fungi in ecosystem C budgets. We measured annual production of plant components (foliage, wood, fine roots) and mycorrhizal fungi across temperate forest stands varying in species composition. Production of mycorrhizal fungi was estimated using both mass balance and isotopic techniques. Total plant production varied from about 600 g C m−2 y−1 in nearly pure deciduous broadleaf stands down to about 300 g C m−2 y−1 in conifer-dominated stands. In contrast, the production of mycorrhizal fungi was highest in conifer-dominated stands, varying from less than 25 g C m−2 y−1 in deciduous broadleaf stands to more than 175 g C m−2 y−1 in nearly pure conifer stands. Isotopic data indicated that both tree species composition and ecosystem nitrogen (N) availability influenced rates of fungal production. The large investment in mycorrhizal fungi in low-N, conifer-dominated stands demonstrated that a full accounting of ecosystem carbon fluxes to plant and fungal components may help resolve current discrepancies observed in broadscale forest carbon budgets, especially across forest types. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {We investigated microbial biomass, fungal biomass and microbial community structure at three altitudes (1000, 2000 and 3000 m) and in two soil layers [L/F layer (Layer I) and underlying H/Ah layer (Layer II)] of tropical mountain rain forests in southern Ecuador. Basal respiration, microbial biomass and concentration of ergosterol generally declined from Layer I to Layer II and peaked at 2000 m. Compared to temperate forest ecosystems microbial biomass and ergosterol concentrations were generally low. Patterns in phospholipid fatty acids indicated that the composition of microbial communities markedly changed from Layer I to Layer II. These differences between layers decreased with increasing altitude. The concentration of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal marker PLFA 16:1$\omega$5c decreased with altitude in Layer I but increased in Layer II. The fungal-to-bacterial ratio increased with altitude and was higher in Layer I than in Layer II. Presumably, low microbial biomass in soils of tropical forest ecosystems is due to high temperature associated with high respiration but also low litter quality, with the latter declining with altitude. These conclusions are supported by the fact that at higher altitude the microbial community changed from a bacterial-dominated to a fungal-dominated system. CCA showed that microbial biomass correlated closely with density of a number of putatively bacterial feeding testate amoeba species including Corythion dubium Taranek, 1871, Euglypha cristata Leidy, 1879, Trigonopyxis arcula Penard, 1912, Tracheleuglypha dentata Deflandre, 1928 and Trinema lineare Penard, 1890. Ergosterol concentrations, but not the PLFA 18:2$\omega$6c, strongly correlated with the putatively fungal feeding species Phryganella acropodia (Hertwig, Lesser, 1874) Hopkinson, 1909. Generally, parallel to microbial biomass and ergosterol concentrations the density of testate amoebae peaked at 2000 m. However, compared to microbial parameters changes in testate amoebae communities between two layers were less pronounced. The data suggest that density and community structure of testate amoebae are driven by the availability of food resources (bacteria and fungi) which at high altitude decrease with increasing moisture and decreasing pH. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Soil microbes in temperate forest ecosystems are able to cycle several hundreds of kilograms of N per hectare per year and are therefore of paramount importance for N retention. Belowground C allocation by trees is an important driver of seasonal microbial dynamics and may thus directly affect N transformation processes over the course of the year. Our study aimed at unraveling plant controls on soil N cycling in a temperate beech forest at a high temporal resolution over a time period of two years, by investigating the effects of tree girdling on microbial N turnover. In both years of the experiment, we discovered (1) a summer N mineralization phase (between July and August) and (2) a winter N immobilization phase (November-February). The summer mineralization phase was characterized by a high N mineralization activity, low microbial N uptake, and a subsequent high N availability in the soil. During the autumn/winter N immobilization phase, gross N mineralization rates were low, and microbial N uptake exceeded microbial N mineralization, which led to high levels of N in the microbial biomass and low N availability in the soil. The observed immobilization phase during the winter may play a crucial role for ecosystem functioning, since it could protect dissolved N that is produced by autumn litter degradation from being lost from the ecosystem during the phase when plants are mostly inactive. The difference between microbial biomass N levels in winter and spring equals 38 kg N/ha and may thus account for almost one- third of the annual plant N demand. Tree girdling strongly affected annual N cycling: the winter N immobilization phase disappeared in girdled plots (microbial N uptake and microbial biomass N were significantly reduced, while the amount of available N in the soil solution was enhanced). This was correlated to a reduced fungal abundance in autumn in girdled plots. By releasing recently fixed photosynthates to the soil, plants may thus actively control the annual microbial N cycle. Tree belowground C allocation increases N accumulation in microorganisms during the winter which may ultimately feed back on plant N availability in the following growing season. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {With the rapid industrial development and modern agricultural practices, increasing nitrogen (N) deposition can cause nutrient imbalance in immature volcanic ash soil commonly found in Japan. Larch species, widely distributed in northeast Eurasia, are associated with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi which play a critical role in nutrient acquisition for their hosts. In this study, we investigated species richness and diversity of ECM fungi associated with a hybrid larch (F1) and its parents, Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii var. japonica) and Japanese larch (L. kaempferi), under simulated N deposition (0 and 100 kg ha− 1 yr− 1) with/without phosphorous (P) (0 and 50 kg ha− 1 yr− 1). Seedlings planted in immature volcanic ash with low nutrient availability were subjected to the N and P treatments for fifteen months. We found that response of ECM community structure to the increased nutrient availability depended on host genotypes. Nutrient addition significantly affected ECM structure in Japanese larch, but no such significant effect was found for Dahurian larch. Effects of the nutrient addition to ECM fungal community in F1 were intermediate. F1 was tolerant to high N loading, which was due to consistent, relatively high association with Suillus sp. and Hebeloma sp. F1 showed heterosis in relative biomass, which was most apparent under high N treatments. This co-variation of ECM fungal community structure and F1 biomass in response to N loading suggest that ECM community structure might play an important role in host growth. The present findings indicate effects of N deposition on ECM fungal community structure can depend on larch species, thus it is challenging to predict general trends. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Many northern forests are limited by nitrogen (N) availability, slight changes in which can have profound effects on ecosystem function and the activity of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi. Increasing N and phosphorus (P) availability, an analog to accelerated soil organic matter decomposition in a warming climate, could decrease plant dependency on EcM fungi and increase plant productivity as a result of greater carbon use efficiency. However, the impact of altered N and P availability on the growth and activity of EcM fungi in boreal forests remains poorly understood despite recognition of their importance to host plant nutrition and soil carbon sequestration. To address such uncertainty we examined above and belowground ecosystem properties in a boreal black spruce forest following five years of factorial N and P additions. By combining detailed soil, fungal, and plant $\delta$15N measurements with in situ metrics of fungal biomass, growth, and activity, we found both expected and unexpected patterns. Soil nitrate isotope values became 15N enriched in response to both N and P additions; fungal biomass was repressed by N yet both biomass and growth were stimulated by P; and, black spruce dependency on EcM derived N increased slightly when N and P were added alone yet significantly declined when added in combination. These findings contradict predictions that N fertilization would increase plant P demands and P fertilization would further exacerbate plant N demands. As a result, the prediction that EcM fungi predictably respond to plant N limitation was not supported. These findings highlight P as an under appreciated mediator of the activity of denitrifying bacteria, EcM fungi, and the dynamics of N cycles in boreal forests. Further, use of $\delta$15N values from bulk soils, plants, and fungi to understand how EcM systems respond to changing nutrient availabilities will often require additional ecological information. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Species numbers in unburnt Pinus mugo and Pinus sylvestris stands showed annual fluctuation, but in the burnt sites, the numbers of fungi increased yearly, especially in the crown fire plots. Both burnt stand types-P. mugo and P. sylvestris-showed strongly significant (two-way ANOSIM; R = 1, p < 0.05) differences in species composition; the differences between unburnt sites were clearly expressed but less significant (R = 0.86, p < 0.05). Fungal species composition of burnt P. mugo and P. sylvestris sites was qualitatively different from that of corresponding unburnt sites (two-way ANOSIM; R ≥ 0.75, p < 0.05). The chronosequence of mycobiota in surface fire burns was less clearly defined than in crown fire sites, reflecting the greater patchiness of impacts of the surface fire. Although both fire types were detrimental or at least damaging to all functional groups of fungi (saprobic on soil and forest litter, wood-inhabiting, biotrophic, and mycorrhizal and lichenized fungi), their recovery and appearance (fructification) patterns varied between the groups and among the burn types. The end of the early post-fire fungal succession (cessation of sporocarp production of pyrophilous fungi) was recorded 3 years after the fire for both crown and surface fire types, which is earlier than reported by other authors.

abstract = {Declining biodiversity (BD) is affecting food security, agricultural sustainability, and environmental quality. Agroforestry (AF) is recognized as a possible partial solution for BD conservation and improvement. This manuscript uses published peer-reviewed manuscripts, reviews, meta-analysis, and federal and state agency documents to evaluate relationships between AF and BD and how AF can be used to conserve BD. The review revealed that floral, faunal, and soil microbial diversity were significantly greater in AF as compared to monocropping, adjacent crop lands, and within crop alleys and some forests. Among the soil organisms, arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi (AMF), bacteria, and enzyme activities were significantly greater in AF than crop and livestock practices. Agroforestry also creates spatially concentrated high-density BD near trees due to favorable soil-plant-water-microclimate conditions. The greater BD was attributed to heterogeneous vegetation, organic carbon, microclimate, soil conditions, and spatial distribution of trees. Differences in BD between AF and other management types diminished with time. Evenly distributed leaves, litter, roots, dead/live biological material, and microclimate improve soil and microclimate in adjacent crop and pasture areas as the system matures. Results of the study prove that integration of AF can improve BD in agricultural lands. Selection of site suitable tree/shrub/grass-crop combinations can be used to help address soil nutrient deficiencies or environmental conditions. Future studies with standardized management protocols may be needed for all regions to further strengthen these findings and to develop AF establishment criteria for BD conservation and agricultural sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

This observation has been confirmed by experimentation where leaf litter patches accumulated under artificial stems for a period of 2 years. Leaf litter patches of different sizes contain differing proportions of leaf species. Large patches contain a significantly higher proportion of oak leaves than small patches. Difference in physical structure of large and small patches, due to leaf species composition and due to differential leaf chemistries, result in differences in soil characteristics and soil biota under the patches. Soil moisture and organic matter content of upper soil layers are greater under large litter patches than under small ones.

abstract = {Establishing diverse mycorrhizal fungal communities is considered important for forest recovery, yet mycorrhizae may have complex effects on tree growth depending on the composition of fungal species present. In an effort to understand the role of mycorrhizal fungi community in forest restoration in southern Costa Rica, we sampled the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community across eight sites that were planted with the same species (Inga edulis, Erythrina poeppigiana, Terminalia amazonia, and Vochysia guatemalensis) but varied twofold to fourfold in overall tree growth rates. The AMF community was measured in multiple ways: as percent colonization of host tree roots, by DNA isolation of the fungal species associated with the roots, and through spore density, volume, and identity in both the wet and dry seasons. Consistent with prior tropical restoration research, the majority of fungal species belonged to the genus Glomus and genus Acaulospora, accounting for more than half of the species and relative abundance found on trees roots and over 95% of spore density across all sites. Greater AMF diversity correlated with lower soil organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen concentrations and longer durations of prior pasture use across sites. Contrary to previous literature findings, AMF species diversity and spore densities were inversely related to tree growth, which may have arisen from trees facultatively increasing their associations with AMF in lower soil fertility sites. Changes to AMF community composition also may have led to variation in disturbance susceptibility, host tree nutrient acquisition, and tree growth. These results highlight the potential importance of fungal–tree–soil interactions in forest recovery and suggest that fungal community dynamics could have important implications for tree growth in disturbed soils. {\"{i}}¿½ 2016 The Authors.

abstract = {The spatio-temporal distribution of basidiomycetes colonising coniferous litter, and their impact on carbon and nitrogen cycling is reviewed. Afteria brief phase of colonisation by phyllosphere ascomycetes and ephemeral basidiomycetes, litter is colonised by fungi with higher capacity for litter decomposition, such as Mycena species. This change in fungal community composition involves a shift in substrate utilisation from relatively readly available sugars to cellulose. The fungi overcome the nitrogen deficiency experienced during litter colonisation by translocating nitrogen from older parts of the mycelium. To retrieve nitrogen from well-decomposed litter, the fungi presumably use carbohydrates translocated from fresh litter as a co-substrate to attack polyphenol-nitrogen complexes. After a few years of decomposition, the saprotrophic fungal community is out-competed by mycorrhizal fungi. Their direct access to photo-assimilates is likely to be a major competitive advantage in highly recalcitrant and cellulose-depleted resources. Decomposition is continued by the mycorrhizal fungi, although at a very slow rate. It is not until this phase that net losses of nitrogen from the litter occur, as the mycorrhizal fungi forage for nitrogen to support themselves and their host plants. In low-productivity coniferous forests, saprotrophic fungi, thus, re-cycle litter carbon to the atmosphere, whereas re-cycling of litter nitrogen to growing plants is performed largely by my-corrhizal fungi. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background. Soil microbial communities and their associated enzyme
activities play key roles in carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems.
Soil microbial communities are sensitive to resource availability, but
the mechanisms of microbial regulation have not been thoroughly
investigated. Here, we tested the mechanistic relationships between
microbial responses and multiple interacting resources.
Methods. We examined soil carbon properties, soil microbial community
structure and carbon-related functions under nitrogen addition and plant
inputs removal (litter removal (NL), root trench and litter removal
(NRL)) in a pure Larix principis-rupprechtii plantation in northern
China.
Results. We found that nitrogen addition affected the soil microbial
community structure, and that microbial biomass increased significantly
once 100 kg ha a of nitrogen was added. The interactions between
nitrogen addition and plant inputs removal significantly affected soil
bacteria and their enzymatic activities (oxidases). The NL treatment
enhanced soil microbial biomass under nitrogen addition. We also found
that the biomass of gram-negative bacteria and saprotrophic fungi
directly affected the soil microbial functions related to carbon
turnover. The biomass of gram-negative bacteria and peroxidase activity
were key factors controlling soil carbon dynamics. The interactions
between nitrogen addition and plant inputs removal strengthened the
correlation between the hydrolases and soil carbon.
Conclusions. This study showed that nitrogen addition and plant inputs
removal could alter soil enzyme activities and further affect soil
carbon turnover via microbial regulation. The increase in soil microbial
biomass and the microbial regulation of soil carbon both need to be
considered when developing effective sustainable forest management
practices for northern China. Moreover, further studies are also needed
to exactly understand how the complex interaction between the plant and
below-ground processes affects the soil microbial community structure.},

Soil beneath mature sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) trees was treated with (NH4)2SO4 granules at application rates of 0, 250, 500, and 1000 kg/ha in May of each year between 1993 and 1994 at Dorset and between 1993 and 1995 at Loring. The fertilizer treatments did not cause visual symptoms of forest decline. At Dorset, SO4 and cation concentrations in soil leachate increased, but no difference in soil pH between treatments was found. An increase in foliar N was recorded at Dorset in treated plots, although there were no other differences in foliar or tree ring chemistry between treatments. At Loring, a decrease in soil pH and an increase in SO4 in soil leachate were found in treated plots. Mycorrhizal infection and litter decomposition were also reduced in plots treated with (NH4)2SO4. Fertilizer application at Loring led to increases in foliar concentrations of N, Mg, Mn, and Cd, along with increases in concentrations of trace metals (As, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Zn) in tree rings formed during fertilizer application. Significant positive correlations (p < 0.05) were found between wood (rings formed between 1993 and 1995) and foliage (mean of 1993-1995 values) for Mg, Mn, and Al. Deliberate acidification of surface soil resulted in changes in wood and foliar chemistry, although it remains to be established whether acidification of surface soil is responsible for the reported decline in sugar maple.},

The protective role of the mycorrhizal fungus with respect to pathogen attack could be validated against Botrytis cinerea and Heterobasidion annosum in co-cultures revealing reduced pathogen growth, higher survival rate of the spruce trees and reduced symptoms on needles upon symbiosis with T. vaccinum. The community structure was shown to yield a high diversity in ECM forming basidiomycetes of Thelephorales and Agaricales associated with a rich bacterial diversity dominated by Rhizobiales with the most abundant Nitrobacter winogradski (3.9%). Isolated bacteria were then used to address plant growth promoting abilities, which included production of the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (performed by 74% of the bacterial isolates), siderophores (22%), and phosphate mobilization (23%). Among the isolates, mycorrhiza helper bacteria (MHB) were identified, with Bacillus cereus MRZ-1 inducing hyperbranching in T. vaccinum, supporting tree germination, shoot elongation, and root formation as well as higher mycorrhization rates. Thus, a huge pool of potential MHB and fungal community with widely distributed auxin-production potential extended the ability of T. vaccinum to form ectomycorrhiza. The forest community profited from the mycorrhizal fungus T. vaccinum, with spruce survival enhanced by 33% in microcosms using soil from the native habitat. A higher fungal abundance and diversity in cases where the tree had died during the experiment, showing that decomposition of plant litter from a dead tree supported a different community. T. vaccinum thus actively structured the community of microorganisms in its habitat. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2019 Wagner, Krause, Gallegos-Monterrosa, Sammer, Kov{\'{a}}cs and Kothe.},

In subarctic birch forests (Betula pubescens), ecosystem C cycling is largely affected by recurrent outbreaks of defoliating geometrid moths (Epirrita autumnata, Operophtera brumata). Here, we show that soil C stocks in birch forests across Fennoscandia did not change up to 8 years after moth outbreaks. We found that a decrease in woody fine roots was accompanied by a lower soil CO2 efflux rate and a higher soil N availability following moth outbreaks. We suggest that a high N availability and less ectomycorrhiza likely contributed to lowered heterotrophic respiration and soil enzymatic activity. Based on proxies for decomposition (heterotrophic respiration, phenol oxidase potential activity), we conclude that a decrease in decomposition is a prime cause why soil C stocks of mountain birch forest ecosystems have not changed after moth outbreaks. Compared to disturbed temperate and boreal forests, a CO2-related positive feedback of forest disturbance on climate change might therefore be smaller in subarctic regions. {\textcopyright} 2019, The Author(s).},

important nutrient cycling pathway in these ecosystems. We tested two
hypotheses using seedlings of dipterocarp species: (1) addition of leaf
litter improves growth; (2) and litter addition affects both
ectomycorrhizal (ECM) colonization and community structure.
Three dipterocarp species with contrasting ecologies (Parashorea
tomentella, Hopea nervosa and Dryobalanops lanceolata) were grown in a
nursery in forest soil with or without the addition of litter.
Litter addition improved the growth of all three species. There was no
effect of litter addition on total percentage ECM colonization but ECM
diversity and percentage colonization by Cenococcum geophilum were lower
with litter addition. Foliar delta(15)N was lower in two of the three
species grown in the presence of litter, reflecting the lower delta(15)N
of the litter compared with the soil. There was a negative correlation
between delta(15)N and percentage ECM, suggesting a role for ECMs in
accessing litter-derived N sources.
This study shows that litter addition improved the growth of dipterocarp
seedlings and that the ECM associations of dipterocarps facilitated
access to this organic nutrient source. This has implications for the
successful regeneration of seedlings in the rain forest understorey.},

However, the effect of grazing on soil fungal communities, which are intimately linked to plants, is not currently known. Therefore, our objectives were to investigate changes caused by reindeer grazing on soil fungal communities, litter decomposition rate and litter degrading extracellular enzyme activities. The study was conducted in four areas divided into grazed and non-grazed sites (all together 38 sample plots) in northern boreal forests in Finnish Lapland. Fungal communities were analyzed from humus with high-throughput sequencing technology (454-pyrosequencing), and litter mass loss and extracellular enzyme activities were analyzed after a one-year litterbag experiment. The results showed that grazing significantly affected the fungal community structure and the abundance of certain fungal genera and species. Grazing also decreased laccase and enhanced cellobiohydrolase I activities from the litterbags. Our study is one of the first to describe detailed fungal community composition in sites with long-term history of reindeer grazing and exclusion. Our results indicate that reindeer grazing alter fungal community structure and litter degradation related enzyme activities in the northern boreal forest soils. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors},

We tested three hypotheses by which ectomycorrhizas might facilitate the dominance of the tree, Oreomunnea mexicana, in montane tropical forest in Panama. We tested whether access to ectomycorrhizal networks improved growth and survival of seedlings, evaluated whether ectomycorrhizal fungi promote seedling growth via positive plant-soil feedback, and measured whether Oreomunnea reduced inorganic nitrogen availability. We found no evidence that Oreomunnea benefits from ectomycorrhizal networks or plant-soil feedback. However, we found three-fold higher soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations outside than inside Oreomunnea-dominated forest and a correlation between soil nitrate and Oreomunnea abundance in plots. Ectomycorrhizal effects on nitrogen cycling might therefore provide an explanation for the monodominance of ectomycorrhizal tree species worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {The fungi-to-bacteria ratio in soil ecological concepts and its application to explain the effects of land use changes have gained increasing attention over the past decade. Four different main approaches for quantifying the fungal and bacterial contribution to microbial tissue can be distinguished: (1) microscopic methods, (2) selective inhibition, (3) specific cell membrane components and (4) specific cell wall components. In this review, the different methods were compared and we hypothesized that all these approaches result in similar values for the fungal and bacterial contribution to total microbial biomass, activity, and residues (dead microbial tissue) if these methods are evenly reliable for the estimation of fungal biomass. The fungal contribution to the microbial biomass or respiration varied widely between 2 and 95% in different data sets published over the past three decades. However, the majority of the literature data indicated that fungi dominated microbial biomass, respiration or non-biomass microbial residues, with mean percentages obtained by the different methodological approaches varying between 35 and 76% in different soil groups, i.e. arable, grassland, and forest soils and litter layers. Microscopic methods generally gave the lowest average values, especially in arable and grasslands soils. Very low ratios in fungal biomass C-to-ergosterol obtained by microscopic methods suggest a severe underestimation of fungal biomass by certain stains. Relatively consistent ratios of ergosterol to linoleic acid (18:2$\omega$6,9) indicate that both cell membrane components are useful indicators for saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi. More quantitative information on the PLFA content of soil bacteria and the 16:1$\omega$5 content of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is urgently required to fully exploit the great potential of PLFA measurements. The most consistent results have been obtained from the analysis of fungal glucosamine and bacterial muramic acid in microbial residues. Component-specific $\delta$13C analyses of PLFA and amino sugars are a promising prospect for the near future. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Rates of asymbiotic nitrogen fixation in woody debris, forest floor and mineral soils were investigated in stem-only harvested and wildfire-killed lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Wats.) stands in the central interior of British Columbia using an acetylene reduction assay. The long-term contribution of those nitrogen fixation processes to site nitrogen economy was estimated by mass loadings, associated nitrogen fixation rates and decomposition models. Asymbiotic nitrogen fixation activity was detected in all the woody and litter substrates examined. There were significant differences in nitrogenase activities between substrates. The highest activity (16.10±4.75 nm C2H4 g-1day-1) occurred in the below-ground woody debris (dead roots), followed in order by stumps, advanced or medium decay stems, litter, humus, early decay stems and, the lowest (0.07±0.03 nm C2H4 g-1day-1), mineral soil. Because of its relatively high rate of nitrogen fixation, below-ground woody debris is thought to have an important, but largely unrecognized, ecological role in the long-term site productivity of lodgepole pine forests. Moisture was the most important factor affecting the asymbiotic nitrogen fixation activity in woody debris in the study area. Asymbiotic nitrogen fixation in the above-ground woody debris was greater on the wildfire-killed sites than on the harvested sites due to much higher woody debris loadings and longer persistence on the former sites. The dynamics and role of asymbiotic nitrogen fixation over pine stand development were presented and discussed. Replacement of nitrogen removals from disturbance by asymbiotic nitrogen fixation would take 180 years for both stem-only and wildfire-killed sites. However, this could be shortened while considering other sources of nitrogen fixation in the study area such as nitrogen-fixing shrub, Sheperdia canadensis (L) Nutt and mycorrhizae. Management implications of asymbiotic nitrogen fixation were also discussed.},

abstract = {Litter decomposition is an enzymatically-complex process that is mediated by a diverse assemblage of saprophytic microorganisms. It is a globally important biogeochemical process that can be suppressed by anthropogenic N deposition. In a northern hardwood forest ecosystem located in Michigan, USA, 20 years of experimentally increased atmospheric N deposition has reduced forest floor decay and increased soil C storage. Here, we paired extracellular enzyme assays with shotgun metagenomics to assess if anthropogenic N deposition has altered the functional potential of microbial communities inhabiting decaying forest floor. Experimental N deposition significantly reduced the activity of extracellular enzymes mediating plant cell wall decay, which occurred concurrently with changes in the relative abundance of metagenomic functional gene pathways mediating the metabolism of carbohydrates, aromatic compounds, as well as microbial respiration. Moreover, experimental N deposition increased the relative abundance of 50 of the 60 gene pathways, the majority of which were associated with saprotrophic bacteria. Conversely, the relative abundance and composition of fungal genes mediating the metabolism of plant litter was not affected by experimental N deposition. Future rates of atmospheric N deposition have favored saprotrophic soil bacteria, whereas the metabolic potential of saprotrophic fungi appears resilient to this agent of environmental change. Results presented here provide evidence that changes in the functional capacity of saprotrophic soil microorganisms mediate how anthropogenic N deposition increases C storage in soil. {\textcopyright} 2016 Freedman, Upchurch, Zak and Cline.},

abstract = {New knowledge on soil structure highlights its importance for hydrology and soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization, which however remains neglected in many wide used models. We present here a new model, KEYLINK, in which soil structure is integrated with the existing concepts on SOM pools, and elements from food web models, that is, those from direct trophic interactions among soil organisms. KEYLINK is, therefore, an attempt to integrate soil functional diversity and food webs in predictions of soil carbon (C) and soil water balances. We present a selection of equations that can be used for most models as well as basic parameter intervals, for example, key pools, functional groups' biomasses and growth rates. Parameter distributions can be determined with Bayesian calibration, and here an example is presented for food web growth rate parameters for a pine forest in Belgium. We show how these added equations can improve the functioning of the model in describing known phenomena. For this, five test cases are given as simulation examples: changing the input litter quality (recalcitrance and carbon to nitrogen ratio), excluding predators, increasing pH and changing initial soil porosity. These results overall show how KEYLINK is able to simulate the known effects of these parameters and can simulate the linked effects of biopore formation, hydrology and aggregation on soil functioning. Furthermore, the results show an important trophic cascade effect of predation on the complete C cycle with repercussions on the soil structure as ecosystem engineers are predated, and on SOM turnover when predation on fungivore and bacterivore populations are reduced. In summary, KEYLINK shows how soil functional diversity and trophic organization and their role in C and water cycling in soils should be considered in order to improve our predictions on C sequestration and C emissions from soils. {\textcopyright} 2021 PeerJ Inc..

abstract = {The linkage between tree diversity and the soil food web in temperate deciduous forest ecosystems remains uncertain. Using microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), we analyzed the effect of tree species composition on microbial communities from topsoil collected in Hainich National Park, Germany. Previous results had shown minimal direct effects of tree species on the microbial community in autumn, most likely due to low plant activity and high nutrient and energy input from litterfall. However, microbial composition was affected indirectly through an influence of tree species on soil pH. In this study, we analyzed PLFA profiles in early summer and compared them with the results from autumn sampling. We hypothesized that plant-based traits would have stronger direct effects on the abundance and structure of the microbial community during the photosynthetically active period. The results showed that the soil microbial community differed more markedly between the tree diversity levels in early summer than in autumn. The acidifying character of the decaying beech litter strongly influenced the soil pH values and structured the soil microbial community indirectly in early summer as it had in autumn. However, the measured differences in the microbial composition in early summer could be attributed primarily to litter quality. This direct influence of plant traits appeared to be eclipsed in autumn because of the high nutrient supply from fresh litter input. Following litter decomposition in the topsoil, however, litter-based plant traits emerged as a factor structuring the soil microbial community in early summer. Our results suggest that the PLFAs i14:0 and i15:0, indicative of Gram-positive bacteria, are strongly involved in decomposition processes and may be promoted by readily available nutrients. Furthermore, our results indicate that a dense root network in association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi strongly supported microbial growth in the more diverse forest stands. High proportions of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (PLFA 16:1$\omega$5), root-associated microorganisms (PLFAs 16:1$\omega$9, 16:1$\omega$7, 17:1$\omega$8 and 18:1$\omega$7) and bacterial grazers (PLFA 20:5) characterized the microbial community in early summer on these study plots. We conclude that microbial communities are strongly influenced by abiotic controls. However, seasonal differences in litter decomposition rates and root activity should be considered in the analysis of the effects of tree diversity or species on soil microbial communities {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Buttressing is a trait special to tropical trees but explanations for its occurrence remain inconclusive. The two main hypotheses are that they provide structural support and/or promote nutrient acquisition. Studies of the first are common but the second has received much less attention. Architectural measurements were made on adult and juvenile trees of the ectomycorrhizal species Microberlinia bisulcata, in Korup (Cameroon). Buttressing on this species is highly distinctive with strong lateral extension of surface roots of the juveniles leading to a mature buttress system of a shallow spreading form on adults. This contrasts with more vertical buttresses, closer to the stem, found on many other tropical tree species. No clear relationship between main buttress and large branch distribution was found. Whilst this does not argue against the essential structural role of buttresses for these very large tropical trees, the form on M. bisulcata does suggest a likely second role, that of aiding nutrient acquisition. At the Korup site, with its deep sandy soils of very low phosphorus status, and where most nutrient cycling takes place in a thin surface layer of fine roots and mycorrhizas, it appears that buttress form could develop from soil-surface root exploration for nutrients by juvenile trees. It may accordingly allow M. bisulcata to attain the higher greater competitive ability, faster growth rate, and maximum tree size that it does compared with other co-occurring tree species. For sites across the tropics in general, the degree of shallowness and spatial extension of buttresses of the dominant species is hypothesized to increase with decreasing nutrient availability. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Stable isotope ratios of terrestrial ecosystem nitrogen (N) pools reflect internal processes and input-output balances. Disturbance generally increases N cycling and loss, yet few studies have examined ecosystem $\delta$15N over a disturbance-recovery sequence. We used a chronosequence approach to examine N distribution and $\delta$15N during forest regrowth after agricultural abandonment. Site ages ranged from 10 to 115 years, with similar soils, climate, land-use history, and overstory vegetation (white pine Pinus strobus). Foliar N and $\delta$15N decreased as stands aged, consistent with a progressive tightening of the N cycle during forest regrowth on agricultural lands. Over time, foliar $\delta$15N became more negative, indicating increased fractionation along the mineralization- mycorrhizal-plant uptake pathway. Total ecosystem N was constant across the chronosequence, but substantial internal N redistribution occurred from the mineral soil to plants and litter over 115 years (>25% of ecosystem N or 1,610 kg ha-1). Temporal trends in soil $\delta$15N generally reflected a redistribution of depleted N from the mineral soil to the developing O horizon. Although plants and soil $\delta$15N are coupled over millennial time scales of ecosystem development, our observed divergence between plants and soil suggests that they can be uncoupled during the disturbance-regrowth sequence. The approximate 2‰ decrease in ecosystem $\delta$15N over the century scale suggests significant incorporation of atmospheric N, which was not detected by traditional ecosystem N accounting. Consideration of temporal trends and disturbance legacies can improve our understanding of the influence of broader factors such as climate or N deposition on ecosystem N balances and $\delta$15N. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This characterization is based on the high N content of the needles, the high nitrate-N (NO3-N) mobilization and low cation mobilization from the organic horizon. The N cycle in this forest has been transformed into an 'open flow' system, in which the ammonium-N, deposited in large quantities from the atmosphere, is transformed into NO3-N, which is leached into the groundwater. Decomposition of deeper organic layers, such as the fragmented litter and humus layers, is thought to provide additional NH4-N, which explains the high NO3-N output. Together with a reduction in the number and vitality of the pine trees, there is an increase in the number of nitrophilous plants, such as Deschampsia flexuosa and Rumex acetosella.

abstract = {Seedlings of Eucalyptus regnans (mountain ash) grow poorly in undried forest soil, where they develop purple coloration in the foliage, but their growth is markedly improved when forest soil has been air dried. Whether this growth promotion is purely due to improved nutrient status of the soil, as a result of air drying, was investigated. In several pot experiments, E. regnans seedlings were grown (i) in air-dried and undried forest soil with addition of different levels of complete fertiliser, (ii) in air-dried or undried soil diluted to different extents with sand, or (iii) in undried soil mixed with different amounts of air-dried soil. Seedling dry weight, P content and incidence of ectomycorrhizal root tips were determined. In all experiments, the dry weights of seedlings were 3-6 times greater in 100% air-dried soil than in 100% undried soil. Fertiliser application resulted in a significant increase in dry weight of seedlings in both air-dried and undried soil, but the dry weights in air-dried soil were always significantly greater than those in undried soil at the same level of fertiliser application. Even at the highest level of fertiliser application, the growth difference between seedlings in air-dried and undried soil remained. When air-dried soil was diluted with sand, there was a significant reduction in seedling dry weight only when soil was diluted to 20% or less (air-dried soil:total mix). Conversly, when air-dried soil was mixed with undried soil, there was a proportional decrease in seedling dry weight with increasing amounts of undried soil. In all experiments, the dominant ectomycorrhizal morphotypes in 100% air-dried soil were different from those in undried soil. Fertilisation and dilution of air-dried and undried soil did not result in a reduction in the overall incidence of ectomycorrhizal root tips, although the frequency of occurrence of different ectomycorrhizal morphotypes was affected. It is concluded that the growth difference between seedlings in air-dried and undried forest soils is not due solely to differences in the direct availability of nutrients in the soils, and different ectomycorrhizae may indirectly affect nutrient availability to the plant. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {Fine roots are a dominant, but often overlooked source of carbon (C) in forest soils, and decomposition of this material may have important consequences for C storage and turnover in forest ecosystems. Forest harvesting modifies soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities, which may lead to faster decomposition rates, but the effect of harvesting on fine-root decomposition is rarely investigated. Variable-retention harvesting, where some trees are left on site after harvest, often results in lower soil moisture and temperature, and increased ectomycorrhizal diversity relative to clearcut harvesting. As such, this harvesting practice may influence fine-root decomposition rates. In Douglas-fir forests in coastal British Columbia, we measured fine-root (<2 mm diameter) decomposition rates in variable-retention (aggregate and dispersed arrangements), clearcut, and uncut treatments, and determined if any effects persisted as stands aged. Within the variable-retention treatments, we also examined if fine-root decomposition rates varied with distance from retention trees or retention patches. Further, we determined which soil physicochemical variables best explained variation in fine-root carbon loss after two years of decomposition. Increased tree coverage slowed fine-root decomposition; fine roots decomposed as slowly under variable-retention treatments as in uncut stands, and 15–19% more carbon was retained in these treatments relative to the clearcut treatment. Fine roots also decomposed faster with increasing distance from retention patches or retention trees as decomposition was twofold slower in the aggregate centre relative to open areas, with similar patterns observed in the dispersed retention treatment. However, fine roots decomposed at similar rates in forests and stands with more advanced regeneration, suggesting the effects of harvesting on decomposition rates was not persistent. Across all sampling locations, 37% of the variation in fine-root carbon loss was explained by fine-root biomass, and nitrate, potassium and sulphate availability. Nitrate availability was also positively correlated with the proportional mass of carbon lost during the decomposition experiment, suggesting that fine-root decomposition is sensitive to harvesting-induced changes in soil physicochemistry, and that variable-retention harvesting moderates the effects of harvesting on decomposition rates. These findings indicate that shortly after harvest, retention of even single trees can prevent the increase in fine-root decomposition rates associated with clearcut harvesting in these coastal Douglas-fir forests. Accordingly, management practices such as variable-retention harvesting that retain some trees in a cutblock may reduce soil C losses following forest harvesting. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Plantations play an important role in mitigating climate change through assimilating atmospheric CO2. However, the mechanisms by which increasing N additions affect net ecosystem production (NEP) of plantations remain poorly understood. A field experiment was initialized in May 2009, which incorporated additions of four rates of N (control (no N addition), low-N (5 g N m-2 yr-1), medium-N (10 g N m -2 yr-1), and high-N (15 g N m-2 yr -1)) at the Saihanba Forestry Center, Hebei Province, northern China, a locality that contains the largest area of plantations in China. Net primary production (NPP), soil respiration, and its autotrophic and heterotrophic components were measured. Plant tissue carbon (C) and N concentrations (including foliage, litter, and fine roots), microbial biomass, microbial community composition, extracellular enzyme activities, and soil pH were also measured. N addition significantly increased NPP, which was associated with increased litter N concentrations. Autotrophic respiration (AR) increased but heterotrophic respiration (HR) decreased in the high N compared with the medium N plots, although the HR in high and medium N plots did not significantly differ from that in the control. The increased AR may derive from mycorrhizal respiration and rhizospheric microbial respiration, not live root respiration, because fine root biomass and N concentrations showed no significant differences. Although the HR was significantly suppressed in the high-N plots, soil microbial biomass, composition, or activity of extracellular enzymes were not significantly changed. Reduced pH with fertilization also could not explain the pattern of HR. The reduction of HR may be related to altered microbial C use efficiency. NEP was significantly enhanced by N addition, from 149 to 426.6 g C m-2 yr-1. Short-term N addition may significantly enhance the role of plantations as an important C sink. {\textcopyright} 2014 Du et al.},

Species in ten genera, Anthonotha, Aphanocalyx, Berlinia, Didelotia, Gilbertiodendron, Julbernardia, Microberlinia, Monopetalanthus, Tetraberlinia(tribe Amherstieae) and Afzelia(tribe Detarieae) were ectomycorrhizal. These species were not uniformly distributed in the forest, and three large emergent species Microberlinia bisulcata A. Chev., Tetraberlinia bifoliolata(Harms) Hauman, and T. moreliana Aubr. in particular appear to form groves c. 600 m across. This type of distribution may be related to the ectomycorrhizal habit. A previous large scale enumeration and soil survey on four 5 km transects of plots in the forest, carried out during the wet season, had revealed an association between these ectomycorrhizal legumes and low concentrations ( 5 $\mu$g g‐1) of extractable phosphorus in the mineral soil. In the current study part of one of the original transects in a low phosphorus area of the forest, where ectomycorrhizal trees comprise 29 % of the basal area, was resampled at the subplot level during the dry season. Whereas in the wet season soil phosphorus had been lower (2{\textperiodcentered}8 $\mu$g g‐1) within the ectomycorrhizal groves than without (3{\textperiodcentered}8 $\mu$g g‐1), in the dry season the situation was reversed and the overall concentrations were higher (12{\textperiodcentered}3 and 7{\textperiodcentered}9 $\mu$g g‐1 respectively). Ordination analysis re‐affirmed the association of the three Microberlina/Tetraberlinia species with relatively low concentrations of extractable phosphorus in the wet season but relatively high ones in the dry season. The groves are characterized by high inputs of leaf litter in the dry season, extensive colonization of surface organic matter by ectomycorrhizas and hyphal strands, and high carbon: extractable inorganic phosphorus ratios in the mineral soil in the wet season. These features are discussed in relation to the presumed ability of ectomycorrhizas to utilize organic phosphorus. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1988, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract = {15N natural abundances of soil total N, roots and mycorrhizas were studied in surface soil profiles in coniferous and broadleaved forests along a transect from central to northern Europe. Under conditions of N limitation in Sweden, there was an increase in $\delta$15N of soil total N of up to 9%, from the uppermost horizon of the organic mor layer down to the upper 0-5 cm of the mineral soil. The $\delta$15N of roots was only slightly lower than that of soil total N in the upper organic horizon, but further down roots were up to 5‰ depleted under such conditions. In experimentally N-enriched forest in Sweden, i.e. in plots which have received an average of c. 100 kg N ha-1 year-1 for 20 years and which retain less than 50% of this added N in the stand and the soil down to 20 cm depth, and in some forests in central Europe, the increase in $\delta$15N with depth in soil total N was smaller. An increase in $\delta$15N of the surface soil was even observed on experimentally N-enriched plots, although other data suggest that the N fertilizer added was depleted in 15N. In such cases roots could be enriched in 15N relative to soil total N, suggesting that labelling of the surface soil is via the pathway: - available pools of N plant N - litter N. Under N-limiting conditions roots of different species sampled from the same soil horizon showed similar $\delta$15N. By contrast, in experimentally N-enriched forest $\delta$15N of roots increased in the sequence: ericaceous dwarf shrubs<Scots pine<grass, suggesting increasing use of inorganic N along the sequence. Complementary studies at the major transect sites had shown that 90-99% of fine tree roots had ectomycorrhizas (ECMs). ECMs were 2‰ more enriched than corresponding non-mycorrhizal fine roots. Fungal sheaths stripped off ECMs were 2.4-6.4‰ enriched relative to the remaining root core. It is suggested that a flux of N through ECMs to aboveground parts in N-limited forests would leave 15N enriched compounds in fungal material, which could contribute to explain the observed $\delta$15N profiles if fungal material is enriched, because it is a precursor of stable organic matter and recalcitrant N. This could act in addition to the previous explanation of the isotopically lighter soil surface in forests: plant uptake of 15N-depleted N and its redeposition onto the soil surface by litter-fall.},

abstract = {Diversity and storage function of mycorrhiza as well as soil organoprofile formation were investigated in a chronosequence of a pure Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand, of Scots pine stands that were underplanted with beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and in three pure beech stands of different age. Mycorrhiza diversity was higher in the pure beech stands compared to the pure pine stand. Beech and pine trees in the mixed stands had similar dominant mycorrhiza morphotypes. However, trees in two of the three pure beech stands were mycorrhized with other types. Mycorrhizal abundance and nutrient amounts of mycorrhizae associated with beech trees were higher in the mixed and in the pure beech stands compared to pine mycorrhizae indicating that nutrient uptake was higher in older beech than in older pine trees. Humus quality varied from pine to beech stands. Plant litter storage in the humus layer was highest in the youngest mixed stand and lowest in the oldest beech stand. Humus forms changed from moder grass-type in the pure Scots pine stand to mor-like moder and moder rich in fine humus with increasing age of beeches in the mixed stands. The older beech stands were characterised by oligomull and mull-like moder as the dominating humus forms. The ecologically favourable humus forms, i.e., nutrient rich humus forms in the older beech stands correlate well with the higher mycorrhizal diversity and abundance as well as the higher nutrient storage of their mycorrhizae in these stands. The results are also discussed with regard to the 'base-pump effect' of beech trees. {\textcopyright} 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

In higher mountain altitudes more temperate species can be found in habitats with an ecology similar to that in the temperate zone. Most of the members of the fungal vegetation collected in the pine plantations (mycorrhizal, litter decomposing wood inhabiting species) may have been introduced from foreign areas from which the planted trees came.

abstract = {The importance of developing multi-disciplinary approaches to solving problems relating to anthropogenic pollution is now clearly appreciated by the scientific community, and this is especially evident in boreal ecosystems exposed to escalating threats of petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) contamination through expanded natural resource extraction activities. This review aims to synthesize information regarding the fate and behaviour of PHCs in boreal forest soils in both ecological and sustainable management contexts. From this, we hope to evaluate potential management strategies, identify gaps in knowledge and guide future research. Our central premise is that mycorrhizal systems, the ubiquitous root symbiotic fungi and associated food-web communities, occupy the structural and functional interface between decomposition and primary production in northern forest ecosystems (i.e. underpin survival and productivity of the ecosystem as a whole), and, as such, are an appropriate focal point for such a synthesis. We provide pertinent basic information about mycorrhizas, followed by insights into the ecology of ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal systems. Next, we review the fate and behaviour of PHCs in forest soils, with an emphasis on interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and associated bacteria. Finally, we summarize implications for ecosystem management. Although we have gained tremendous insights into understanding linkages between ecosystem functions and the various aspects of mycorrhizal diversity, very little is known regarding rhizosphere communities in PHC-contaminated soils. This makes it difficult to translate ecological knowledge into environmental management strategies. Further research is required to determine which fungal symbionts are likely to survive and compete in various ecosystems, whether certain fungal - plant associations gain in ecological importance following contamination events, and how PHC contamination may interfere with processes of nutrient acquisition and exchange and metabolic processes. Research is also needed to assess whether the metabolic capacity for intrinsic decomposition exists in these ecosystems, taking into account ecological variables such as presence of other organisms (and their involvement in syntrophic biodegradation), bioavailability and toxicity of mixtures of PHCs, and physical changes to the soil environment. {\textcopyright} 2007 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

abstract = {Fungi are vital within forest ecosystems through their mycorrhizal relationships with trees, and as the main agents of wood decomposition and thus carbon and nutrient cycling. Globally, forests are becoming increasingly fragmented, creating forest patches that are isolated, reduced in area, and exposed at edges. Edges are often ecologically distinct from the forest interior due to their exposure to the matrix habitat. This exposure can result in altered microclimatic conditions and flows of biotic and abiotic materials such as spores or inorganic nitrogen, respectively.Although fungi are known to be affected by microclimate and nitrogen deposition, knowledge of forest edge effects on fungi is extremely limited; however, a consideration of the factors known to regulate fungal activity in combination with known biotic and abiotic edge effects implies that forest edges are likely to strongly influence fungi. These include responses of fungi to the altered microclimate and nitrogen levels at forest edges, at both the individual and community level; interactions with plants and animals that have been influenced by edges; above-belowground feedback between mycorrhizal fungi and host trees. The small body of existing research focuses on fruit body presence and distribution; fungal biomass and community composition in soil have been touched upon. Positive, negative and neutral edge responses have been found, the majority of studies finding a significant effect on some of the parameters measured. Generally, abundance of fruit bodies and biomass in the soil is lower at the forest edge.Understanding how fungi respond to edges is essential to a more complete knowledge of carbon and nitrogen cycling in forest edges, influence of mycorrhizal species on vegetation, and conservation of rare fungi. As edges become increasingly dominant landscape features it is vital to investigate processes within them, to understand ecosystem function at a landscape scale. {\textcopyright} 2012 The British Mycological Society.},

abstract = {The supply of nitrogen commonly limits plant production in boreal forests and also affects species composition and ecosystem functions other than plant growth. These interrelations vary across the landscapes, with the highest N availability, plant growth and plant species richness in ground-water discharge areas (GDAs), typically in toe-slope positions, which receive solutes leaching from the much larger groundwater recharge areas (GRAs) uphill. Plant N sources include not only inorganic N, but, as heightened more recently, also organic N species. In general, also the ratio inorganic N over organic N sources increase down hillslopes. Here, we review recent evidence about the nature of the N limitation and its variations in Fennoscandian boreal forests and discuss its implications for forest ecology and management. The rate of litter decomposition has traditionally been seen as the determinant of the rate of N supply. However, while N-rich litter decomposes faster than N-poor litter initially, N-rich litter then decomposes more slowly, which means that the relation between N % of litter and its decomposability is complex. Moreover, in the lower part of the mor-layer, where the most superficial mycorrhizal roots first appear, and N availability matters for plants, the ratio of microbial N over total soil N is remarkably constant over the wide range in litter and soil C/N ratios of between 15 and 40 for N-rich and N-poor sites, respectively. Nitrogen-rich and -poor sites thus differ in the sizes of the total N pool and the microbial N pool, but not in the ratio between them. A more important difference is that the soil microbial N pool turns over faster in N-rich systems because the microbes are more limited by C, while microbes in N-poor systems are a stronger sink for available N. Furthermore, litter decomposition in the most superficial soil horizon (as studied by the so-called litter-bag method) is associated with a dominance of saprotrophic fungi, and absence of mycorrhizal fungi. The focal zone in the context of plant N supply in N-limited forests is further down the soil profile, where ectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots become abundant. Molecular evidence and stable isotope data indicate that in the typical N-poor boreal forests, nitrogen is retained in saprotrophic fungi, likely until they run out of energy (available C-compounds). Then, as heightened by recent research, ECM fungi, which are supplied by photosynthate from the trees, become the superior competitors for N. In N-poor boreal soils strong N retention by microorganisms keeps levels of available N very low. This is exacerbated by an increase in tree C allocation to mycorrhizal fungi (TCAM) relative to net primary production (NPP) with decreasing soil N supply, which causes ECM fungi to retain much of the available soil N for their own growth and transfer little to their tree hosts. The transfer of N through the ECM fungi, and not the rate of litter decomposition, is likely limiting the rate of tree N supply under such conditions. All but a few stress-tolerant less N-demanding plant species, like the ECM trees themselves and ericaceous dwarf shrubs, are excluded. With increasing N supply, a weakening of ECM symbiosis caused by the relative decline in TCAM contributes to shifts in soil microbial community composition from fungal dominance to bacterial dominance. Thus, bacteria, which are less C-demanding, but more likely to release N than fungi, take over. This, and the relatively high pH in GDA, allow autotrophic nitrifying bacteria to compete successfully for the NH4 + released by C-limited organisms and causes the N cycle to open up with leaching of nitrate (NO3 −) and gaseous N losses through denitrification. These N-rich conditions allow species-rich communities of N-demanding plant species. Meanwhile, ECM fungi have a smaller biomass, are supplied with N in excess of their demand and will export more N to their host trees. Hence, the gradient from low to high N supply is characterized by profound variations in plant and soil microbial physiologies, especially their relations to the C-to-N supply ratio. We propose how interactions among functional groups can be understood and modelled (the plant-microbe carbon-nitrogen model). With regard to forest management these perspectives explain why the creation of larger tree-free gaps favors the regeneration of tree seedlings under N-limited conditions through reduced belowground competition for N, and why such gaps are less important under high N supply (but when light might be limiting). We also discuss perspectives on the relations between N supply, biodiversity, and eutrophication of boreal forests from N deposition or forest fertilization. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors},

abstract = {Soil food webs play an important role in forest ecosystem functions that may be sensitive to global environmental change. We traced a pulse of 13C from the root systems of young sugar maple stands through the soil food web to explore energy flow from roots to soil heterotrophs. Invasive earthworms (Lumbricidae) were the most highly-enriched taxa sampled, indicating that they were consuming significant quantities of live fine roots and mycorrhizae and assimilating significant amounts of root-derived C. Another invasive invertebrate, a weevil (Barypeithes pellucidus) also appeared to consume significant amounts of roots or root-derived C. High isotope enrichment in ants (Formicidae) may reflect their feeding on phloem-sucking coccids in soil. All the predators collected from the litter layer also exhibited high isotope enrichment, including the salamander Plethodon cinereus. Moreover, in the absence of invasive earthworms all the taxa of animals collected from surface soil were similarly highly-enriched in root-derived isotopes. The apparent importance of the root channel in supplying energy to the soil food web suggests that forest ecosystem functions could be highly sensitive to global changes that alter proportional tree C allocation belowground. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

These fungi were compared with those on leaves of Magnolia liliifera, the supportive plant, using data from previous studies at the same site. Leaves of B. floribunda were placed with the upper or lower leaf surface adjacent to the forest floor, hung above the ground either under the host tree or other tree species, or placed on the forest floor under the host tree or under other trees to establish the effects of these treatments. These leaf bait trials did not affect the fungal diversity on the leaves. There was very little overlap between fungi on the climber leaves and those on the support tree. Only four saprobes from B. floribunda were also found on leaves of M. liliifera.

abstract = {The availability and the quality of substrates are important drivers of macrofungal biogeography, and thus macrofungal species occurrence is potentially dependent on the availability of different substrates. However, few studies have explored the properties of macrofungal substrates and assessed the relationship between macrofungal diversity and substrate diversity at a landscape level. To address this issue, we conducted a landscape-scale survey of basidiocarp substrates in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). A total of 957 macrofungal species distributed across 73 families and 189 genera were collected. Substrates of these macrofungi were categorized into four main groups (namely, litter, soil, root, and rare substrates) and referenced into 14 sub-substrate types (such as branches, leaves, and fruit). The results revealed that 50% of the observed macrofungal species were symbiotrophs living in ectomycorrhizal association with plant hosts, 30% were saprotrophs decomposing plant litter, 15% lived in soil organic matter, and 5% lived in rare substrates. The most abundant root symbiotic fungi were members of Russula, whereas most litter saprotrophic fungi belonged to Marasmius. Macrofungi commonly favored a single substrate. This specificity was not affected by changes in vegetation or climate. Less than 1% of macrofungi (e.g., Marasmius aff. maximus) could live on multiple substrates. Most of these unusual macrofungi were characterized as highly mobile and were generally found in successional areas. In secondary forests, our survey indicated that significant correlations exist between substrate preference and taxonomic diversity, reflected as higher substrate diversity generally accompanied by higher macrofungal diversity. In conclusion, substrate preference is an important factor driving macrofungal composition and distribution in the GMS. Macrofungi that thrive on multiple substrates constitute pioneer groups that have an important role in establishing macrofungal communities in new habitats. These observations have furthered our understanding of how substrate preferences could explain macrofungal biogeography. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

The niche effect (as organic soil, mineral soil or dead woody debris artificially introduced in the soil) on the ECM community structure and on the potential catabolic activities of the most abundant morphotypes was studied. The morphotypes in each niche were subjected to enzymatic tests developed for hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes involved in the decomposition of organic compounds. The ECM community structure varied widely depending on the soil horizon or habitat patch. The species richness was higher in the A1 horizon than in the other niches. Different ECM species had different activity patterns for the eight enzymatic tests while co-occurring in the same niche. Catabolic activities also changed within species between niches. Dead woody debris were extensively colonized by two saprotrophic fungi (Megacollybia platyphylla and Armillaria sp.) and, in this particular niche, ECM morphotypes predominantly belonged to the genera Lactarius and Tomentella. These morphotypes showed high chitinase activities. This study suggested also that some ECM fungi could obtain nutrients via the chitin degradation of dead or live saprobes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The primary objective of this paper is to study the interspecific variation of 15N natural abundance in two dominant conifer tree species, Scot pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) in a N-limited mixed boreal coniferous forest in southern Finland. Both a mature tree stand (a natural forest stand) and a stand of seedlings in a clear-cut area were considered. We analyzed %N and $\delta$15N natural abundance in needles, branches, litter and soil of the both above-mentioned stands. Pine needles had higher N concentrations than spruce needles, both in mature forest (pine = 1.09%, SE ± 0.02 and spruce = 0.79%, SE ± 0.02) and in the clear-cut area (pine = 1.01%, SE ± 0.07 and spruce = 0.74%, SE ± 0.04). Furthermore, pine needles were significantly more depleted in $\delta$15N natural abundance than the spruce needles, both in the mature forest (pine = -5.6%o, SE ± 0.1%o and spruce = -4.0%, SE ± 0.2%o) and in the clear-cut sites (pine = -2.8%o, SE + 0.2%o and spruce = -2.1%o, SE ± 0.3%o). The more pronounced depletion of 15N in the pine foliage might be connected to its different fungal associates in the roots compared to spruce roots. We assume that the mycorrhizal N-uptake is very prominent at the N-limited site. After clear-cutting, needles of the seedlings and the uppermost part of soil organic layer were found to be more 15N-enri-ched than at the natural forest site. This was attributed to an increased level of nitrification in the clear-cut site soil.},

abstract = {Elevational gradients strongly affect microbial biodiversity in bulk soil through altering plant and soil properties, but the effects on rhizosphere microbial patterns remain unclear, especially at large spatial scales. We therefore designed an elevational gradient experiment to examine rhizosphere microbial (bacteria, fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) diversity and composition using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA and ITS genes for comparison to plant and soil properties. Our results showed that bacterial and fungal alpha diversity was significantly higher at mid-elevation, while AMF alpha diversity decreased monotonically. The beta diversities of the three groups were significantly affected by elevational gradients, but the effect on bacterial beta diversity was larger than on fungal and AMF beta diversity. Proteobacteria, the dominant phyla of bacteria, was significantly higher at the mid-elevation, while Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria significantly decreased as elevation increased. The main fungal taxa, Basidiomycota, significantly decreased with elevation, and Ascomycota significantly increased with elevation. Glomeromycota, the dominant AMF phyla, responded insignificantly to the elevational gradients. The responses of bacterial and fungal alpha diversity were mostly associated with tree diversity and organic carbon, whereas AMF alpha diversity mainly depended on litter N and P. Changes in bacterial community composition along the elevational gradient were explained primarily by litter N and P, and litter P was the main driver of fungal and AMF community composition. Overall, our results suggest that plant litter, particularly litter N and P, were the main source of external carbon input and drove the observed differences in rhizosphere microbial diversity and community composition. Our results highlight the importance of litter nutrition in structuring rhizosphere microbial communities in mountain ecosystems. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020 Guo, Ren, Yi, Doughty and Zhao.},

abstract = {Carbon sequestration below ground depends on organic matter input and decomposition, but regulatory bottlenecks remain unclear. The relative importance of plant production, climate and edaphic factors has to be elucidated to better predict carbon storage in forests. In Swedish forest soil inventory data from across the entire boreal latitudinal range (n = 2378), the concentration of exchangeable manganese was singled out as the strongest predictor (R2 = 0.26) of carbon storage in the extensive organic horizon (mor layer), which accounts for one third of the total below ground carbon. In comparison, established ecosystem models applied on the same data have failed to predict carbon stocks (R2 < 0.05), and in our study manganese availability overshadowed both litter production and climatic factors. We also identified exchangeable potassium as an additional strong predictor, however strongly correlated with manganese. The negative correlation between manganese and carbon highlights the importance of Mn-peroxidases in oxidative decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter. The results support the idea that the fungus-driven decomposition could be a critical factor regulating humus carbon accumulation in boreal forests, as Mn-peroxidases are specifically produced by basidiomycetes. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract = {The majority of nitrogen in forest soils is found in organic matter-protein complexes. Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are thought to have a key role in decomposing and mobilizing nitrogen from such complexes. However, little is known about the mechanisms governing these processes, how they are regulated by the carbon in the host plant and the availability of more easily available forms of nitrogen sources. Here we used spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome profiling to examine how the presence or absence of glucose and/or ammonium regulates decomposition of litter material and nitrogen mobilization by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus. We found that the assimilation of nitrogen and the decomposition of the litter material are triggered by the addition of glucose. Glucose addition also resulted in upregulation of the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in oxidative degradation of polysaccharides and polyphenols, peptidases, nitrogen transporters and enzymes in pathways of the nitrogen and carbon metabolism. In contrast, the addition of ammonium to organic matter had relatively minor effects on the expression of transcripts and the decomposition of litter material, occurring only when glucose was present. On the basis of spectroscopic analyses, three major types of chemical modifications of the litter material were observed, each correlated with the expression of specific sets of genes encoding extracellular enzymes. Our data suggest that the expression of the decomposition and nitrogen assimilation processes of EMF can be tightly regulated by the host carbon supply and that the availability of inorganic nitrogen as such has limited effects on saprotrophic activities. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Microbial Ecology.},

Leaf litter of four ectomycorrhizal tree species (Berlinia bracteosa, Didelotia africana, Microberlinia bisulcata and Tetraberlinia bifoliolata) and of three non-ectomycorrhizal species (Cola verticillata, Oubanguia alata and Strephonema pseudocola) from Korup were left to decompose in 2-mm mesh bags on the forest floor in three plots of each of two forest types forest of low (LEM) and high (HEM) abundance of ectomycorrhizal (caesalp) trees. The litter of the ectomycorrhizal species decayed at a significantly slower rate than that of the non-ectomycorrhizal species, although the former were richer in P and N concentrations of the start. Disappearance rates of the litter layer showed a similar trend. Ectomycorrhizal species immobilized less N, but mineralized more P, than non-ectomycorrhizal species. Differences between species groups in K, Mg and Ca mineralization were negligible. Effect of forest type was clear only for Mg: mineralization of Mg was faster in the HEM than LEM plots, a pattern repeated across all species. This difference was attributed to a much more prolific fine root mat in the HEM than LEM forest. The relatively fast release of P from the litter of the ectomycorrhizal species suggests that the mat must allow an efficient uptake to maintain P in the forest ecosystem.},

abstract = {Natural abundances of nitrogen isotopes, $\delta$15N, indicate that, in the same habitat, Alaskan Picea glauca and P. mariana use a different soil nitrogen compartment from the evergreen shrub Vaccinium vitis-idaea or the deciduous grass Calamagrostis canadensis. The very low $\delta$15N values (-7.7 ‰) suggest that (1) Picea mainly uses inorganic nitrogen (probably mainly ammonium) or organic N in fresh litter, (2) Vaccinium (-4.3 ‰) with its ericoid mycorrhizae uses more stable organic matter, and (3) Calamagrostis (+0.9 ‰) exploits deeper soil horizons with higher $\delta$15N values of soil N. We conclude that species limited by the same nutrient may coexist by drawing on different pools of soil N in a nutrient-deficient environment. The differences among life-forms decrease with increasing N availability. The different levels of $\delta$15N are associated with different nitrogen concentrations in leaves, Picea having a lower N concentration (0.62 mmol g-1) than Vaccinium (0.98 mmol g-1) or Calamagrostis (1.33 mmol g-1). An extended vector analysis by Timmer and Armstrong (1987) suggests that N is the most limiting element for Picea in this habitat, causing needle yellowing at N concentrations below 0.5 mmol g-1 or N contents below 2 mmol needle-1. Increasing N supply had an exponential effect on twig and needle growth. Phosphorus, potassium and magnesium are at marginal supply, but no interaction between ammonium supply and needle Mg concentration could be detected. Calcium is in adequate supply on both calcareous and acidic soils. The results are compared with European conditions of excessive N supply from anthropogenic N depositions. {\textcopyright} 1994 Springer Verlag.},

abstract = {The cycling of phosphorus was studied in a 3-year-old plantation of Acacia holosericea (1111 trees ha-1). Over a 13-month period, the gross demand by the plantation for phosphorus was estimated to be 1260 g ha-1. Of this, 17% was supplied through biochemical cycling within the plants and the balance was obtained from the soil. Of the total phosphorus in the phyllodes, approximately 85% was remobilized into the tree before phyllode fall. A total of 148 g P ha-1 was estimated to be cycled in litter over the study period. Topsoil samples collected from several points within the Eucalyptus tetrodonta open-forest contained three mycorrhizal Endogone spore types. Type GE1 appeared to be a strain of Gigaspora gilmoreii, type GE2 was an undescribed Gigaspora species and type GE3 was similar to Gigaspora gigantea. Only one sporocarpic Endogone species was found which was similar to Sclerocystis coremioides. Type GE1 was the dominant type in the E. tetrodonta open-forest and significantly greater numbers of it occurred around the roots of native legumes in a survey which included Brachysema uniflora, Calopogonium mucunioides, Galactia tenuiflora, Acacia aulacocarpa, A. holosericea, A. latescens, A. torulosa and A. yirrkallensis. All the plants examined except Eucalyptus tetrodonta, Calytrix laricina and Rhychelytrum repens were infected by vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The results of this study suggest that the infection of plant species by mycorrhizal fungi is a prerequisite for successful long-term vegetation establishment on areas rehabilitated after mining. {\textcopyright} 1982 CSIRO.

abstract = {The relative roles of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic communities in controlling the decomposition of soil organic matter remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis that ECM community structure and activity influences the breakdown of nutrient-rich biopolymers in soils, while saprotrophic communities primarily regulate the breakdown of carbon-rich biopolymers. To test this hypothesis, we used high-throughput techniques to measure ECM and saprotrophic community structure, soil resource availability, and extracellular enzyme activity in whole soils and on ECM root tips in a coastal pine forest. We found that ECM and saprotroph richness did not show spatial structure and did not co-vary with any soil resource. However, species richness of ECM fungi explained variation in the activity of enzymes targeting recalcitrant N sources (protease and peroxidase) in bulk soil. Activity of carbohydrate- and organic P- targeting enzymes (e.g. cellobiohydrolase, $\beta$-glucosidase, $\alpha$-glucosidase, hemicellulases, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, and acid phosphatase) was correlated with saprotroph community structure and soil resource abundance (total soil C, N, and moisture), both of which varied along the soil profile. These observations suggest independent roles of ECM fungi and saprotrophic fungi in the cycling of N-rich, C-rich, and P-rich molecules through soil organic matter. Enzymatic activity on ECM root tips taken from the same soil cores used for bulk enzyme analysis did not correlate with the activity of any enzyme measured in the bulk soil, suggesting that ECM contributions to larger-scale soil C and nutrient cycling may occur primarily via extramatrical hyphae outside the rhizosphere. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {The response of temperate forest ecosystems to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations is important because these ecosystems represent a significant component of the global carbon cycle. Two important but not well understood processes which elevated CO2 may substantially alter in these systems are regeneration and nitrogen cycling. If elevated CO2 leads to changes in species composition in regenerating forest communities then the structure and function of these ecosystems may be affected. In most temperate forests, nitrogen appears to be a limiting nutrient. If elevated CO2 leads to reductions in nitrogen cycling through increased sequestration of nitrogen in plant biomass or reductions in mineralization rates, long-term forest productivity may be constrained. To study these processes, we established mesocosms of regenerating forest communities in controlled environments maintained at either ambient (375 ppm) or elevated (700 ppm) CO2 concentrations. Mesocosms were constructed from intact monoliths of organic forest soil. We maintained these mesocosms for 2 years without any external inputs of nitrogen and allowed the plants naturally present as seeds and rhizomes to regenerate. We used 15N pool dilution techniques to quantify nitrogen fluxes within the mesocosms at the end of the 2 years. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration significantly affected a number of plant and soil processes in the experimental regenerating forest mesocosms. These changes included increases in total plant biomass production, plant C/N ratios, ectomycorrhizal colonization of tree fine roots, changes in tree fine root architecture, and decreases in plant NH4/+ uptake rates, gross NH4/+ mineralization rates, and gross NH4/+ consumption rates. In addition, there was a shift in the relative biomass contribution of the two dominant regenerating tree species; the proportion of total biomass contributed by white birch (Betula papyrifera) decreased and the proportion of total biomass contributed by yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis) increased. However, elevated CO2 had no significant effect on the total amount of nitrogen in plant and soil microbial biomass. In this study we observed a suite of effects due to elevated CO2, some of which could lead to increases in potential long term growth responses to elevated CO2, other to decreases. The reduced plant NH4/+ uptake rates we observed are consistent with reduced NH4/+ availability due to reduced gross mineralization rates. Reduced NH4/+ mineralization rates are consistent with the increases in C/N ratios we observed for leaf and fine root material. Together, these data suggest the positive increases in plant root architectural parameters and mycorrhizal colonization may not be as important as the potential negative effects of reduced nitrogen availability through decreased decomposition rates in a future atmosphere with elevated CO2.},

abstract = {Plant nutrient-acquisition strategies drive soil processes and vegetation performance, but their effect on the soil microbiome remains poorly understood. This knowledge is important to predict the shifts in microbial diversity and functions due to increasing changes in vegetation traits under global change. Here we documented the topsoil microbiomes of 145 boreal and temperate terrestrial sites in the Baltic region that broadly differed in vegetation type and nutritional traits, such as mycorrhizal types and symbiotic nitrogen-fixation. We found that sites dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) vegetation harbor relatively more AM fungi, bacteria, fungal saprotrophs, and pathogens in the topsoil compared with sites dominated by ectomycorrhizal (EM) plants. These differences in microbiome composition reflect the rapid nutrient cycling and negative plant–soil feedback in AM soils. Lower fungal diversity and bacteria : fungi ratios in EM-dominated habitats are driven by monodominance of woody vegetation as well as soil acidification by EM fungi, which are associated with greater diversity and relative abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes. Our study suggests that shifts in vegetation related to global change and land use may strongly alter the topsoil microbiome structure and function. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

abstract = {Carbon and mineral cycling in sustainable forest systems depends on a microbiome of basidiomycetes, ascomycetes, litter-degrading saprobes, ectomycorrhizal, and mycoparasitic fungi that constitute a deadwood degrading consortium. The brown rot basidiomycete Fomitopsis pinicola (Swartz: Fr.) P. Karsten (Fp), as an oxalate-producing facultative pathogen, is an early colonizer of wounded trees and fresh deadwood. It replaces basidiomycetous white rot fungi and nonbasidiomycetous fungal phyla in the presence of its volatilome, but poorly in its absence. With the goal of determining its dominance over the most competitive basidiomycetes and its role in fungal successions within the forest microbiome in general, Fp was exposed to the white rot fungus Kuehneromyces mutabilis (Schaeff.: Fr.) Singer & Smith (Km) in aseptic dual culture established on fertilized 100 mm-long wood dust columns in glass tubes with the inclusion of their volatilomes. For the mycelia approaching from the opposite ends of the wood dust columns, the energygenerating systems of laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP), the virulence factor oxalate, and the exhalation of terpenes were determined by spectrophotometry, High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Km mycelia perceived the approaching Fp over 20 mm of non-colonized wood dust, reduced the laccase activity to 25%, and raised MnP to 275%-500% by gaining energy and presumably by controlling oxalate, H2O2, and the dropping substrate pH caused by Fp. On mycelial contact, Km stopped Fp, secured its substrate sector with 4 mm of an impermeable barrier region during an eruption of antimicrobial bisabolenes, and dropped from the invasion mode of substrate colonization into the steady state mode of low metabolic and defensive activity. The approaching Fp raised the oxalate production throughout to > 20g kg-1 to inactivate laccase and caused, with pH 1.4-1.7, lethal conditions in its substrate sector whose physiological effects on Km could be reproduced with acidity conditions incited by HCl. After a mean lag phase of 11 days, Fp persisting in a state of high metabolic activity overgrew and digested the debilitated Km thallus and terminated the production of oxalate. It is concluded that the factors contributing to the competitive advantage of F. pinicola in the colonization of wounded trees and pre-infected deadwood are the drastic long-term acidification of the timber substrate, its own insensitivity to extremely low pH conditions, its efficient control of the volatile mono-and sesquiterpenes of timber and microbial origin, and the action of a undefined blend of terpenes and allelopathic substances. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the author.

The dominant metals in the humus layer were As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Pb occurred at the highest levels in a range of 80 to 8500 $\mu$g g-1 dry wt.

The decline and death of red spruce, the reduction in moss coverage, the increase in litter depth, the accumulation and solubilization of metals in the soils, the absence of mycorrhiza on spruce roots and other alterations noted since the initial ecological study suggest strongly that the forests of Camels Hump are reacting to severe stresses.

To conceptualize this role I develop the theory behind a simple index of the efficiency of soil resource acquisition by plant root systems (E). The morphological, physiological and demographic characteristics of mycorrhizae that define E appear to vary with environment and with plant community composition. This theory is elaborated with examples drawn from forest ecology literature. Some inconsistencies among observations of fine root dynamics are particularly revealing: (1) belowground carbon allocation vs soil fertility; (2) causes of root mortality; (3) root longevity vs decomposition rates. A comprehensive theory of mycorrhizal and ecosystem dynamics must await resolution of these inconsistencies and better quantitative information on mycorrhizal features affecting E. {\textcopyright} 1992 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {1. Soil micro-organisms play important roles in ecosystems and respond quickly to environmental changes. We examined how understory removal and tree girdling influence the composition of soil microbial community and the litter decomposition in two subtropical plantations. 2. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis was used to characterize soil microbial community. Redundancy analysis and principal response curves (PRC) were used to investigate the relationships between soil microbial community and environmental factors. 3. Understory removal significantly reduced the amount of fungal PLFAs, the ratio of fungal to bacterial PLFAs, and the litter decomposition but did not affect bacterial PLFAs and total PLFAs. In contrast, tree girdling did not affect the soil microbial characteristics. The changes in soil microbial community caused by understory removal were mainly attributed to the indirect effects such as increased soil temperature and soil NO3--N availability. In addition, PRC analysis showed that the relative abundance of most PLFAs increased in response to understory removal in the 2-year-old plantation but decreased in the 24-year-old plantation. 4. We propose that understory plants are important components in subtropical forest ecosystems, and play different roles in maintaining soil microbial community and driving litter decomposition processes in young vs. old plantations. The functions of understory plants should be considered in forest management and restoration. The negligible effect of tree girdling on the soil micro-organisms can be attributed to the resprouting trait and mycorrhizal interactions of Eucalyptus. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Because soil is a major reservoir of terrestrial carbon and a potential sink for atmospheric CO2, determining plant inputs to soil carbon is critical for understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics. We present a modified method to quantify the effects of global climate change on plant inputs of carbon to soil based on 13C:12C ratio ($\delta$ 13C) analyses that accounts for isotopic fractionation between inputs and newly created soil carbon. In a four-year study, the effects of elevated CO2 and temperature were determined for reconstructed Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga mensiezii (Mirb.) Franco) ecosystems in which native soil of low nitrogen content was used. The $\delta$13C patterns in litter and mineral soil horizons were measured and compared to $\delta$13C patterns in live needles, fine roots, and coarse roots. From regression analyses, we calculated the isotopic enrichment in 13C of newly incorporated soil carbon relative to needle and root carbon at 4‰ and 2‰, respectively. These enrichments must be considered when using shifts in soil $\delta$13C to calculate inputs of plant carbon into the soil, and are probably a major factor in the progressive enrichment in 13C with increasing depth in soil profiles. Relative to the total carbon in each layer, the proportion of new carbon from recent photosynthate in each soil layer was 13-15% in the A horizon, 7-9% in litter layers, and 4% in the B2 and C horizons. New carbon in the A horizon was estimated at 370 g C m-2. Carbon concentrations and new carbon in A horizons were correlated (r 2 = 0.78, n = 12), but with a slope of 0.356, indicating that about 36% of net carbon accumulation in the A horizon was from inputs via roots, root exudates or mycorrhizal fungi and 64% of carbon was derived from surface litter decomposition. Under the nitrogen-limited growth conditions used in this study, neither elevated CO2 nor temperature affected soil carbon sequestration patterns.},

abstract = {Plant nutrient acquisition strategies involving ectomycorrhizal (EcM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations, are key plant functional traits leading to distinct carbon (C) and nutrient dynamics in forests. Yet, little is known about how these strategies influence the structure and functioning of soil communities, and if such mycorrhizal effects may be more or less pronounced depending on the type of forest and various abiotic factors. Here we explore the potential interactions occurring between plant-EcM and plant-AM systems with the diverse soil organisms occurring in forest soils, and in the process draw attention to major issues that are worthy for future research directions. Based on these potential interactions, we suggest that EcM systems, especially those involving gymnosperms in colder climates, may select for a soil community with a narrow set of functions. These EcM systems may exhibit low functional redundancy, dominated by symbiotic interactions, where EcM fungi maintain low pH and high C/N conditions in order to tightly control nutrient cycling and maintain the dominance of EcM trees. By contrast, AM systems, particularly those involving deciduous angiosperm trees in mild and warmer climates, may facilitate a functionally more diverse and redundant soil community tending towards the dominance of competitive and antagonistic interactions, but also with a range of symbiotic interactions that together maintain diverse plant communities. We propose that the contrasting belowground interactions in AM and EcM systems act as extended nutrient acquisition traits that contribute greatly to the prevailing nutrient and C dynamics occurring in these systems. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Author(s)},

We used a radiocarbon (14C) tracer to test for uptake of litter carbon by ectomycorrhizal fungi as part of the Enriched Background Isotope Study (EBIS) in Oak Ridge Reservation, Tennessee. In EBIS, leaf litter from a highly 14C-labeled Quercus alba (white oak) forest was reciprocally transplanted with litter from a nearby low-labeled forest that had not been as strongly exposed to 14C. These litter transplants were conducted yearly. We measured $\Delta$14C signatures of ectomycorrhizal fungi collected from each forest four months and 2.25 years after the first litter transplant. The ectomycorrhizas were associated with white oak trees. We found no significant differences in 14C signatures of ectomycorrhizal fungi exposed to low-labeled versus high-labeled litter, indicating that less than 2% of the carbon in ectomycorrhizal biomass originated from transplanted litter. In contrast, ectomycorrhizal $\Delta$14C signatures from the high-labeled forest were 117-140‰ higher than those from the low-labeled forest. This pattern suggests that ectomycorrhizal fungi acquired most (or all) of their carbon from their host plants, probably via direct transfer of photosynthate through the roots. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The fossils investigated were not only limited to arthropods preserved in amber, but also included microorganisms, plant debris and vertebrate remains. This plethora of analyses provided important data about the ecology of the overall system, including sources of litter input into the soil and of the above-ground ecology. More precisely, they showed that most of the microfossils were those of soil organisms or organisms that participated in the ecology of the forest soil. This new discovery provided the opportunity to study the ecology of the soil as preserved in the 100 million years old Charentes amber. Indeed, the trophic links of the fossil forest soil have been reconstructed on the basis of the fossil assemblage discovered in amber outcrops and overlayed on a model ecological forest soil food web. We relied on existing phylogenetic information to discuss the absence of certain taxonomic groups in the fossilized specimens. Our synthesis shows that although the organisms of this ancient forest of Charentes were different from those of modern soils, the soil food web was organized functionally the same as modern soils. It also demonstrated that trophic links of the soil community were already diverse, including various means of predation, parasitism and organic matter decomposition. The most obvious differences are the absence of evidence for symbiotic root nitrogen fixation and mycorrhizae. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

When these events take place in forests of ectomycorrhizal trees, ectomycorrhizal fungi fruit during the late phase in the succession. Ectomycorrhizas are observed in the soils colonized by these fungi. Among these fungi, Hebeloma spp., Laccaria spp., and a few others colonize commonly in various waste sites, while Hebeloma radicosum colonizes specifically in moles' deserted middens (latrines) near their nests. The animals involved here as waste depositors or cadavers seem not to feed on the fungi and the plants but may depend on them for cleaning their own habitats, since mycorrhizas should readily remove products derived from wastes.

abstract = {Premise of research. Plant functional groups of different stages of tropical succession are adapted to distinct environments with different availabilities of such resources as light, water, and nutrients. The sites at early-successional stages commonly have low-fertility degraded soils and are colonized by fast-growing shade-intolerant plant species, while the sites at late-successional stages usually have soils with high contents of organic matter and nutrients and are colonized by slow-growing shade-tolerant plant species. In this study, we aimed to assess the strategies adopted by plants for nutrient acquisition over tropical succession. Methodology. Grassland, shrub vegetation, and secondary and mature forests of an Atlantic rain forest ecosystem in southern Brazil were studied. Fine roots were sampled to assess length density, specific root length (SRL), diameter, tissue density, root-hair length and incidence, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization. Rhizospheric and bulk soils were sampled to assess microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN); basal respiration; total and labile C; and concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg. Pivotal results. Fine roots with longer SRL, greater incidence of root hairs, longer root hairs, and greater AMF colonization were exhibited by plants in early-successional stages in contrast with plants in late-successional ones. Nutrient depletion zones were detected in the rhizospheres of plants in early-successional stages. Fine roots from the late-successional sites exhibited greater diameter and tissue density. High values for labile C, MBC, MBN, basal respiration, and the nutrient accumulation zone occurred in the rhizospheres of plants in late-successional stages in contrast with the rhizospheres of plants in early-successional ones. Conclusions. Our results suggest that early-successional plant species invest in fine roots with morphological features for a highly efficient nutrient uptake and in AMF (scavenging strategy), whereas late-successional plant species invest in other chemoheterotrophic microorganisms in the rhizosphere (mining strategy) for nutrient acquisition. {\textcopyright} 2019 by The University of Chicago.

Micro-organisms play a fundamental role in the cycling of carbon and nutrients in all ecosystems but the role of fungi in particular is pivotal in boreal forest ecosystems. Traditional models of nutrient cycling are based on methods and concepts developed in agricultural systems where microorganisms are considered primarily as nutrient processors providing plants with inorganic nutrients. The filamentous nature of fungi, their ability to translocate carbon and nutrients between different substrates and the capacity of ectomycorrhizal fungi to utilise organic nutrients have all been largely ignored. In this article, a new model is suggested which emphasises competition for organic nutrients between decomposer organisms and plants, with the plants depending on their associated mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient acquisition. Antagonistic interactions involving nutrient transfer between decomposer and mycorrhizal fungi are proposed as important pathways in nutrient cycling. Due to the nutrient conservative features of decomposer fungi, inorganic nutrients are considered less important for plant nutrition. The implications of the new nutrient cycling model on the carbon balance of boreal forests are discussed.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions have impacted terrestrial forest ecosystem processes in North America since the industrial revolution. With the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970 in the United States, atmospheric inputs of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) into forests in the Appalachian Mountains have declined, which have, potentially, mitigated their effects on processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling. Activities of microbial extracellular soil enzymes (ESEs) mediate many rate-limiting nutrient transformations in forest soils and play important roles in the decomposition of complex organic compounds. Soils in high-elevation red spruce forests are characterized by low pH and high carbon (C):N ratios and, having historically received extremely high levels of N deposition, may exhibit legacy impacts of deposition on nutrient availability and decomposition. We utilized four sites along a modeled gradient of N deposition in central Appalachia to assess contemporary ESEs in bulk soil under Acer rubrum L., Betula alleghaniensis Britt., and Picea rubens Sarg. in May, June, and July 2016. Increasing N deposition led to increases in organic fraction C and N and decreases in phosphorus (P). Sites receiving higher N also exhibited greater mineral fraction C, N, and P. ESEs were highest in organic fractions with acid phosphatases (AP) exhibiting the highest activity. There was little influence of N deposition on organic fraction ESEs, but strong evidence for a positive relationship between N deposition and activities of AP, $\beta$-glucosidases (BG), and chitinase (NAG) in mineral fractions. Species effects on ESEs were present with high AP in organic fractions under spruce and high mineral fraction fungal laccase (LAC) under birch. The sampling season demonstrated little effect on ESEs. ESEs were more strongly influenced by plot-level factors, such as tree species diversity and abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree species, than temporal or soil factors or nutrient status related to modeled cumulative N deposition across these sites. Decreases in AP, BG, and NAG activities with greater abundance of broadleaf deciduous species and increases in activities with ECM host abundance indicate that microbial communities driven by these plant functional groups are responsible for the differences in ESEs observed in these high-elevation mixed red spruce stands. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {Under a warming climate, the boreal forest could become one of the largest terrestrial net CO2 sources, as increasing disturbances and soil organic matter decomposition rates (heterotrophic respiration, Rh) could offset net primary production. Since soil represents the boreal forest's largest C pool, it is critical of correctly predicting future changes in Rh, as well as its sensitivity to temperature (Q10 of Rh). We simulated a soil warming by transplanting soil cores from boreal balsam fir (Abies balsamea, BF) and black spruce (Picea mariana, BS) stands to a more southern Eastern hemlock stand (Tsuga canadensis, EH). We measured Rh and soil properties over 3 years, from June to October. Over three snow-free seasons, soil temperature (first 10 cm, including the FH organic layers) and Rh increased for BF (+3.2 °C, +60% of Rh) and BS cores (+2.3 °C, +27% of Rh). Microbial C concentration decreased by 54–73% in the FH layers of warmed and control cores relative to initial values, despite unchanged chemically labile C, probably due to excised roots and mycorrhizal hyphae. This suggests a possible underestimation of Rh during the experiment. In BF soils only, the increase in Rh was accompanied by an increase in its sensitivity to temperature. Under a +5 °C soil warming, mean predicted Rh of BF soils would increase by 83% rather than by 56%. Relative to BS soils, such increase in sensitivity could be partly due to a higher fraction of chemically labile C (+52%) in the FH layers and a higher mean warming effect. It suggests that for BF forest soils, predicting decomposition rates for a warmer climate based on current temperature sensitivities could be inadequate. However, longer-term studies are needed to see if this increase in Q10 of Rh for BF soils would be maintained for longer periods. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Little is known of how hurricane-induced deposition of canopy material onto tropical forest floors influences the soil microbial communities involved in decomposition of these materials. In this study, to identify how soil bacterial and fungal communities might change after a hurricane, and their possible roles in the C and N cycles, soils were collected from five 2000 m2 permanent plots in Lowland, Upland and Riparian primary forests in Costa Rica 3 months before and 7 months after Hurricane Otto damaged the forests. The soil Water, inorganic N and Biomass C increased and total organic C decreased Post-Hurricane, all of which best predicted the changes in the Post-Hurricane soil microbial communities. Post-Hurricane soils from all forest types showed significant changes in community composition of total bacteria, total fungi, and five functional groups of microbes (i.e., degrading/lignin degrading, NH4+-producing, and ammonium oxidizing bacteria, and the complex C degrading/wood rot/ lignin degrading and ectomycorrhizal fungi), along with a decrease in richness in genera of all groups. As well, the mean proportion of DNA sequences (MPS) of all five functional groups increased. There were also significant changes in the MPS values of 7 different fungal and 7 different bacterial genera that were part of these functional groups. This is the first evidence that hurricane-induced deposition of canopy material is stimulating changes in the soil microbial communities after the hurricane, involving changes in specific taxonomic and functional group genera, and reduction in the community richness while selecting for dominant genera possibly better suited to process the canopy material. These changes may represent examples of taxonomic switching of functionally redundant microbial genera in response to dramatic changes in resource input. It is possible that differences in these microbial communities and genera may serve as indicators of disturbed and recovering regional soil ecosystems, and should be evaluated in the future. {\textcopyright} 2020 Eaton et al.

abstract = {Fungi are one of the most important soil microorganisms due to their abundance and the importance of the ecosystem processes they carry out, like decomposition, nutrient cycling, and the establishment of biological interactions such as mycorrhizas. Fungi can be used as bioindicators because they are highly sensitive to alterations in their surroundings, thus being useful for monitoring ecological changes and effects of human activity on natural ecosystems. Nothofagus alpina (raul{\'{i}}) is an ecologically and economically important species of South American temperate forests. It is currently included in domestication and conservation programs, and provenance trials have been installed in different ecosystems of Patagonia. These trials are ideal for studying how tree genetics might influence the associated microbiota. Afforestation with fast-growing exotic conifers (mainly Pinus ponderosa) had been promoted as an important economic activity in Patagonia, but nowadays there is an increasing interest for the establishment of mix Pinus + Nothofagus plantations instead of monospecific Pinus stands and for using Pinus plantations as refugee for assisted Nothofagus migration. The main objective of this work was to explore the structure of different fungal communities in the rhizosphere of N. alpina with different genetic diversity (high, intermediate, and low) implanted under a native Nothofagus forest and a P. ponderosa plantation. Fingerprinting based on Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis revealed differences in the structure of the rhizosphere fungal communities. Some relationships between N. alpina genetic diversity and composition of rhizosphere fungal communities were observed. In the native forest, one of the provenances (intermediate genetic diversity) was associated with the highest richness of Basidiomycetes and total fungi. In addition, individual genetic parameters of N. alpina specimens implanted in the native forest significantly correlated with Ascomycetes richness. It was also found that Basidiomycetes were the dominating fungal taxa in the native forest, and Ascomycetes in the P. ponderosa plantation. Factors as soil physicochemical characteristics and the dominant forestry species, which provide different quantity and quality of litter inputs and are associated with different ectomycorrhizal fungi, seemed to be the main factors determining this significant difference between the native forest and the plantation. Beyond highlighting the potential of applying soil fungi as bioindicators, our study contributes to understanding the relationship between host genetics and rhizosphere fungi. This information is relevant not only for conservation and restoration programs, but also for taking management decisions related with sustainable forestry and domestication of native tree species. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

During Fall 2002 we collected one soil core (5.6 cm diameter; organic horizon plus 10 cm of mineral soil) from each of four 5 m×5 m subplots within the control, low N (5 g N m-2 per year), and high N (15 g N m-2 per year) plots in both the hardwood and pine stands at the Chronic Nitrogen Amendment Study at Harvard Forest. The samples were analyzed for total and active bacterial and fungal biomass, microbial catabolic response profiles, the activities of cellulolytic and ligninolytic enzymes, and total, labile and microbially derived organic carbon (C). Live, fine roots were also collected from the control and low N pine plots and analyzed for ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition and diversity. Active fungal biomass was 27-61% and 42-69% lower in the fertilized compared to control plots in the hardwood and pine stands, respectively. Active bacterial biomass was not greatly affected by N additions, resulting in significantly lower fungal:bacterial biomass ratios in the N-treated plots. This shift in microbial community composition was accompanied by a significant reduction in the activity of phenol oxidase, a lignin-degrading enzyme produced by white-rot fungi. In the pine stand, ectomycorrhizal fungal community diversity was lower in the low N-treated plot than in the control plot. Differences in ectomycorrhizal community structure were also detected between control and fertilized pine plots, including a reduction in those species with the highest relative frequencies in the control community. Finally, N enrichment altered the pattern of microbial substrate use, with the relative response to the addition of carboxylic acids and carbohydrates being significantly lower in the N-treated plots, even after the data were normalized to account for differences in microbial biomass. These patterns are consistent with lower decomposition rates and altered N cycling observed previously at this site. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. About 10 years after establishment, plantations of Western Redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don) on northern Vancouver Island, British Columbia become nutrient deficient and chlorotic, grow slowly, and are susceptible to invasion by the ericaceous shrub Salal (Gaultheria shallon Pursh.). 2. To test the hypothesis that $\delta$15N can be related to site histories (site disturbance, soil N dynamics and plant development), we measured soil and foliar $\delta$15N in the summer of 1992 in 3-year-old (nutrient-sufficient) and 10-year-old (nutrient-deficient) plantations and in old-growth stands. The foliar and soil $\delta$15N values of the plantations and old-growth forests were different and closely reflected site histories. Salal invasion and nutrient deficiency interacted to depress the growth of Redcedar in 10-year-old plantations. 3. Site preparation destroyed the top soil organic layers (fresh and decaying litter) and forced Salal (ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal) into the humus layer, where it was in direct competition with Redcedar, thereby disadvantaging arbuscular mycorrhizal/ non-mycorrhizal Redcedar in its nutrient acquisition during a period when N and P are severely limited. 4. There was a large seasonal range of foliar $\delta$15N (5{\textperiodcentered}5 and 4{\textperiodcentered}3‰ for 10-year-old Redcedar and Salal, respectively), and there was no relationship between foliar $\delta$15N and measured rooting depth, demonstrating that rooting depths cannot be used to explain foliar $\delta$15N variation among coexisting woody taxa. 5. Foliar and soil $\delta$15N declined with site age and with a presumed change from 'open' to 'closed' N cycling; the 15N-depleting effects of mycorrhizal N transformations contributed to the observed $\delta$15N decline.},

abstract = {We studied soil organic carbon (C) chemistry at the mountain birch forest-tundra ecotone in three regions of the Fennoscandian mountain range with comparable vegetation cover but contrasting degrees of continentality and latitude. The aim of the study was to identify functional compound classes and their relationships to decomposition and spatial variation across the ecotone and latitudinal gradient. Solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (CPMAS 13C NMR) was used to identify seven functional groups of soil organic C: alkyls, N-alkyls, O-alkyls, acetals, aromatics, phenolics and carboxyls. N-alkyls, O-alkyls and acetals are generally considered labile substrates for a large number of saprotrophic fungi and bacteria, whilst phenolics and aromatics are mainly decomposed by lignolytic organisms and contribute to the formation of soil organic matter together with aliphatic alkyls and carboxyls. All soils contained a similar proportional distribution of functional groups, although relatively high amounts of N-alkyls, O-alkyls and acetals were present in comparison to earlier published studies, suggesting that large amounts of soil C were potentially vulnerable to microbial degradation. Soil organic matter composition was different at the most southerly site (Dovrefjell, Norway), compared with the two more northerly sites (Abisko, Sweden, and Joatka, Norway), with higher concentrations of aromatics and phenolics, as well as pronounced differences in alkyl concentrations between forest and tundra soils. Clear differences between mountain birch forest and tundra heath soil was noted, with generally higher concentrations of labile carbon present in tundra soils. We conclude that, although mesic soils around the forest-tundra ecotone in Fennoscandia are a potential source of C to the atmosphere in a changing environment, the response is likely to vary between comparable ecosystems in relation to latitude and continentality as well as soil properties especially soil nitrogen content and pH.},

The goal of the now presented investigation was to gather basic data regarding the actual state of mycocoenosis (qualitative and quantitative) in this area. The number of species, their abundance as well as their productivity, were recorded over the period of July 1991 to November 1993 in 6 plots situated in the area of Achenkirch (Tyrol, Austria): a subalpine spruce forest, a subalpine mixed forest, two beech woods, a Pinus stand and a ski slope. Altogether 466 basidiomycetes species were recorded, and classified in the following three main ecological groups: symbiontic mycorrhizal species, parasites and decomposers of soil, litter and wood. Special attention was taken also to the occurrence of Aphyllophorales which often are neglected in comparable studies. 133 corticoid, poroid, hydnoid and clavaroid basidiomycetes belonging to the Aphyllophorales were identified. Differences between the mycobiota of the three forest types are evident in regard of species diversity, productivity and abundance. The highest species diversity and abundance was found in the subalpine spruce forest with more than 300 fungal taxa. In the beech forests more than 200 basidiomycetes species were recorded, whereas only low species diversity was found in the Pinus stand (37 species) and on the slope (29 species). Dominant and characteristic species for each forest type are proposed and compared.},

In plots with only 13C-labelled roots most of the soil invertebrates studied were significantly depleted in 13C, e.g. earthworms, chilopods, gastropods, diplurans, collembolans, mites and isopods, indicating that these taxa predominantly obtain their carbon from belowground input. In plots with only 13C-labelled leaf litter only three taxa, including, e.g. juvenile Glomeris spp. (Diplopoda), were significantly depleted in 13C suggesting that the majority of soil invertebrates obtain its carbon from roots.

abstract = {Leaf litter chemistry and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are key drivers of the below-ground nitrogen (N) cycling within forest ecosystems. Their combined effects on litter decomposition and N competition between microbial decomposers and plants are still uncertain. We conducted a glasshouse microcosm experiment with low or high ECM-colonized beech (Fagus sylvatica) saplings, growing with litter collected from old or young beech trees growing on the same loamy soil. After 6 months of growth, we investigated litter decomposition rates, microbial respiration and the N pools within leaf litter, soil (different pools), microbial and plant shoot biomass. We found that the mass loss of the litter from young trees was always higher than the litter from the mature trees. The microbial biomass N per unit soil carbon was low when the litter, especially from mature trees, was added, suggesting that the litter provided recalcitrant compounds and limited soil microbial activity. In contrast to the ‘Gadgil effect' hypothesis, the high ECM-colonized roots increased the litter decomposition rate and N immobilization in poorly decomposable litter in comparison with the litter incubated with the low ECM-colonized roots. Finally, the high ECM-colonized plants that received the poorly decomposable leaf litter exhibited the highest shoot N amount and biomass and were associated with the lowest microbial biomass N. Two-way anovas revealed that litter and ECM fungi occurrence together impacted final particulate organic N, microbial biomass N, the amount of shoot N and shoot biomass. Four N pools are key drivers of microbial biomass N and shoot N: particulate organic N, total N, soil ammonium concentration and litter N concentration. Synthesis. Our results support the hypothesis that poorly decomposable leaf litter produced by mature beech trees and ECM fungi together decrease microbial N immobilization but increase tree N acquisition. Increasing N retention within the recalcitrant N forms in soil was identified as a key mechanism by which beech alters soil N cycling with potential positive feedbacks on its acquisition by the plant. Our result emphasizes the importance of considering within-species litter-trait variability in litter decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

abstract = {In the southern Appalachian mountains a subcanopy species, Rhododendron maximum, inhibits the establishment and survival of canopy tree seedlings. One of the mechanisms by which seedlings could be inhibited is an allelopathic effect of decomposing litter or leachate from the canopy of R. maximum (R.m.) on seed germination, root elongation, or mycorrhizal colonization. The potential for allelopathy by R.m. was tested with two bioassay species (lettuce and cress), with seeds from four native tree species, and with three ectomycorrhizal fungi. Inhibitory influences of throughfall, fresh litter, and decomposed litter (organic layer) from forest with R.m. (+R.m. sites) were compared to similar extractions made from forest without R.m. (-R.m. sites). Throughfall and leachates of the organic layer from both +R.m. and -R.m. sites stimulated germination of the bioassay species above that of the distilled water control, to a similar extent. There was an inhibitory effect of leachates of litter from +R.m. sites on seed germination and root elongation rate of both bioassay species compared with that of litter from -R.m. sites. Native tree seed stratified in forest floor material from both forest types had a slightly higher seed germination rate compared with the control. A 2-yr study of seed germination and seedling mortality of two tree species, Quercus rubra and Prunus serotina, in field plots showed no significant influence of litter or organic layer from either forest type. Incorporating R.m. leaf material into the growth medium in vitro depressed growth of one ectomycorrhizal species but did not affect two other species. Leaf material from other deciduous tree species depressed ectomycorrhizal growth to a similar or greater extent as leaf material from R.m. In conclusion, R.m. litter can have an allelopathic effect on seed germination and root elongation of bioassay species as well as some ectomycorrhizal species. However, this allelopathic affect is not manifest in field sites and is not likely to be an important cause for the inhibition of seedling survival within thickets of R.m.},

abstract = {Premise of research. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can colonize plants of different species, creating a common mycorrhizal network (CMN) connecting the roots of many plants. How the CMN affects plant performance, especially during early plant life stages, is still uncertain. We examined the seedling performance of two temperate forest wildflowers (Arisaema triphyllum and Maianthemum racemosum) with and without open access to a CMN produced by conspecific or heterospecific adult plants, under conditions of optimal watering and water stress. Methodology. We established a split-pot design, where the adult Arisaema or Maianthemum plants grew in the main portion of the pot and the seedlings of both species grew in the seedling pots within the main container but separated from the soil matrix by nylon membranes that permitted or prevented connection with the mycorrhizal network of the adult plants. We examined the seedling growth response, nutrient acquisition, and gas exchange after 3 yr of growth. Pivotal results. Connection with the CMN had little effect on seedling biomass but did result in higher seedling nutrient content. Adult plant identity affected the nutrient content for the Maianthemum seedlings. Adult plant identity did not directly affect the Arisaema seedlings, but connection with the CMN of a heterospecific adult improved leaf N content more than connection with the CMN of a conspecific adult. Water stress also impacted the seedlings differently-water-stressed Arisaema seedlings had less seedling biomass, while water-stressed Maianthemum seedlings, for example, had higher nutrient content compared with well-watered plants. The Maianthemum seedlings also exhibited the highest gas exchange rates when grown under water stress with a heterospecific adult, regardless of their connection with the CMN. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the CMN may confer both positive and negative effects on seedling performance, but the direction and magnitude of the effects will vary between plant species and can be altered under environmental stress. {\textcopyright} 2018 by The University of Chicago.

abstract = {Understanding how extraradical mycorrhizal fungal hyphae (EMH) regulate the cycling and retention of plant-assimilated carbon (C) in forest soils requires estimation of the production, mortality, and decomposition of EMH. To do this, the use of mass-balance models in combination with hyphal in-growth mesh bags (“in-growth bags”) was proposed in recent studies. However, poor knowledge on the decomposition of field-grown EMH prevents confirmation of assumed EMH decomposition dynamics. In this study, we determined the decrease in hyphal length density of field-grown EMH of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) over eight months in in-growth bags incubated in a warm-temperate Chamaecyparis obtusa forest, to study EMH decomposition under field conditions. We used exponential decay models to describe the changes in the decomposition rate of EMH over the incubation time, between EMH diameter classes, and between seasons. A rapid decrease of the decomposition rate of EMH within two months from 2.5 to 0.1 month−1 was estimated, corresponding to an increase in half-life from 0.3 to 7 months. Furthermore, significant differences in the initial maximum decomposition rate were estimated between fine (1.6 month−1; minimum half-life: 0.4 months) and coarse EMH (3.1 month−1; minimum half-life: 0.2 months) and between incubations during spring-summer (April and August; 2.7 month−1; minimum half-life: 0.3 months) and autumn-winter (October and February; 1.1 month−1; minimum half-life: 0.6 months).

abstract = {Our recent studies have demonstrated that forest litter used in a bare-root forest nursery promoted survival and growth of two-year-old Scots pine seedlings and positively shaped the development of their ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities. To determine whether the beneficial effects of litter treatment can be extended to the next growing seasons, litter-treated seedlings were outplanted to four sites with different environmental conditions: forest clear-cut (S1), area formerly polluted by emissions from nitrogen fertilizer plant (S2), abandoned agricultural land (S3) and coastal sand dunes (S4). Seedlings grown in mineral nursery soil without litter amendment served as controls. Height and survival of seedlings were measured over three consecutive years after outplanting. At the end of the third growing season, the mycorrhizal status of seedlings was assessed using DNA-based identification techniques. Litter treatment during the nursery phase significantly improved the height of seedlings at the end of the first growing season at all tested sites. In the second and third growing seasons after outplanting, the heights of litter treated seedlings remained greater compared to control seedlings at three of the four sites; however, at the abandoned agricultural site (S3), significantly lower growth of litter-treated seedlings was observed. After the third growing season, the differences in seedling heights at the forest clear-cut (S1) and the site formerly polluted by nitrogen (S2) were not statistically significant. Survival of all outplanted seedlings varied by season and study site, but litter treated seedlings showed a clear tendency towards enhanced survival. Three years after outplanting, the survival rates of litter-treated seedlings ranged from approximately 81% at S4 to 96% at S2; for control seedlings, survival rates ranged from 63% at S4 to 81% at S3. At sites S1, S2 and S4, the survival of litter-treated seedling was significantly higher. There was a substantial transformation in ECM community composition with low persistence of suilloid mycorrhizas for both litter-treated and control seedlings three years after outplanting. Two-way analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) indicated that differences in ECM fungal community composition across seedlings from different sites likely were due to site specificity rather than previous litter treatment. Our results indicated that nursery soil amended with pine forest litter creates favourable conditions for the production of pine seedlings with better root quality and high abundance of suilloid mycorrhizas, thus allowing for potential reductions in mortality after outplanting on unfavourable sites. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Industrial companies are expected to reclaim degraded land to ecosystems with equivalent land capability. This research showed the value of woody debris for reclamation of dramatically disturbed landscapes with a forest ecosystem end land use. Adding woody debris during reclamation can facilitate recovery of flora, soil nutrient cycling and water and nutrient holding capacity. Combined with forest floor material, woody debris can provide native plant propagules that would be otherwise commercially unavailable. Sites with and without woody debris on forest floor material containing identifiable litter (L), fragmented and fermented litter (F), and humus (H) (LFH), and peat mineral soil mix (peat) cover soils were studied. Within 2 years, woody debris decreased bare ground and created microsites which were positively associated with greater vegetation cover and woody plant density. Woody debris treatments had lower soil available nitrate and soil under woody debris had a lower temperature range and higher soil volumetric water content than control treatments without woody debris. Woody debris did not affect first year microbial biomass carbon or mycorrhizae, but both were greater on LFH than peat cover soil. LFH was associated with lower bare ground and greater vegetation cover, species richness, and soil phosphorus and potassium than peat cover soil, which had greater soil sulfate. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

In order to investigate how different functional groups of fungi

vertical profiles through a Pinus sylvestris forest soil. We combined
molecular identification methods with C-14 dating of the organic matter,
analyses of carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios and N-15 natural abundance
measurements.
Saprotrophic fungi were primarily confined to relatively recently (< 4
yr) shed litter components on the surface of the forest floor, where
organic carbon was mineralized while nitrogen was retained. Mycorrhizal
fungi dominated in the underlying, more decomposed litter and humus,
where they apparently mobilized N and made it available to their host
plants.
Our observations show that the degrading and nutrient-mobilizing
components of the fungal community are spatially separated. This has
important implications for biogeochemical studies of boreal forest

abstract = {Many fungi capable of forming sheathing (ecto-) mycorrhizas are associated with trees. But what are the rules governing their occurrence? Evidence from first generation woodlands/forests, where trees grow on sites that have been treeless for many years, indicates that species of fungi occurring at early stages of woodland development ('early-stage fungi') are, in due course, superseded by others ('late-stage fungi'). There is an ordered succession which seems to reflect, in large measure, the different abilities of early- and late-stage fungi to form mycorrhizas on roots growing in soils with accumulations of recalcitrant leaf litter. In second generation woodlands/forests there seems to be little evidence of early-stage fungi. This is not so surprising as it may seem, bearing in mind that their soils are already likely to have accumulations of recalcitrant litter. Instead of classifying sheathing mycorrhizal fungi by referring to the temporal stage of woodland development, it now seems more meaningful to judge them by their abilities to colonize roots in soils with or without accumulations of different types of litter. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {The purpose of this investigation was to indicate the most effective method of revitalizing degraded forest area. The different modifications of wood chips were used as a substitute for humus layer. The mites (Acari), and moss mites (Oribatida) as the bio-indicators of soil succession changes were used. The study began 2 years after planting of Scots pine seedlings on the land devastated by military activity, at the former military training ground (GPS: 53.156943N, 17.986440E). The soil on this area was in the type of rusty soils and subtype of the rusty algae soils. Scots pine seedlings were planted in spring 2011, in a distance 1.5×0.8 m. In one-factor experiment four soil mulching treatments were tested: 1. uncovered soil – control (C), 2. soil mulched with wood chips (W), 3. W + mycorrhizal preparation (WM), 4. W + forest litter (WL). Three replicates of microplots arrangement was applied. Each microplot was 5 m long with 3 rows of Scots pine. Each replication covers 10 rows. Mulching with wood chips was carried out on April 12, 2012. On October 25, 2012, the wood chips on the WM microplots were inoculated with the mycorrhizal biopreparation, and on the WL microplots, a 10% addition of fresh forest litter from the ripe fresh coniferous forest was applied. After the end of the growing season of 2012, 2013 and 2014, the measurement of the plants was carried out (the height, the root neck diameter, the length of one-year increments in the last whorl, the number of one-year increments of the last whorl and the lengths of one-year increments of the last whorl). The samples for acarological tests were collected four times. In total, 40 substrate samples with a volume of 50 cm3 each were collected from each treatment. Mites extraction was carried out for 7 days in Tullgren apparatus. Mites were identified to the order, and moss mites to the species or genus, including juvenile stages. Calculated: the average density of mites, the dominance index, the species richness, the diversity of moss mites, the average number of species, and the Shannon general species diversity index. The use of soil mulching with the Scots pine wood chips did not significantly affect the growth and developmental characteristics of the Scots pine plants. After mulching with wood chips, the total number of mites increased many times, and moss mites began to dominate among micro-arthropods. Mulching treatments increased the number and the species diversity of moss mites in the substrate. The number of moss mites increased the most in wood chips without additives. The highest species diversity was observed in the wood chips with the addition of forest litter. Among moss mites Tectocepheus velatus visibly dominated in all study treatments. Oppiella nova and Scutovertex sculptus also constituted numerous mites populations. The study shows that the wood chips are very useful for use in the regeneration of the devastated and degraded forest soils. {\textcopyright} Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of The Environment Protection.

abstract = {Fertilization experiments in tropical forests have shown that litterfall increases in response to the addition of one or more soil nutrients. However, the relationship between soil nutrient availability and litterfall is poorly defined along natural soil fertility gradients, especially in tropical montane forests. Here, we measured litterfall for two years in five lower montane 1-ha plots spanning a soil fertility and precipitation gradient in lower montane forest at Fortuna, Panama. Litterfall was also measured in a concurrent nitrogen fertilization experiment at one site. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to test for site (or treatment), year, and season effects on vegetative, reproductive and total litterfall. We predicted that total litterfall, and the ratio of reproductive to leaf litterfall, would increase with nutrient availability along the fertility gradient, and in response to nitrogen addition. We found that total annual litterfall varied substantially among 1-ha plots (4.78 Mg/ha/yr to 7.96 Mg/ha/yr), and all but the most aseasonal plot showed significant seasonality in litterfall. However, litterfall accumulation did not track soil nutrient availability; instead forest growing on relatively infertile soil, but dominated by an ectomycorrhizal tree species, had the highest total litterfall accumulation. In the fertilization plots, significantly more total litter fell in nitrogen addition relative to control plots, but this increase in response to nitrogen (13%) was small compared to variation observed among 1-ha plots. These results suggest that while litterfall at Fortuna is nutrient-limited, compositional and functional turnover along the fertility gradient obscure any direct relationship between soil resource availability and canopy productivity. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) limits plant growth in many forest ecosystems. The largest N pool in the plant-soil system is typically organic, contained primarily within the living plants and in the humus and litter layers of the soil. Understanding the pathways by which plants obtain N is a priority for clarifying N cycling processes in forest ecosystems. In this review, the interactions between saprotrophic microorganisms and ectomycorrhizal fungi in N nutrition with a focus on the ability of ectomycorrhizal fungi to circumvent N mineralization for the nutrition of plants in forest ecosystems will be discussed. Traditionally, it is believed that in order for plants to fulfill their N requirements, they primarily utilize ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). In temperate forest ecosystems, many woody plants form ectomycorrhizas which significantly improves phosphorus (P) and N acquisition by plants. Under laboratory conditions, ectomycorrhizal fungi have also been proven to be able to obtain N from organic sources such as protein. It was thus proposed that ectomycorrhizal fungi potentially circumvent the standard N cycle involving N mineralization by saprotrophic microorganisms. However, in many forest ecosystems the majority of the proteins in the forest floor form complexes with polyphenols. Direct access of N by ectomycorrhizal fungi from a polyphenol-protein complex may be limited. Ectomycorrhizal fungi may depend on saprotrophic microorganisms to liberate organic N sources from polyphenol complexes. Thus, interactions between saprotrophic microorganisms and ectomycorrhizal fungi are likely to be essential in the cycling of N within temperate forest ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Information on pathways and rates of decomposition of coarse woody debris (CWD) from one of the dominant boreal tree species – Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) – is scarce. We examined presence and distribution of internal decay in its living trees and decomposition rates in an 88-year chronosequence of logs in an old-growth mesic mixed European boreal forest. Fifty-two percent of the trees started decaying prior to death. Butt or stem rot was caused by white- and brown-rot biotrophic fungi in almost equal proportions. Those trees lost on average 29% of their initial wood mass. The mean decomposition rate of wood as related to initial conditions was 0.007 yr −1 for wood with initial biotrophic decay and 0.010 yr −1 for wood with saprotrophic decay. Bark lost its mass and volume faster – at a rate of 0.056 yr −1 . The rate of carbon (C) loss for the whole stem was 0.024 yr −1 in wood affected by saprotrophic fungi and 0.007 yr −1 when the tree was affected by biotrophic fungi. When calculating C losses due to decomposition, separating bark and wood with different C concentrations and decomposition patterns as well as the rate of biotrophic and saprotrophic decay enables us to refine estimates of the role of Siberian larch CWD in C cycling. Further research is still needed to resolve uncertainties around the role of fungal communities and the origins and decomposition rates of butt rots and stem rots in living trees of Siberian larch, as well as the distribution patterns of these fungi and decomposition processes in individual trees and at the ecosystem level. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We explored the most influential stand-scaled drivers of ectomycorrhizal, terricolous saprotrophic, and wood-inhabiting (main functional groups) macrofungal species richness in mixed forests by applying regression models. We tested 67 potential explanatory variables representing tree species composition, stand structure, soil and litter conditions, microclimate, landscape structure, and management history. Within the main functional groups, we formed and modeled guilds and used their drivers to more objectively interpret the drivers of the main functional groups. Terricolous saprotrophic fungi were supported by air humidity and litter mass. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were suppressed by high soil nitrogen content and high air temperature. Wood saprotrophs were enhanced by litter pH (deciduous habitats), deadwood cover, and beech proportion. Wood saprotrophic guilds were determined often by drivers with hidden effects on all wood saprotrophs: non-parasites: total deadwood cover; parasites: beech proportion; white rotters: litter pH; brown rotters: air temperature (negatively); endophytes: beech proportion; early ruderals: deciduous stands that were formerly meadows; combative invaders: deciduous tree taxa; heart rotters: coarse woody debris; late stage specialists: deciduous deadwood. Terricolous saprotrophic cord formers positively responded to litter mass. Studying the drivers of guilds simultaneously, beech was a keystone species to maintain fungal diversity in the region, and coniferous stands would be more diverse by introducing deciduous tree species. Guilds were determined by drivers different from each other underlining their different functional roles and segregated substrate preferences. Modeling guilds of fungal species with concordant response to the environment would be powerful to explore and understand the functioning of fungal communities. {\textcopyright} 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract = {We compared the understory herb and shrub communities of pre-commercially thinned and unthinned young- and old-growth Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands. Sites were located in the Cascade Mountains of western Oregon. Young stands were approximately 40 years old at the time of sampling; thinning occurred 20 years earlier. Although tree spacing was wider in thinned than in unthinned stands, faster tree growth in thinned stands meant that thinning had no long-term effect on basal area of P. menziesii. The very large, widely spaced P. menziesii individuals in old-growth stands contributed similar basal area as the smaller trees in young stands; however, old stands had much higher basal area of shade-tolerant conifers. Although low shrubs responded positively to thinning, the difference in cover between thinned and unthinned stands was too small to be statistically significant. Ordination of sample plots in terms of their understory shrub and herb species composition identified a strong gradient in community composition from young to old-growth stands. Understory species associated with old growth included both gap specialists and those that may be dependent on the litter depth and mycorrhizal fungi of old-growth forest floors. Although both thinned and unthinned young stand composition were quite distinct from that of old-growth stands, thinned stands were more similar to old growth than were unthinned stands. Thinned stands had higher frequency of late-seral herbs than did unthinned stands. Forest generalist and release species showed mixed responses to thinning. We conclude that pre-commercial thinning may be a useful management tool to encourage old growth associated understory herbs without precipitating dominance of the understory by low shrubs and weedy species. Although thinning did accelerate tree growth, changes in the understory appear to have been precipitated by the transient increase in resource levels following thinning rather than by any long-term changes in stand structure. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {There is evidence that anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition enhances carbon (C) sequestration in boreal forest soils. However, it is unclear how free-living saprotrophs (bacteria and fungi, SAP) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi responses to N addition impact soil C dynamics. Our aim was to investigate how SAP and EM communities are impacted by N enrichment and to estimate whether these changes influence decay of litter and humus. We conducted a long-term experiment in northern Sweden, maintained since 2004, consisting of ambient, low N additions (0, 3, 6, and 12 kg N ha−1 year−1) simulating current N deposition rates in the boreal region, as well as a high N addition (50 kg N ha−1 year−1). Our data showed that long-term N enrichment impeded mass loss of litter, but not of humus, and only in response to the highest N addition treatment. Furthermore, our data showed that EM fungi reduced the mass of N and P in both substrates during the incubation period compared to when only SAP organisms were present. Low N additions had no effect on microbial community structure, while the high N addition decreased fungal and bacterial biomasses and altered EM fungi and SAP community composition. Actinomycetes were the only bacterial SAP to show increased biomass in response to the highest N addition. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of how anthropogenic N enrichment can influence soil C accumulation rates and suggest that current N deposition rates in the boreal region (≤12 kg N ha−1 year−1) are likely to have a minor impact on the soil microbial community and the decomposition of humus and litter. {\textcopyright} 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Fungi regulate key nutrient cycling processes in many forest ecosystems, but their diversity and distribution within and across ecosystems are poorly understood. Here, we examine the spatial distribution of fungi across a boreal and tropical ecosystem, focusing on ectomycorrhizal fungi. We analyzed fungal community composition across litter (organic horizons) and underlying soil horizons (0-20 cm) using 454 pyrosequencing and clone library sequencing. In both forests, we found significant clustering of fungal communities by site and soil horizons with analogous patterns detected by both sequencing technologies. Free-living saprotrophic fungi dominated the recently-shed leaf litter and ectomycorrhizal fungi dominated the underlying soil horizons. This vertical pattern of fungal segregation has also been found in temperate and European boreal forests, suggesting that these results apply broadly to ectomycorrhizal-dominated systems, including tropical rain forests. Since ectomycorrhizal and free-living saprotrophic fungi have different influences on soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics, information on the spatial distribution of these functional groups will improve our understanding of forest nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2013 McGuire et al.},

abstract = {Land management practices considerably influence ecosystem processes and functioning, particularly in dryland ecosystems where nutrient and water limitations have direct (via effects on productivity) and indirect (via effects on soil biota) effects on ecosystem properties. Fungi in soils and associated with roots play critical roles in soil nutrient cycling and plant nutrient acquisition, but their responses to land management practices in dryland ecosystems remain equivocal. Here we evaluate the responses of fungal communities in roots and soils associated with a Eucalyptus saligna plantation after six years of forest management practices (irrigation and fertilisation) and in two different microenvironments within treated plots, in the presence and absence of understorey grasses. We observed that the richness and evenness of fungal communities were higher in soil than in root samples, but these two parameters did not vary among any of the management treatments. Effects of fertilisation and irrigation on fungal community composition were observed and appeared to be related to variation in soil pH, moisture, and nitrogen availability. Both fertilisation and irrigation decreased the ratios of ectomycorrhizal fungi to total fungi and increased the frequencies of saprotrophic and/or plant pathogenic fungi. We observed that some OTUs were shared between soil and root-associated fungal communities but that fertilisation was associated with lower frequencies of shared OTUs, suggesting a decoupling of these communities. In the absence of grasses, where only tree roots were present, we observed fewer tight relationships between fungal occurrence in root and soil samples. Our findings highlight the importance of forest management practices for fungal community assembly processes in dryland ecosystems, which may have consequences for the predictability of fungal community dynamics and nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2017},

abstract = {Evergreen and deciduous plants are widely expected to have different impacts on soil nitrogen (N) availability because of differences in leaf litter chemistry and ensuing effects on net N mineralization ( min). We evaluated this hypothesis by compiling published data on net min rates beneath co-occurring stands of evergreen and deciduous trees. The compiled data included 35 sets of co-occurring stands in temperate and boreal forests. Evergreen and deciduous stands did not have consistently divergent effects on net min rates; net min beneath deciduous trees was higher when comparing natural stands (19 contrasts), but equivalent to evergreens in plantations (16 contrasts). We also compared net min rates beneath pairs of co-occurring genera. Most pairs of genera did not differ consistently, i.e., tree species from one genus had higher net min at some sites and lower net min at other sites. Moreover, several common deciduous genera (Acer, Betula, Populus) and deciduous Quercus spp. did not typically have higher net min rates than common evergreen genera (Pinus, Picea). There are several reasons why tree effects on net min are poorly predicted by leaf habit and phylogeny. For example, the amount of N mineralized from decomposing leaves might be less than the amount of N mineralized from organic matter pools that are less affected by leaf litter traits, such as dead roots and soil organic matter. Also, effects of plant traits and plant groups on net min probably depend on site-specific factors such as stand age and soil type. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Limitations in available techniques to separate autotrophic (root) and soil heterotrophic respiration have hampered the understanding of forest C cycling. The former is here defined as respiration by roots, their associated mycorrhizal fungi and other micro-organisms in the rhizosphere directly dependent on labile C compounds leaked from roots. In order to separate the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of soil respiration, all Scots pine trees in 900 m2 plots were girdled to instantaneously terminate the supply of current photosynthates from the tree canopy to roots. H{\"{o}}gberg et al. (Nature 411, 789-792, 2001) reported that autotrophic activity contributed up to 56% of total soil respiration during the first summer of this experiment. They also found that mobilization of stored starch (and likely also sugars) in roots after girdling caused an increased apparent heterotrophic respiration on girdled plots. Herein a transient increase in the $\delta$13C of soil CO2 efflux after girdling, thought to be due to decomposition of 13C-enriched ectomycorrhizal mycelium and root starch and sugar reserves, is reported. In the second year after girdling, when starch reserves of girdled tree roots were exhausted, calculated root respiration increased up to 65% of total soil CO2 efflux. It is suggested that this estimate of its contribution to soil respiration is more precise than the previous based on one year of observation. Heterotrophic respiration declined in response to a 20-day-long 6°C decline in soil temperature during the second summer, whereas root respiration did not decline. This did not support the idea that root respiration should be more sensitive to variations in soil temperature. It is suggested that above-ground photosynthetic activity and allocation patterns of recent photosynthates to roots should be considered in models of responses of forest C balances to global climate change.},

Despite the crucial ecological role of soil fungi in grasslands, knowledge about fungal community diversity and structure in Mediterranean meadow habitats is still fragmentary. We analyzed macrofungal communities in three geographically distinct Mediterranean montane calcareous grasslands and surrounding forests, by means of fruit body surveys. We investigated a number of biotic and abiotic factors influencing the studied fungal communities, including plant species composition. Out of 6365 fruit bodies, a total of 268 species belonging to 84 genera were found. In general, there was a significant correlation between plant species richness and fungal richness. Variation in vegetation and plant community structure accounted for approximately 20% of variance in fungal community structure. Tree and shrub vegetation played a dominant role in shaping the analyzed fungal communities, both in meadows and surrounding forests, with particular influence on ectomycorrhizal, litter, and lignicolous saprotrophic fungi. Fungal biodiversity in the studied meadows was increased by the presence of tree and shrub species from the adjacent forests, but was reduced by the increasing vegetation cover. {\textcopyright} 2020 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences},

abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis has been proposed to link plant photosynthesis and soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition through the production of fungal enzymes which promote SOM degradation and nitrogen (N) uptake. However, laboratory and field evidence for the existence of these processes are rare. Piloderma sp., a common ECM genus in boreal forest soil, was chosen as model mycorrhiza for this study. The abundance of Piloderma sp. was studied in root tips and soil over one growing season and in winter. Protease production was measured from ectomycorrhiza and soil solution in the field and pure fungal cultures. We also tested the effect of Piloderma olivaceum on host plant organic N nutrition in the laboratory. The results showed that Piloderma sp. was highly abundant in the field and produced extracellular proteases, which correlated positively with the gross primary production, temperature and soil respiration. In the laboratory, Piloderma olivaceum could improve the ability of Pinus sylvestris L. to utilize N from extragenous proteins. We suggest that ECM fungi, although potentially retaining N in their hyphae, are important in forest C and N cycling due to their ability to access proteinaeous N. As Piloderma sp. abundance appeared to be seasonally highly variable, recycling of fungal-bound N after hyphal death may therefore be of primary importance for the N cycling in boreal ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2015 Heinonsalo et al.

abstract = {An essential carbon (C) pool of forest ecosystems is stored in belowground tree biomass; however, data about belowground C and nutrient accumulation is scarce. It is crucial to involve belowground part for developing regional and global C or nitrogen (N) budgets for different forest ecosystems.Fine root (D 2.0. mm) biomass and spatial allocation as well as coarse root (D≥ 2.0. mm) biomass were studied in a chronosequence in four silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) stands aged 6-60. years.The soil coring method was used for estimation of birch fine root biomass and necromass in the upper 40. cm topsoil layer. Stump biomass and coarse root biomass were estimated by excavation of the root systems of model trees in a 6-year-old stand and in a 32-year-old silver birch stand. For a 14-year-old stand and for a 60-year-old stand, the developed root-shoot ratio approach was used. Carbon and nitrogen accumulation in belowground biomass was estimated as well.Fine root biomass varied between 103gm-2 and 409gm-2 and fine root necromass, between 22gm-2 and 93gm-2; both increased with stand age. Fine root vertical distribution showed a gradual decrease with soil depth in all profiles, however, fine root biomass shifted more to the deeper soil layers with increasing stand age. The fine root live/dead ratio decreased hyperbolically with stand age while the change was most rapid before pole age.The most active part of the fine root system - ectomycorrhizal biomass (EcMB) - was estimated for three stands (6-, 14- and 32-year-old); EcMB per basal area varied between 8 and 14kgm-2 and was not related to stand age.Coarse root biomass increased with stand age from 7.9Mgha-1 in the 6-year-old stand to 40.2Mgha-1 in the 60-year-old stand. The root-shoot ratio decreased in silver birch stands drastically between 6 and 14years but stabilized thereafter. Hence the use of a root-shoot ratio of 21% for calculation of belowground biomass from aboveground biomass for silver birch stands is justified.Carbon accumulation in the belowground tree biomass of silver birch stands varied between 4.0Mgha-1 and 19.8Mgha-1, being the highest in the 60-year-old stand. The C accumulated in belowground biomass accounted for 3-4% of the total C storage of the total C storage of the forest ecosystem in the young stands and for 9.5-11% in the middle-aged and mature stands. Fine root mortality and the corresponding C flow as fine-root litter input increased with stand age. As the biomass of the trees was the main C sink, a significant share (3-28%) of C was accumulated in the belowground part of the stand. C accumulation in the fine roots was low in chronosequence birch stands; however the C flux into the soil through fine root litter may be considerable. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The fungal oxidoreductases involved in these processes are today the focus of much attention with a view to their applications. The ecological role and potential biotechnological applications of 300 isolates of Basidiomycetes were assessed, taking into account the degradation of model dyes in different culture conditions and the production of oxidoreductase enzymes. The tested isolates belong to different ecophysiological groups (wood-degrading, litter-degrading, ectomycorrhizal, and coprophilous fungi) and represent a broad systematic and functional biodiversity among Basidiomycetes occurring in deciduous and evergreen forests of northwest Italy (Piedmont Region). The high number of species tested and the use of different culture conditions allowed the investigation of the degradation activity of several novel species, neglected to date. Oxidative enzyme activities varied widely among all ecophysiological groups and laccases were the most commonly detected enzymes. A large number of isolates (86%), belonging to all ecophysiological groups, were found to be active against at least one model dye; the wood-degrading fungi represented the most efficient group. Noteworthily, also some isolates of litter-degrading and ectomycorrhizal fungi achieved good decolorization yield. The 25 best isolates were then tested against nine industrial dyes commonly employed in textile industries. Three isolates of Bjerkandera adusta efficiently decolorized the dyes on all media and can be considered important candidates for application in textile wastewater treatment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Global-change drivers such as changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition occur worldwide, but affect community trait distributions at the local scale, where resources (e.g. light availability) and conditions (e.g. soil pH) also influence plant communities. We investigate how multiple environmental drivers affect community trait responses related to resource acquisition (plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), woodiness, and mycorrhizal status) and regeneration (seed mass, lateral spread) of European temperate deciduous forest understoreys. We sampled understorey communities and derived trait responses across spatial gradients of global-change drivers (temperature, precipitation, nitrogen deposition, and past land use), while integrating in-situ plot measurements on resources and conditions (soil type, Olsen phosphorus (P), Ellenberg soil moisture, light, litter mass, and litter quality). Among the global-change drivers, mean annual temperature strongly influenced traits related to resource acquisition. Higher temperatures were associated with taller understoreys producing leaves with lower SLA, and a higher proportional cover of woody and obligate mycorrhizal (OM) species. Communities in plots with higher Ellenberg soil moisture content had smaller seeds and lower proportional cover of woody and OM species. Finally, plots with thicker litter layers hosted taller understoreys with larger seeds and a higher proportional cover of OM species. Our findings suggest potential community shifts in temperate forest understoreys with global warming, and highlight the importance of local resources and conditions as well as global-change drivers for community trait variation. {\textcopyright} 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands},

abstract = {Ecosystems with ectomycorrhizal plants have high soil carbon : nitrogen ratios, but it is not clear why. The Gadgil effect, where competition between ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi for nitrogen slows litter decomposition, may increase soil carbon. However, experimental evidence for the Gadgil effect is equivocal. Here, we apply resource-ratio theory to assess whether interguild fungal competition for different forms of organic nitrogen can affect litter decomposition. We focus on variation in resource input ratios and fungal resource use traits, and evaluate our model's predictions by synthesizing prior experimental literature examining ectomycorrhizal effects on litter decomposition. In our model, resource input ratios determined whether ectomycorrhizal fungi suppressed saprotrophic fungi. Recalcitrant litter inputs favored the former over the latter, allowing the Gadgil effect only when such inputs predominated. Although ectomycorrhizal fungi did not always hamper litter decomposition, ectomycorrhizal nitrogen uptake always increased carbon : nitrogen ratios in litter. Our meta-analysis of empirical studies supports our theoretical results: ectomycorrhizal fungi appear to slow decomposition of leaf litter only in forests where litter inputs are highly recalcitrant. We thus find that the specific contribution of the Gadgil effect to high soil carbon : nitrogen ratios in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems may be smaller than predicted previously. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

abstract = {1. Mycorrhizae form a critical link between above-ground plants and the soil system by influencing plant nutrition, nutrient cycling and soil structure. Understanding how mycorrhizae respond to disturbances may lead to important advances in interpreting above-ground plant recovery. 2. The inoculum potential for arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi was investigated in thinned-only, thinned and prescribed burned (both restoration treatments) and unthinned and unburned control stands in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. The relationships between mycorrhizal fungal propagule densities and plant community and soil properties were quantified. 3. The relative amount of infective propagules of AM fungi was significantly higher in samples collected from both restoration treatments than their paired controls (unthinned and unburned stands). In contrast, the same restoration treatments had no significant effect on the relative amount of infective propagules of EM fungi. 4. The relative amount of infective propagules of AM fungi was significantly positively correlated with graminoid cover and herbaceous understorey species richness and negatively correlated with overstorey tree canopy cover and litter cover. 5. Synthesis and applications. These results indicate that population densities of AM fungi can rapidly increase following restoration treatments in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. This has important implications for restoring the herbaceous understorey of these forests because most understorey plants depend on AM associations for normal growth. These results also can be applied to other ecosystems that are in a state of restoration or where the role of fire is just beginning to be understood.},

Macrofungi were surveyed on these plots at weekly intervals during the fruiting season over 3 years. During this survey 177 species were recorded, including 30 species inhabiting leaf litter, 36 ectomycorrhizal species, 29 non-mycorrhizal soil-inhabiting species, and 79 wood-inhabiting species. This species richness is comparable to, but slightly higher than, that reported by other plot-based studies undertaken in hardwood forests. We compared the ability of seven species-richness estimation techniques to 'determine the true species richness on these plots. While some estimators performed better than others, in general the estimations were too low based on the following year's data and were not consistent from year to year. We found some evidence of spatial autocorrelation of communities of fungi found in adjacent subplots. This indicates that the benefit of using contiguous subplots to increase the homogeneity of the area sampled needs to be balanced against the possibility of underestimating the species richness of an area because of spatial autocorrelation.},

abstract = {Research Highlights: Moderate thinning can effectively improve forestry production and change the microenvironment of understory vegetation. Background and Objectives: Microbial communities control the decomposition and transformation of forest organic matter; however, the influence of thinning on microbes in the organic horizon remains unclear. Materials and Methods: In this study, we subjected four plots of Chinese pine plantations in Badaling, Beijing to different thinning intensities, including no thinning (T0), low-intensity thinning (T10), medium-intensity thinning (T20), and high-intensity thinning (T50). The changes in chemical properties and microbial community compositions observed in the organic horizon, which comprised undecomposed litter (L layer) and half-decomposed litter (F layer), were analyzed after thinning. Microbial community compositions were evaluated using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) methods. Results: The results showed that the abundances of gram-negative bacteria (GN) and total bacteria (B) under the T10 thinning condition were the highest among the four thinning intensities, and the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in T20 was higher than under other thinning intensities. The abundance of gram-positive bacteria (GP) and actinobacteria (ACT) in T10 was lower than in both T0 and T50. The abundance of total PLFAs and fungi (FU) was higher in the L layer, whereas the abundance of GP, GN, B, ACT, and AMF was higher in the F layer. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the L layer better reflects the influence of thinning on litter. Redundancy analysis (RDA) results indicated that the organic carbon (LOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and ammonium nitrogen (NH4 +-N)contents of litter were primarily responsible for the observed changes in microbial community structure, with LOC alone explaining 62.6% of the total variance among the litter substrate factors selected. Overall, moderate-intensity thinning of Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. plantations created more favorable conditions for microbial communities in the organic horizon. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.

abstract = {Suites of fungal adaptation to nutrient acquisition and allocation of vegetations are observed along forest succession gradients. However, the mechanisms behind seral shifts in plant-associated fungi need to be uncovered. To bridge this knowledge gap, the current study investigated the litter and soil chemical variables as well as the fungal community using high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing along a 30a-100a succession gradient of a subtropical forest ecosystem in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. Litter nitrogen (N) content changed consistently with fungal alpha-diversity and the relative abundances of functional guilds, such as saprotrophs and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, this trend was opposite to that observed for ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi and litter carbon (C) content. The total and water-soluble C and N contents as well as the C/N ratios in soil decreased with stand age, while the relative abundances of Rozellomycota, Chytridiomycota and lichens as well as the microbial C and N use efficiencies exhibited increasing trends across succession stages. Multivariate analysis and multiple linear regression showed that the seral shifts in fungal diversity and composition were closely related to the C:N stoichiometry of soil and litter. Specifically, the litter C content either negatively explained the alpha-diversity and saprotroph abundance or positively explained the abundance of EcM fungi. In contrast, the litter N content presented opposite trends. Further, the variances in the abundances of Rozellomycota and AM fungi were negatively explained by water-soluble C content but positively explained by water-soluble N content in the soil. These findings confirm that the replenishment and reduction of available nutrients are determined by plant-fungus interactions via the C:N stoichiometry of litter and soil along the forest chronosequence. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Trees allocate a large portion of gross primary production belowground for the production and maintenance of roots and mycorrhizae. The difficulty of directly measuring total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA) has limited our understanding of belowground carbon (C) cycling and the factors that control this important flux. We measured TBCA over 4 years using a conservation of mass, C balance approach in replicate stands of fast growing Eucalyptus saligna Smith with different nutrition management and tree density treatments. We measured TBCA as surface carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux ("soil" respiration) minus C inputs from aboveground litter plus the change in C stored in roots, litter, and soil. We evaluated this C balance approach to measuring TBCA by examining (a) the variance in TBCA across replicate plots; (b) cumulative error associated with summing components to arrive at our estimates of TBCA; (c) potential sources of error in the techniques and assumptions; (d) the magnitude of changes in C stored in soil, litter, and roots compared to TBCA; and (e) the sensitivity of our measures of TBCA to differences in nutrient availability, tree density, and forest age. The C balance method gave precise estimates of TBCA and reflected differences in belowground allocation expected with manipulations of fertility and tree density. Across treatments, TBCA averaged 1.88 kg C m-2 y-1 and was 18% higher in plots planted with 104 trees/ha compared to plots planted with 1111 trees/ha. TBCA was 12% lower (but not significantly so) in fertilized plots. For all treatments, TBCA declined linearly with stand age. The coefficient of variation (CV) for TBCA for replicate plots averaged 17%. Averaged across treatments and years, annual changes in C stored in soil, the litter layer, and coarse roots (-0.01, 0.06, and 0.21 kg C m-2 y-1, respectively) were small compared with surface CO2 efflux (2.03 kg C m-2 y-1), aboveground litterfall (0.42 kg C m-2 y-1), and our estimated TBCA (1.88 kg C m-2 y-1. Based on studies from similar sites, estimates of losses of C through leaching, erosion, or storage of C in deep soil were less than 1% of annual TBCA.},

Little is known about the importance of FWD and litter to fungal diversity, although they constitute the major components of dead organic matter in both managed and natural forests. We investigated the long-term effects of removing logging residue on the saprotrophic fungi community in the litter layer by using an experiment established 25 years ago, comprising stands with and without removal of clear-cut slash. The fungal communities were identified using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism from standardized baits of wood and needles left in the litter layer for 30 months. A total of 74 fungal taxa were recorded. No differences in species richness or frequency of abundant species were detected between the stands with and without slash removal, suggesting that the extraction of logging residues has a negligible long-term impact on abundant saprotrophic fungi. Twenty-five of the 36 abundant species colonized wood and needles indiscriminately, while 10 species occurred exclusively on wood or needles and only one species mainly on wood. The importance of litter to certain wood-inhabiting fungi may therefore be underrated. The frequent records of Trichaptum abietinum (Dicks.) Ryvarden indicate that woodinhabiting species may, surprisingly, be found in the litter layer.},

Diversity of basidiomycete laccase genes was assessed in a cambisolic forest soil, and the spatial distribution of the sequences was mapped in a 100-m2 plot by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on soil DNA extracts. Diversity of laccase sequences was higher in the organic horizon and decreased with the depth.

Most dominant sequences were attributed to the extramatrical hyphae of known ectomycorrhizal taxa (e.g., Russulaceae) and restricted to small patches (<0.77 m2) in a specific soil horizon. Soil fungi with laccase genes occupied different niches and showed strikingly variable distribution patterns.

abstract = {Although most plant products eventually enter the below-ground subsystem as plant litter, relatively little is known about the effects of plant litter diversity or composition on ecosystem processes and no study has considered the responses of plant growth to these factors. We conducted an experiment in which humus substrate was collected from three field sites in the boreal forest of northern Sweden. Litter was then placed on the humus surface, and the litter used consisted of monocultures of Empetrum hermaphroditum (dwarf shrub), Betula pendula (tree), and Pleurozium schreberi (feather moss), as well as mixtures containing all the possible (two-way and three-way) combinations of these species; the experiment was maintained in out-door conditions. Although decomposition rates of this surface-placed litter differed between species few effects of litter mixing on litter mass loss were apparent. Added litter of Pinus sylvestris litter broke down most slowly when placed in E. hermaphroditum litter but sometimes showed elevated decomposition rates when placed in some of the multiple species litter mixes. Soil microbial biomass and activity was lowest when plant litter was absent, but as long as plant litter was present on the humus surface the species composition and diversity of the litter was irrelevant. There were few effects of litter treatments on growth of seedlings of either B. pendula or P. sylvestris planted into the humus. However, for one site there were significant effects of mixing litter of P. schreberi and E. hermaphroditum in reducing growth of both seedling species. Litter treatments generally did not alter the competitive balance between B. pendula and P. sylvestris seedlings when grown together but for all sites litter treatments had significant effects on the overall intensity of competition, and mixing of litter of B. pendula and P. schreberi had significant non-additive effects on competition intensity for two of the three sites. The abundance of mycorrhizae on seedlings was only weakly related to litter treatment but there were some positive effects of litter mixing on one of the most abundant mycorrhizal morphotypes on both species of seedlings for one of the sites. Our results suggest that litter presence was important in influencing a range of above ground and below ground properties and processes. In some instances individual species effects and litter mixing effects were also important but few general patterns emerged, and the nature of significant effects tended to be idiosyncratic. Ultimately our results show that plant litter has important 'afterlife effects' which need to be considered in order to develop a more complete understanding of how biodiversity affects ecosystems.},

abstract = {Focusing on Sumatra, a hotspot of tropical lowland rainforest transformation, we investigated effects of the conversion of rainforests into rubber agroforests (“jungle rubber”), intensive rubber, and oil palm plantations on the communities of litter and soil microorganisms and identified factors responsible for these changes. Litter basal respiration, microbial biomass, total bacterial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and fungal PLFAs did not vary significantly with rainforest conversion. In litter of converted ecosystems, the concentration of certain PLFAs including the Gram-negative bacteria marker PLFA cy17:0 and the Gram-positive bacteria marker PLFA i17:0 was reduced as compared to rainforest, whereas the concentration of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) marker neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA) 16:1$\omega$5c increased. As indicated by redundancy analysis, litter pH and carbon concentration explained most of the variation in litter microbial community composition. In soil, microbial biomass did not vary significantly with rainforest conversion, whereas basal respiration declined. Total PLFAs and especially that of Gram-negative bacteria decreased, whereas PLFA i17:0 increased with rainforest conversion. The concentration of fungal PLFAs increased with rainforest conversion, whereas NLFA 16:1$\omega$5c did not change significantly. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil pH explained most of the variation in soil microbial community composition. Overall, the data suggest that conversion of rainforests into production systems results in more pronounced changes in microbial community composition in soil as compared to litter. In particular, the response of fungi and bacteria was more pronounced in soil, while the response of AMF was more pronounced in litter. Notably, only certain bacterial markers but not those of saprotrophic fungi and AMF were detrimentally affected by rainforest conversion. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Age of the genets was estimated at 13 to 26 and 16 to 31 years, for the two sites. The smallest genet was represented by two sporocarps suggesting recent colonization by spores. {\textcopyright} 1994, British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Early establishment of white spruce (Picea glauca) in mixedwood boreal forest stands following fire was examined at several times-since-fire (1-, 2-, 4-, 6-, 14-years). Abiotic and biotic conditions in the stands were assessed at two scales, tree plot (5 m × 5 m) and microsite (1 m × 1 m), along with presence, density and height of white spruce seedlings. Germination and survival of seed sown 1- and 4-years post fire were quantified. Survival and growth of nursery-grown seedlings, and mycorrhizal colonization, survival and growth of sterile seedlings, planted 1-year post-fire were assessed. At the tree plot scale, presence of white spruce seedlings 1-year post-fire could be reliably predicted by organic layer depth and distance to and strength of seed source. In contrast, none of the biotic or abiotic factors measured was strongly correlated with occurrence or density of white spruce seedlings 6- and 14- years post-fire. At the microsite scale, seedling recruitment immediately post-fire was limited to a distinct subset of available microsites (greater % cover of downed wood and moss, lower % cover of litter and herbaceous vegetation). Likewise, seedling occurrence in older burns was associated with distinct microsite conditions; although this was more likely an effect of white spruce presence, rather than the cause. Less than 3% of seed sown 1 yr post-fire survived to become 1 yr old germinants, survival was 41% over the next three years. Availability of suitable regeneration microsites declines rapidly with time-since-fire; less than 0.3% of seed sown 4 yrs post-fire survived one year. High rates of mycorrhizal colonization were found on white spruce seedlings planted 1-year post-fire, including early and late stage fungal species. Microsite characteristics were only weakly correlated with mycorrhizal fungal communities. We propose that immediate post-fire recruitment of white spruce is a key process in mixedwood boreal succession.},

abstract = {Aims: Our aims were to characterize the fate of leaf-litter-derived nitrogen in the plant-soil-microbe system of a temperate beech forest of Southern Germany and to identify its importance for N nutrition of beech seedlings. Methods: 15N-labelled leaf litter was traced in situ into abiotic and biotic N pools in mineral soil as well as into beech seedlings and mycorrhizal root tips over three growing seasons. Results: There was a rapid transfer of 15N into the mineral soil already 21 days after tracer application with soil microbial biomass initially representing the dominant litter-N sink. However, 15N recovery in non-extractable soil N pools strongly increased over time and subsequently became the dominant 15N sink. Recovery in plant biomass accounted for only 0.025 % of 15N excess after 876 days. After three growing seasons, 15N excess recovery was characterized by the following sequence: non-extractable soil N >> extractable soil N including microbial biomass >> plant biomass > ectomycorrhizal root tips. Conclusions: After quick vertical dislocation and cycling through microbial N pools, there was a rapid stabilization of leaf-litter-derived N in non-extractable N pools of the mineral soil. Very low 15N recovery in beech seedlings suggests a high importance of other N sources such as root litter for N nutrition of beech understorey. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that dinitrogen (N2)- and non-N2-fixing tropical trees would have distinct phosphorus (P) acquisition strategies allowing them to exploit different P sources, reducing competition. We measured root phosphatase activity and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization among two N2- and two non-N2-fixing seedlings, and grew them alone and in competition with different inorganic and organic P forms to assess potential P partitioning. We found an inverse relationship between root phosphatase activity and AM colonization in field-collected seedlings, indicative of a trade-off in P acquisition strategies. This correlated with the predominantly exploited P sources in the seedling experiment: the N2 fixer with high N2 fixation and root phosphatase activity grew best on organic P, whereas the poor N2 fixer and the two non-N2 fixers with high AM colonization grew best on inorganic P. When grown in competition, however, AM colonization, root phosphatase activity and N2 fixation increased in the N2 fixers, allowing them to outcompete the non-N2 fixers regardless of P source. Our results indicate that some tropical trees have the capacity to partition soil P, but this does not eliminate interspecific competition. Rather, enhanced P and N acquisition strategies may increase the competitive ability of N2 fixers relative to non-N2 fixers. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

All strains were able to decompose 14C-labelled plant lignin, 14C-lignocellulose and 14C-DHP-lignin at a rate which was lower than the one observed for the known white rot fungi Heterobasidion annosum and Sporotrichum pulverulentum. Also 14C-(U)-holocellulose was relatively less degradable for the mycorrhizal fungi than for the white rotters. On the other hand, aromatic monomers like 14C-vanillic acid were decomposed to a much higher extent by two species of mycorrhizal fungi compared to the activity observed for Heterobasidion annosum.

abstract = {Understanding factors that regulate ecosystem responses to disturbances is a long-standing ecological goal and has been useful in predicting the effects of global change. The response of an ecosystem to a single perturbation does not necessarily predict its response to repeated perturbations—highlighting the ‘pulse' vs. ‘press' framework to predict ecosystem responses to single or recurring perturbations, respectively. This framework can help guide hypotheses around how ecosystems may, or may not, respond to changes in disturbance regimes. Here we apply the pulse-press framework to understand fire effects on soils and plant communities. Specifically, we combine a quantitative meta-analysis on the response of soil carbon and nutrients with a literature review of the response of microbial and plant communities. We argue that fire is a cumulative disturbance driving a ‘press' response and can be both coupled and decoupled from the ‘pulse' response to a single burn depending on whether the response variable is regulated by the direct effects of heating or the indirect effects of changing plant and microbial communities. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that carbon and nutrient content in mineral soils responded differently because carbon and nitrogen, which are volatilized to the atmosphere in a fire and turn over relatively slowly in soil, are regulated by the long-term losses of plant biomass inputs more so than heating-induced volatilization, and thus change relatively little in a single fire. Contrastingly, the elements calcium, potassium, and phosphorus, which are enriched in ash because of their resistance to volatilization, are regulated by the intermittent pulses into the soil following a fire. A literature review suggests microbial biomass and decomposition activity tended to decline after a single fire because of heat-induced mortality, which was consistent with the effects of repeated burning, likely due to combined effects of repeated heat-induced mortality and lower soil organic matter. Another important ‘press' response was how nutrient losses shape the nutrient use strategies of plants (tissue stoichiometry and nutrient acquisition strategy) and how changes in plant strategies influence soil responses. Past studies have generally found that species with low nutrient concentrations in biomass, high nutrient recycling before tissue senescence, and a greater reliance on mycorrhizal symbioses tend to increase in abundance with frequent burning. Many of these traits likely lead to slower decomposition and nutrient availability, but few studies have rigorously linked fire-driven shifts in traits with carbon and nitrogen cycling. The processes we have identified are likely to be especially important in tropical ecosystems, where disturbance by fire is shifting rapidly, attributable to changes in land use and climate. Tropical savannas are some of the most responsive landscapes to altered fire regimes, with large changes in soil carbon and nutrients, suggesting that shifts in fire regimes may change the carbon balance of these ecosystems substantially. We propose that more fire-manipulation experiments are needed in tropical forests, especially in moist forests where plants are not as well adapted to fire. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Nutrient conservation in vegetation affects rates of litter decomposition and soil nutrient availability. Although resorption has been traditionally considered one of the most important plant strategies to conserve nutrients in temperate forests, long leaf life-span and low nutrient requirements have been postulated as better indicators. We aimed at identifying nutrient conservation strategies within characteristic functional groups of NW Patagonian forests on Andisols. We analysed C-, N-, P-, K- and lignin-concentrations in mature and senescent leaves of ten native woody species within the functional groups: broad-leaved deciduous species, broad-leaved evergreens and conifers. We also examined mycorrhizal associations in all species. Nutrient concentration in mature leaves and N- resorption were higher in broad-leaved deciduous species than in the other two functional groups. Conifers had low mature leaf nutrient concentrations, low N-resorption and high lignin/N ratios in senescent leaves. P- and K-resorptions did not differ among functional groups. Broad-leaved evergreens exhibited a species-dependent response. Nitrogen in mature leaves was positively correlated with both N resorption and soil N-fertility. Despite the high P-retention capacity of Andisols, N appeared to be the more limiting nutrient, with most species being proficient in resorbing N but not P. The presence of endomycorrhizae in all conifers and the broad-leaved evergreen Maytenus boaria, ectomycorrhizae in all Nothofagus species (four deciduous, one evergreen), and cluster roots in the broad-leaved evergreen Lomatia hirsuta, would be possibly explaining why P is less limiting than N in these forests.},

abstract = {Background. Fungal endophytes inhabit symptomless, living tissues of all
major plant lineages to form one of earth's most prevalent groups of
symbionts. Many reproduce from senesced and/or decomposing leaves and
can produce extracellular leaf degrading enzymes, blurring the line
between symbiotrophy and saprotrophy. To better understand the endophyte
saprotroph continuum we compared fungal communities and functional
traits of focal strains isolated from living leaves to those isolated
from leaves after senescence and decomposition, with a focus on foliage
of woody plants in five biogeographic provinces ranging from tundra to
subtropical scrub forest.
Methods. We cultured fungi from the interior of surface-sterilized
leaves that were living at the time. of sampling (i.e., dophytes),
leaves that were dead and were retained in plant canopies (dead leaf
fungi,eDn LF), and fallen. leaves (leaf litter.fungi,LLF) from 3-4
species of woody plants in each of five sites in. North America. Our
sampling encompassed 18 plant species. representing. two families of
Pinophyta.and five families of Angiospermae. Diversity and composition
of fungal communities within and among leaf life stages, hosts, and
sites were compared using ITS-partial L SU rDNA data. We evaluated
substrate use and enzyme activity by a subset of fungi isolated'onlyfrom
living tissues vs. fungi isolated only from non-living leaves.
Results Across the diverse biomes and plant taxa surveyed here,
culturable fungi living leays were isolated less frequently and were
less diverse than those isolated from non-living leaves. Fungal
communities in living leaves also differed detectably in composition
from communities in dead leaves and leaf litter within focal sites and
host taxa, regardless of differential weighting of rare and abundant
fungi. All focal isolates grew on cellulose, lignin, and pectin as sole
carbon sources, but none displayed igninolytic or pectinolytic activity
in vitro. Cellulolytic activity differed among fungal classes. Within
Dothideomycetes, activity differed significantly between fungi from
living vs. non-living leaves, but such differences were not observed in
Sordariomycetes.
Discussion. Although some fungi with endophytic life stages clearly
persist for periods of time in leaves after senescence and incorporation
into leaf litter, our sampling across diverse biomes and host lineages
detected consistent differences between fungal assemblages in living vs.
non-living leaves, reflecting incursion by fungi from the leaf exterior
after leaf death and as leaves begin to decompose. However, fungi found
only in living leaves do not differ consistently in cellulolytic
activity from those fungi detected thus far only in dead leaves. Future
analyses should consider Basidiornycota in addition to the Ascomycota
fungi evaluated here, and should explore more dimensions of functional
traits and persistence to further define the endophytism-to-saprotrophy
continuum.},

abstract = {Extramatrical mycelia (EMM) of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are potentially extensive in soil and receive significant allocations of plant-derived carbon. Although losses from living EMM occur via respiration and exudation, EMM represents a considerable biomass component and potential carbon sink in many forest soils. ECM root tips and rhizomorphs may persist in soil for many months, but interactions between grazing arthropods and decomposers probably facilitate more rapid turnover of diffuse EMM. Elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration [CO 2] is likely to increase carbon allocation to ECM fungi by their tree hosts. This will probably increase root colonization by ECM fungi and drive changes in their communities in soil. The likely effects of elevated [CO 2] and other climate change factors on the production and turnover of EMM production are difficult to predict from current evidence, and this hampers our understanding of their potential value as future carbon sinks. Responses of grazing soil arthropods to future climate change will have a strong influence on EMM turnover, along with the abilities of ECM fungi to store carbon in below-ground, and this should be seen as a priority area for future research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The association with fine roots of woody plants forming ectomycorrhizas is a way that secures exclusive access to such a rich carbohydrate source for ectomycorrhizal fungi. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004, 2008.},

abstract = {Boreal forests harbour diverse fungal communities with decisive roles in decomposition and plant nutrition. Although changes in boreal plant communities along gradients in soil acidity and nitrogen (N) availability are well described, less is known about how fungal taxonomic and functional groups respond to soil fertility factors. We analysed fungal communities in humus and litter from 25 Swedish old-growth forests, ranging from N-rich Picea abies stands to acidic and N-poor Pinus sylvestris stands. 454-pyrosequencing of ITS2 amplicons was used to analyse community composition, and biomass was estimated by ergosterol analysis. Fungal community composition was significantly related to soil fertility at the levels of species, genera/orders and functional groups. Ascomycetes dominated in less fertile forests, whereas basidiomycetes increased in abundance in more fertile forests, both in litter and humus. The relative abundance of mycorrhizal fungi in the humus layer remained high even in the most fertile soils. Tolerance to acidity and nitrogen deficiency seems to be of greater importance than plant carbon (C) allocation patterns in determining responses of fungal communities to soil fertility, in old-growth boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 2015 New Phytologist Trust.},

Root-feeding nematodes may be pathogenic to young plants; microbial-feeding nematodes may increase turnover of the microbial pool; predacious and omnivorous nematodes represent higher trophic levels. The spatial distribution and abundance of nematode species in forests reflect soil type, soil fertility, climate, canopy and understorey plant species, litter depth, forest age, and management. Nematodes may be important in forest nurseries; they occur throughout the rooting depth of forest trees; hyphal-feeding species may influence mycorrhizae; and insect-vectored Bursaphelenchus species are a quarantine risk. Nematode populations interact with those of other soil animals (e.g., mites, tardigrades, enchytraeids, and protozoa). The diversity and abundance of the nematode assemblage make nematodes a useful indicator of soil condition and soil processes. Information available from forest systems suggests that, as long as physical disturbance is minimized and remaining trees or herb layer moderate the microclimate, logging and other forestry operations have only transitory effects on nematode populations. Extreme disturbance, such as bulldozing and slash-and-burn management, can significantly reduce nematode abundance and diversity. In contrast, management that enhances growth of understorey or herb layer can stimulate nematode populations. Each of these changes can be related to changes in food resource availability and environmental conditions, such as soil temperature and moisture. Although details of soil nematode contributions to nutrient processes in forest soils are sparse, that their populations are maintained through cycles of moderate management practices suggest that their beneficial contributions will also be maintained. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC.},

Although classical concepts assume that fungi are the main decomposers of the recalcitrant organic matter within plant and microbial biomass, whereas bacteria are considered to mostly utilize simpler compounds, recent studies have shown that fungi and bacteria overlap in substrate utilization. Here, we studied the microbial contribution to the recycling of dead biomass by analyzing the bacterial and fungal communities in soil microcosms supplemented with 13C-labeled biomass of plant, fungal, and bacterial origin using a combination of DNA-stable isotope probing and metagenomics. Both fungi and bacteria contributed actively to the degradation of complex components of plant and microbial biomass. Specific families of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme) were involved in the degradation of each biomass type. Moreover, the analysis of five bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes indicated the key role of some bacterial genera in the degradation of plant biomass (Cytophaga and Asticcacaulis) and microbial biomass (Herminiimonas). The enzymatic systems utilized by bacteria are highly complex and complementary but also highly diverse among taxa. The results confirm the importance of bacteria, in addition to fungi, as decomposers of complex organic matter in forest soils. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Cenococcum geophilum is a nearly ubiquitous and often abundant EM fungus, making the turnover dynamics of this species relevant and important across forest ecosystems. To better understand the turnover dynamics of C.geophilum ectomycorrhizas we examined their persistence using minirhizotron imaging and vitality status using a fluorescein diacetate (FDA) stain and contrasted these results with ectomycorrhizas of other EM fungi. Ectomycorrhizas formed by C. geophilum persisted 4-10 times longer and exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns of vitality compared to ectomycorrhizas of other EM fungi. Together, this suggests that litter resulting from the death of C.geophilum ectomycorrhizas is relatively recalcitrant to decay and may disproportionately influence forest biogeochemical cycles by retarding the rate at which carbon and nutrients are cycled. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Prior to the 1950s, common partial harvesting operations in the southern Appalachians USA involved the removal of logs by ground-skidding and the construction of steep access roads and skid trails along stream channels. Little is known about how these historical practices affected long-term vegetation changes. An experimental watershed in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory was partially harvested in the years 1942–1952 according to these exploitive practices. We compared the partial-cut watershed to a clear-cut watershed and an untreated, reference watershed. Using long-term vegetation surveys, we analyzed patterns in aboveground biomass accumulation, species composition and diversity (Shannon's index Hʹ and species richness) among watersheds. Contrary to our expectations, the partial-cut watershed recovered to reference levels of aboveground biomass and their species composition was similar over time. The clear-cut watershed had greater abundance of tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) than the other two watersheds. The partial-cut watershed increased in diversity over time, but it remained less diverse than the reference watershed; whereas, the clear-cut watershed had lower diversity than the other two watersheds, and its diversity did not change over time. Distributions of functional groups based on water use and nutrient acquisition traits, and shade tolerance were similar between the partial-cut and the reference watersheds, but differed from the clear-cut watershed. By the 2010s, partial-cut and reference watersheds had similar proportions of diffuse-porous (32% and 33%) and ring-porous (48% and 42%) basal area, while the clear-cut watershed had more diffuse-porous (43%) and less ring-porous (36%) species than the partial-cut or reference watersheds. Tree species associated with arbuscular mycorrhiza were more abundant in the clear-cut watershed than the partial-cut or reference watersheds. Overall, the partial-cut watershed, even with the extreme soil disturbance, did not alter long-term species composition and diversity as dramatically as the clear-cut watershed. These results could help forest managers, conservationists, and hydrologists understand the long-term effects of partial-cutting versus clear-cutting. {\textcopyright} 2019, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.},

abstract = {Human activities affect both tree species composition and diversity in forested ecosystems. This in turn alters the species diversity of plant litter and litter quality, which may have cascading effects on soil microbial communities and their functions for decomposition and nutrient cycling. We tested microbial responses to litter species diversity in a leaf litter decomposition experiment including monocultures, 2-, and 4-species mixtures in the subtropical climate zone of southeastern China. Soil microbial community composition was assessed by lipid analysis, and microbial functions were measured using extracellular enzyme activity and gross rates of nitrogen mineralization. We observed a positive relationship between litter species diversity and abundances of mycorrhizal fungi and actinomycetes. Alternatively, enzyme activities involved in carbon and phosphorus acquisition, and enzyme indices of relative carbon limitation, were higher only in the 4-species mixtures. This suggests that the minimum basal substrate level for enzyme production was reached, or that limitation was higher, at the highest diversity level only. Responses to litter diversity also changed over time, where phosphatase responses to litter diversity were strongest early in decomposition and the indices of carbon limitation relative to other nutrients showed stronger responses later in decomposition. Enzyme activities were related to lipid biomarker data and the mass of litter remaining at the third time point, but relationships between enzyme activity and the mass of litter remaining were not consistent across other time points. We conclude that litter species richness will likely only reduce microbial functions at key intervals of diversity loss while microbial growth is more sensitive to incremental diversity loss, with no clear relationships between them or to ecosystem functions. The observed litter diversity effects on soil microbial biomass and enzyme activity indicate interactions of aboveground and belowground communities, and together with environmental conditions they are important for maintaining ecosystem functions. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract = {The turnover of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal biomass represents a significant input into forest carbon (C) and nutrient cycles. Given the size of these fluxes, understanding the factors that control the decomposition of this necromass will greatly improve understanding of C and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Recent research has highlighted the considerable variation in the decomposition rates of EM fungal necromass, and patterns from this research are beginning to emerge. In this article we review the research that has examined both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that control the decomposition of EM fungal necromass and propose additional factors that may strongly influence EM fungal necromass decomposition and ecosystem properties. We argue that, as with most plant litters, the stoichiometry (C:N) of EM necromass is an important factor governing decomposition, but its role is modulated by the nature of the C and N in the tissue. In particular, melanin concentration appears to negatively influence the quality of EM fungal necromass much as lignin does in plant litters. Other intrinsic factors such as the morphology of the mycelium may also play a large role and suggest this as a focus for future research. Extrinsic factors, such as decomposer community activity and physical protection by soil, are also likely to be important in governing the decomposition of ectomycorrhizal necromass in situ. Finally, we highlight the potential importance of EM fungal necromass diversity and abundance in influencing terrestrial biogeochemical cycles. Understanding the factors that control the decomposition of EM necromass will then improve the predictive power of next-generation terrestrial biosphere models. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background and Aims Most fully mycoheterotrophic (MH) orchids investigated to date are mycorrhizal with fungi that simultaneously form ectomycorrhizas with forest trees. Only a few MH orchids are currently known to be mycorrhizal with saprotrophic, mostly wood-decomposing, fungi instead of ectomycorrhizal fungi. This study provides evidence that the importance of associations between MH orchids and saprotrophic non-Rhizoctonia fungi is currently under-estimated. Methods Using microscopic techniques and molecular approaches, mycorrhizal fungi were localized and identified for seven MH orchid species from four genera and two subfamilies, Vanilloideae and Epidendroideae, growing in four humid and warm sub-tropical forests in Taiwan. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope natural abundances of MH orchids and autotrophic reference plants were used in order to elucidate the nutritional resources utilized by the orchids. Key Results Six out of the seven MH orchid species were mycorrhizal with either wood- or litter-decaying saprotrophic fungi. Only one orchid species was associated with ectomycorrhizal fungi. Stable isotope abundance patterns showed significant distinctions between orchids mycorrhizal with the three groups of fungal hosts. Conclusions Mycoheterotrophic orchids utilizing saprotrophic non-Rhizoctonia fungi as a carbon and nutrient source are clearly more frequent than hitherto assumed. On the basis of this kind of nutrition, orchids can thrive in deeply shaded, light-limiting forest understoreys even without support from ectomycorrhizal fungi. Sub-tropical East Asia appears to be a hotspot for orchids mycorrhizal with saprotrophic non-Rhizoctonia fungi. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Author 2015.

abstract = {Aims: This study aimed to determine the influence of tree species on soil microbial community structure.
Methods: We conducted a litter and root manipulation and a short-term nitrogen (N) addition experiment in 19-year-old broadleaf Mytilaria laosensis (Hamamelidaceae) and coniferous Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations in subtropical China. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to examine treatment effects on soil microbial community structure. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to determine the relationships between individual PLFAs and soil properties (soil pH, carbon (C) and N concentration and C:N ratio).
Results: Soil C:N ratio was significantly greater in M. laosensis (17.9) than in C. lanceolata (16.2). Soil C:N ratio was the key factor affecting the soil microbial community regardless of tree species and the litter, root and N treatments at our study site. The fungal biomarkers, 18:1$\omega$9 and 18:2$\omega$6,9 were significantly and positively related to soil C:N ratio and the abundance of bacterial lipid biomarkers was negatively related to soil C:N ratio. N addition for 8 months did not change the biomass and structure of the microbial community in M. laosensis and C. lanceolata soils. Soil nutrient availability before N addition was an important factor in determining the effect of N fertilization on soil microbial biomass and activity. PLFA analysis showed that root exclusion significantly decreased the abundance of the fungal biomarkers and increased the abundance of the Gram-positive bacteria. Rootless plots had a relatively lower Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria ratio and a higher fungi to bacteria ratio compared to the plots with roots under both M. laosensis and C. lanceolata. The response of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (16:1$\omega$5) to root exclusion was species-specific.
Conclusions: These observations suggest that soil C:N ratio was an important factor in influencing soil microbial community structure. Further studies are required to confirm the long-term effect of tree species on soil microbial community structure. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

Such installations, when placed in mature forest soils, can be expected to disrupt ectomycorrhizal fungal communities when root-associated mycelia and exploratory hyphae are damaged during excavation. Soil fungal communities, bacterial communities, and soil enzymatic repertoires may be variably impacted by different site preparation schemes after disturbance. We compared effects of three rehabilitation schemes on fungal community composition, bacterial community composition, and potential hydrolase activities (N-acetyl-$\beta$-D-glucosaminidase, acid phosphatase, and cellobiohydrolase) at two times (14 days and 5 months post-site preparation) and two sampling depths (FFOM/”upper” versus mineral/”lower” soil). We observed declines in FFOM-associated fungal biomass (ergosterol) and declines in ectomycorrhizal fungi abundance across all site rehabilitation schemes compared to intact control plots. Fungal community composition strongly shifted to saprotroph dominance (i.e. increased Mortierella, and Umbelopsis) in rehabilitated plots at 5 months, while bacterial community composition did not distinguish control plots from rehabilitation plots ones at either sampling time. Bacterial saprotrophs previously associated with mycelial necromass colonization were higher in abundance across multiple site preparation regimens compared to control plots at 14 days. Our results indicate that reductions in ectomycorrhizal fungal abundance were a dominant community property in recently reconstructed soil profiles. Increases in bacteria associated with recently deposited fungal necromass were detectable within days to weeks of implementing site rehabilitation, while fungal necromass colonizers became dominant 5 months post-rehabilitation. Potential hydrolase activities increased in the site preparation regimen where FFOM was mixed into mineral soil, when compared to mineral soil activities in control plots. {\textcopyright} 2019},

To assess the species richness, biomass, and community assemblages of truffle-like fungi in different habitats we sampled sporocarps of truffle-like fungi in three eucalypt-dominated forest types (grassy woodland, wet sclerophyll forest, and dry sclerophyll forest) once in summer and once in winter, at two sites (Mount Kaputar and New England) in northern New South Wales, Australia. One hundred and eighteen species in 35 genera were collected; over half (51.7 %) of the species were undescribed. Grassy woodland and wet forest communities had greater species richness and a lower standing crop than dry forest communities. Species richness and standing crop was greater in winter than in summer. Overall, species from the family Russulaceae, and the genera Dermocybe, Descomyces, and Hysterangium were dominant. Community composition varied among forest types and each forest type exhibited a suite of unique and common species, although much variation was unexplained. Variation in community structure was associated with some habitat attributes; at Mount Kaputar, woody plant species richness, canopy cover, litter depth, soil phosphorous, and elevation helped explain the sporocarp communities of different forest types, while at New England, woody plant species richness, rainfall, topographic aspect, soil texture, and soil nitrogen helped explain communities. This work contributes to knowledge of truffle-like fungal diversity, the factors affecting sporocarp distribution across landscapes, and the availability of sporocarps as a food resource for mycophagous mammals. Greater understanding of fungal diversity and mammal-fungal interactions also has important implications for managing forest biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Mushroom Research Foundation.},

abstract = {Chronic N deposition to forests may induce N saturation and stand decline, leading to reduced ecosystem N retention capacity, triggered by a shift from N limitation of trees to limitation by another nutrient. We conducted a 15N soil labelling experiment in non-fertilized and P-fertilized plots at two elevations in an N-saturated Mediterranean-fir (Abies pinsapo) forest in southern Spain which shows P limitation symptoms. Root-exclusion was applied to identify the relative contributions of roots (plus mycorrhizal fungi) uptake, and heterotrophic immobilization by free-living microbes, to N retention. Overall 15N recovery from the litter, 0-15-cm soil and root-uptake components was c.a. 35% higher in P-fertilized than in non-fertilized plots at both elevations. In non-fertilized plots, soil was the biggest sink for added 15N. Phosphorus fertilization increased the competitive ability of tree roots for soil N resulting in equal importance of the autotrophic (roots plus associated mycorhizal fungi) and heterotrophic (free-living microbes) components with respect to total 15N recovery in P-fertilized plots. Phosphorus addition increased litter and soil N immobilization only if roots had been excluded. By combining in situ fertilization, root-exclusion and isotope labelling we have demonstrated that reduced N retention capacity and dominance of soil microbial over plant immobilization in a N-saturated forest results from a shift from N to P limitation of trees, while alleviation of P limitation makes tree roots and associated mycorrhizal fungi competitive for N against free soil microorganisms. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Both ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic fungi are fundamental to carbon and nutrient dynamics in forest ecosystems; however, the relative importance of these different fungal functional groups for higher trophic levels of the soil food web is virtually unknown. To explore differences between fungal functional groups and their importance for higher trophic levels, we analysed isotopic composition of nitrogen and carbon in amino acids (AAs) and bulk tissue of leaf litter, fungi and fungal-feeding Diptera larvae. By accounting for isotopic variability of utilized substrates, compound-specific isotope analyses of nitrogen in AAs yielded more realistic results for the trophic position of fungi than bulk isotope analyses, with converging trophic positions of saprotrophic and ECM fungi. Saprotrophic and ECM fungi possessed different AA $\delta$13C signatures separating fungal functional groups and their consumers in fingerprinting approaches, thereby allowing to trace energy fluxes from these basal resources to higher trophic levels. A pronounced isotopic fractionation even in essential/source AAs of fungal-feeding Diptera larvae necessitates further studies on tissue-/compound-specific isotopic differences in fungi and on potential supplementation by gut micro-organisms. The results highlight the potential of compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids to identify and integrate contributions of different fungal functional groups to higher trophic levels in soil food webs.

The first rainfall after a summer drought (FRAD) induces a surge of activity of autotrophic nitrifiers having survived the drying phase. During acidification pushes an U2 stress resulting from rapid O2 consumming nitrification would induce a temporal shift of NH4+ and NO2 oxidation giving within a few days a transient peak of HNO2 accumulation injurious to fine roots and mycorrhizae. {\textcopyright} 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {To determine the dominant processes controlling nitrogen (N) dynamics in soils and increase insights into soil N cycling from nitrogen isotope ($\delta$15N) data, patterns of 15N enrichment in soil profiles were compiled from studies on tropical, temperate, and boreal systems. The maximum 15N enrichment between litter and deeper soil layers varied strongly with mycorrhizal fungal association, averaging 9. 6 ± 0. 4‰ in ectomycorrhizal systems and 4. 6 ± 0. 5‰ in arbuscular mycorrhizal systems. The 15N enrichment varied little with mean annual temperature, precipitation, or nitrification rates. One main factor controlling 15N in soil profiles, fractionation against 15N during N transfer by mycorrhizal fungi to host plants, leads to 15N-depleted plant litter at the soil surface and 15N-enriched nitrogen of fungal origin at depth. The preferential preservation of 15N-enriched compounds during decomposition and stabilization is a second important factor. A third mechanism, N loss during nitrification and denitrification, may account for large 15N enrichments with depth in less N-limited forests and may account for soil profiles where maximum $\delta$15N is at intermediate depths. Mixing among soil horizons should also decrease differences among soil horizons. We suggest that dynamic models of isotope distributions within soil profiles that can incorporate multiple processes could provide additional information about the history of nitrogen movements and transformations at a site. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract = {We synthesised results on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes and the accumulation of soil organic C and N under adjacent 50-year-old Norway spruce, Scots pine and silver birch stands growing on similar soils and evaluated the different processes involved. C and N budgets were calculated. Spruce stands had larger stocks of C and N in biomass and soil than birch stands, with pine intermediate. The differences in soil stocks were mainly found in the organic layer, whereas differences in the mineral soil were small. The study showed that there is no simple answer to what is causing the differences in soil C and N stocks, because several processes are interacting. Spruce and pine trees had higher biomass and litter production than birch trees, but total litter inputs showed no significant difference between stands, because the rich ground vegetation under pine and birch contributed with substantial litter inputs, in contrast to the poor ground vegetation under spruce. Decomposition rate (per g of C) was markedly higher under birch than under spruce and pine resulting in lower C and N stocks in the organic layer. This effect was amplified by higher abundance and biomass of earthworms, favoured by higher pH and palatable litter under birch. Earthworm bioturbation probably both increased decomposition rate and damaged the ectomycorrhizal network with negative consequences for the formation of mycorrhizal litter and C storage. In conclusion, the direct effects of spruce, pine and birch litter on C and N pools and fluxes were modified by indirect effects of understorey structure, pH and earthworm responses. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Marshall200043,
abstract = {Soil is the habitat of plant roots and the home of numerous microflora, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and blue-green algae, and a host of animals from unicellular protozoans to small vertebrates. Simple communities of soil organisms, present from the earliest stages of forest soil genesis, become more complex and grow to astronomical numbers in mature forest soils. Here, they are essential for the maintenance and productivity of these soils, which unlike agricultural systems, generally receive less mechanical treatments and chemical inputs. The soil microflora and fauna complement each other in the comminution of litter, mineralization of essential plant nutrients, and conservation of these nutrients within the soil system. Harvesting directly affects these processes through the reduction and redistribution of organic matter, compaction, changes in plant cover, and modification of microclimate, all of which affect the distribution, composition and activity of the soil biological communities. Although most information is available for clearcut forests, the limited data from other systems indicate that severity of impacts of forest harvesting practices generally follow the sequence: clearcuts > shelterwood systems > extended rotation systems. However, all practices generally affect soil organisms over the short term. Changes over the longer-term are less obvious because of gradual recovery of most biological components with canopy closure. Long-term impacts are more difficult to interpret because these are often influenced by natural changes in population dynamics of soil organisms with forest succession, drought, and the invasion of exotic species. Responses are complex, with various groups being affected differently. Even within a taxon, individual species may behave differently. Although the relationships among floral composition, faunal diversity and sustained soil fertility are not always clear, there are indications that a simplified soil biological system will adversely affect nutrient cycling, tree growth, and forest health. Decomposition rate is generally positively correlated with faunal biomass, and a diverse fauna is required for interacting with microorganisms to enhance microbial diversity. Also. feeding on microflora by the fauna concurrently controls certain plant pathogens. Destruction of mycorrhizae, essential for the establishment of coniferous seedlings, can lead to serious reforestation problems. It is therefore prudent to discourage any qualitative or quantitative changes in the soil biota. Concepts in 'new forestry' attempt to mitigate against adverse affects of conventional forest harvesting practices on soil organisms by maintaining plant biodiversity, minimizing soil compaction, avoiding extreme microclimatic conditions, providing refugia for re-colonization by the biota, and directly introducing desirable microfiora and fauna.

abstract = {A recent interest in the study of physiological and biochemical processes in the underground organs of woody plants is due, first of all, to the assessment of their contribution to the carbon balance of forest ecosystems. Root respiration provides a significant part of the total СО2 emission from the soil surface. Abies sibirica Ledeb. has a branched, but not deep, root system and prefers a certain soil fertility and moisture. This tree species does not grow on the permafrost grounds unlike Picea obovata Ledeb. and Pinus sylvestris L. Numerous literature sources describe various methods for measuring CO2 in fine roots, from laboratory measurements to calculating the proportion of root respiration in the total СО2 emission from soil. Our study is based on the original data on the respiration of non-cut roots of A. sibirica in the litter with the minimal damage of the object and environment. The aim of this research is to characterize the seasonal and daily dynamics of fine root respiration rate in A. sibirica in the bilberry-sphagnum pine forest in the middle taiga for two growing seasons. Measurements were performed from May to October in 2016 and 2018 during the vegetation periods in the bilberry-sphagnum pine forest in the middle taiga (N 62°17' E 50°40') of the 5th class of bonitet, stand composition was 9Po1Bp+Ps+As, tree age was 106-200 years, with soil as peaty-podzolic-gleyic, sandy loam, underlied by loams (Histic Albic Retisol). Weather conditions, litter temperature and moisture are presented in Table 1. Respiration of fine mycorrhizal roots (less than 2 mm in diameter) was measured in mature trees by infrared gas analyzer “Li 6400” (Li-Cor, USA) and soil camera during different times of the day in a stream of atmospheric air. Statistical data processing was performed using Microsoft Excel 2003, and STATISTICA 10. Average values of fir fine root respiration differed significantly in 2016 and 2018 and were 0.79±0.01 mg СО2 g-1h-1 and 0.58±0.01 mg СО2 g-1h-1 (Student's t-test). In 2016, respiration rate was higher in August and lower in September (See Table 2 and Table 3). In August, an increase in respiration rate was found only at noon and in the afternoon. In July, respiration rate was higher during morning and evening hours. In September, respiration rate was low during all day compared to other months. The lowest values of root СО2 emission were found in September. In 2018, respiration was high in July and low in August-September. The lowest values of СО2 emission were found in the beginning of June. July increase and September decrease in respiration rate occurred evenly in each measurement interval during the day. Thus, in July, we found higher daily fine roots' СО2 emission compared to other months. In 2016, the daily dynamics demonstrated an increase in root respiration during summer afternoons and its decrease during autumn afternoons followed by an evening increase in respiration. In 2018, summer root respiration increased in the noon and then decreased sharply in the afternoon and evening. The opposite trend was observed in September. We found a positive correlation of fir fine root respiration rate and temperature (See Table 4). The direction of moisture influence on root respiration was different. Fine root respiration rate was correlated positively with camera moisture and negatively with soil moisture. In 2018, the dependence was much stronger than in 2016. Therefore, A. sibirica fine root respiration was different during two years of observation in the bilberry-sphagnum spruce forest and correlated positively with the litter temperature, and negatively with the litter moisture. The seasonal dynamics showed an increased СО2 emission in July and August. The daily dynamics of the respiration rate was different during different vegetation periods, but, in general, the respiration rate was lower during the afternoon hours. {\textcopyright} 2020 Tomsk State University.

abstract = {Objective: Quercus virginiana (Fagaceae), native to the southeastern United States, is recently introduced to the Yangtze Delta and often planted as landscape and coastal shelter forests. Quercus root tips are often heavily colonized by a phylogenetic diverse group of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which improve nutrient acquisition and stress resistance for host plants. The purpose of this work is thus to reveal the identities of ECM fungi associated with Q. virginiana roots in the new environment. Method: The ectomycorrhizal root samples were collected at four different stages from October 2017 to August 2018 and traditional morphological description, fungal amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing approaches were used to investigate the diversity and structure dynamics of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with Q. virginiana. Result: All the examined ectomycorrhizas showed black, white, yellow, and their intermediate colors (carmine and oyster white) appearances. The presence of mantle structure was observed microscopically. Based on the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) assignment and their relative abundances, the first three colored mycorrhizas corresponded to the fungi belonging to Tomentella, Scleroderma, and Russula, respectively, which showed rich interspecific genetic diversity inferred from phylogenetic analysis. Weighted Pair-Groups Method Average (WPGMA) cluster analysis of the OTU data matrix revealed that fungal compositions of the remaining two colored-mycorrhizas were very similar to those presented in yellow and black-colored mycorrhizas, respectively, indicating the different development stage of the same type of ectomycorrhizas. In addition, a few other ectomycorrhizal taxa including Amanita, Hebeloma, Pisolithus, Lactarius, and Sebacinales were detected with low abundances. The ectomycorrhizal community structure varied obviously in different sampling time. It is mainly shown as follows: Scleroderma dominated in all samples, its abundance was high at the initial stage, and then gradually decreased and subsequently maintained a stable abundance level; On the contrary, Russula had very low proportion in first sampling time, but increased its abundance gradually; Tomentella was not changed remarkably, with one exception was the second sampling time, in which Tomentella was abundant and comparable to Scleroderma. This observation was also consistent with the emergence of epigeous fruiting bodies of Scleroderma and Russula observed in the field. The non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that there were obvious differences in the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities of the root tips samples from four sampling periods of time (stress=0.157). Highest $\alpha$-diversity indices (Chao1, ACE, Shannon, and Simpson) were observed in the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities of pooled samples collected at the second sampling period. Also, the greatest pairwise dissimilarity value occurred between the samples from the first and fourth sampling period of time based on $\beta$-diversity heatmap. Conclusion: The ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with Q. virginiana are mainly composed of Tomentella, Scleroderma and Russula. There are significant changes of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities at different growth stages, which are probably correlated with the changes of soil moisture and temperature. The results also gain the highlights on exploiting ectomycorrhizal fungi for mycobiont-based Q. virginiana cultivation technology. {\textcopyright} 2020, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

abstract = {Studies of the ecology of micro-organisms began only recently despite their intrinsic importance - both practical and theoretical - and their central role in forming the niche habitats of macro-organisms. Plant-fungi interactions offer a relevant model for studies of the ecology of micro-organisms interacting with macro-organisms because of their considerable ecological and economic value as well as their high taxonomic and ecological diversity. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and network analysis, we explored some of the drivers of fungal community composition in Corsica, at various scales and in three ecological guilds: ectomycorrhizal, endophytic and saprotrophic fungi. We investigated the effects on fungal communities of disturbance (e.g. fire and treefall), environmental variables (e.g. soil depth), constraints due to interactions with host plants (e.g. taxonomy) and dispersion. Some patterns of community assembly are similar across guilds and may be governed by the same mechanisms. We found wide variations in fungal communities at the micro-regional scale among the guilds studied and between forests with a different history of wildfires. However, the relative importance of assembly processes and the spatial scales at which they occur vary across guilds. In Corsican pine forests, fifteen years after a fire, the diversity of soil fungus is close to the diversity in unburned stands. Despite the absence of effects on diversity, fire produces clear shifts in the composition of soil fungus communities, in particular for saprobic fungi. We discuss the implications of these findings for plant and fungal community ecologists and for managers of natural areas.},

abstract = {The availability of soil nutrients (especially phosphorus) and soil water strongly infuence mycorrhizal symbiosis in forest ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of litter removal and increased soil moisture availability on the spore density and mycorrhizal colonization of apogeotropic and non-apogeotropic roots of a secondary forest stand in eastern Amazonia. We determined the percentage of mycorrhizal colonization of apogeotropic and non-apogeotropic (0-10 cm soil depth) fine roots (diameter ≤ 2 mm), spore density, glomalin concentration, and soil phosphorus availability. Litter removal did not reduce soil phosphorus availability. The spore density was not afected by litter removal. In general, the variables varied on a seasonal basis, except the mycorrizal colonization of non-apogetropic roots and glomalin concentration, but were not afected by irrigation. Mechanical damage to the apogeotropic root system, inherent to the fortnightly litter removal, may have contributed to decrease mycorrhizal colonization of both apogeotropic and non-apogeotropic roots and, consequently, soil glomalin. Our results suggest that the reduction of soil cover may have negative impact over the fungus-plant symbiosis. {\textcopyright} 2015, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia.

abstract = {We assessed the environmental variables associated with fructification, phenology, abundance, frequency and relative productivity of lignicolous and terrestrial wild edible fungi from Nothofagus forests in the Andean-Patagonia region of Argentina. The study was carried out during autumn 2010, 2011 and 2012. The mycorrhizal species Cortinarius magellanicus and C. xiphidipus were associated with a deep litter layer, whereas the saprophytic Lycoperdon sp. showed lower litter depth values. All the terrestrial species developed under high canopy cover (above 75%). Lignicolous species such as Clitocybula dusenii and Aleurodiscus vitellinus were more frequently observed in open places, whereas Fistulina. antarctica, F. endoxantha and Grifola gargal seem to prefer high canopy cover. Fruiting of F. antarctica was associated with low wood degradation stage, vs. high wood degradation stage in the case of C. dusenii. F. antarctica, Ramaria patagonica, C. magellanicus and A. vitellinus were found to have longer fruiting periods, from mid-March to mid-April. The most productive species in terms of fresh weight were R. patagonica and F. antarctica. The information provided here is critical to establish guidelines for harvesting these species based on their availability, ensuring their sustainable use.},

abstract = {In boreal and temperate forests fungi play a particularly important role, since most trees form a symbiotic relationship with many species of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, providing them with assimilates in exchange for minerals. Mycorrhiza is considered one of the most significant factors affecting functioning of forest ecosystems, and in particular the processes of carbon cycling and storage. ECM fungi are involved both directly through carbon accumulation in the mycelial system, and indirectly through their influence on tree biomass production and organic matter decomposition. The amount of carbon transferred to ECM fungi usually varies from 10 to 25 or even 50% of the host's net photosynthesis, thus they are a group of organisms that significantly affect carbon flow into the soil. Most of that carbon is built into the mycelial system and its structures (fungal parts of ECM roots, extramatrical hyphae and rhizomorphs, sporocarps, etc.). Carbon allocation to the underground part of trees, and thus to ECM roots, changes with stand age and stand development phase. The biomass of active ECM roots and mycelium usually reaches its maximum in young stands, in the canopy closure phase; frequently, this is also true for the standing biomass of fruit bodies. A large share of ECM sporocarps in the forest carbon budget and high levels of ECM vegetative mycelium respiration are considered to be among the main pathways for the release of CO2 from forest soil, indicating a significant role of ECM fungi in fast carbon flow via forest ecosystems. On the other hand, dead ECM fine roots and extramatrical mycelia are a very rich and important pool of sequestered carbon in the soil.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyze the diversity of species that compose the saprotrophic (anamorphic Ascomycota) fungi community in the leaf litter and soil in Celtis tala forest in Magdalena, located in the province of Buenos Aires. Seasonal samples were taken during two years (2004-2005), and fungi were isolated and identified. The relative frequencies of fungi were calculated. To compare the similarity of the fungi composition between different habitats, Sorensen's index of similarity (S') was applied. The frequencies of occurrence of these fungi were recorded and Shannon Weaver index (H') was applied to evaluate fungal diversity. A total of 104 taxa of anamorphic fungi were identified from which 54 were isolated from leaf litter, 58 from soil, and 8 species common for both types of substrate. From the taxa identified, those that had higher frequencies for leaf litter were the less represented in soil and vice versa. Sorensen's index of similarity resulted 0.14, which means that the saprotrophic fungi community that grows in leaf litter of Celtis tala is composed by different species than those that characterized the mycobiota from the soil of the same area. Nevertheless, no significant differences were found in the index of diversity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Sociedad Argentina de Botanica.},

abstract = {Activity of fungi participating in the dead wood decomposition was studied in the Velk{\'{y}} Polom Nature Reserve, Protected Landscape Area {\v{Z}}elezn{\'{e}} hory. Two game-proof fences of an area of 0.30 ha (570 m alt.) and 0.19 ha (620 m alt.) were used as permanent sample plots. In both the plots, activities were monitored of wood-destroying fungi in 126.82 m 3 dead wood, 104.05 m3 of which were in beech. After conversion to an area, the volume amounts to 258.82 m3 per ha. In the whole reserve, almost 220 species of macromycetes were recorded in the course of a mycological survey. Wood-destroying fungi are the dominant component of mycoflora representing more than 50% identified taxa of in the period under study. The proportion of mycorrhizal fungi amounted to 14%. A series of macromycetes considered to be saprophytes is bound to products of wood decomposition. Fomes fomentarius (L.) Fr., Fomitopsis pinicola (Sowerby) P. Karst., Ustulina deusta (Fr.) Petrak, Hypoxylon fragiforme (Pers.) Kickx, Ganoderma lipsiense (Batsch) Atk. and the genus Armillaria were the predominant species of wood-decaying fungi. As for rare macro-fungi, it is possible to mention Ascotremella faginea (Peck) Seaver, Stropharia albocrenulata (Peck) Kreisel and Tricholomopsis decora (Fr.) Singer.},

abstract = {Physiological changes of the ectomycorrhizal plants cause that microorganisms of the mycorrhizosphere differ from those of the root free soil and the rhizosphere. Soil microorganisms are capable of producing and decomposing plant growth regulators. Different soil microorganisms produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) especially in the presence of tryptophan. Without this aminoacid less or no auxins are produced. Plants are capable of taking up the microbiologically formed auxins. Microorganisms are also forming and decomposing ethylene. Microbial formation of gibberellins is also known that microorganisms are capable of gibberellins but less is known about microbial decomposition of this phytohormone by soil microorganisms. B-group vitamins are produced by a wide range of microorganisms. These (and especially thiamin and biotin) are often required by ectomycorrhizal fungi. It seems that plant growth substances are not essential for soil or rhizosphere microorganisms.},

abstract = {The apterygote Protura may be used as very sensitive bioindicators. They are dependant on the vitality of mycorrhiza. Phytophagous soil insects accumulated inorganic substances obtained by food to some extent, and may serve, also, saprophagous soil animals, as accumulative bioindicators, especially of heavy metals. Fluctuations of population density and litter decomposition often reflect serious external events. The drastic decrease of abundance and decomposition in 1981 are correlated mainly with the extraordinary cool and dry weather during the vegetation period of 1980. Spruce Picea abies might also be influenced by these conditions. Fungal pests and contamination (acid rain, etc) might be responsible for the serious forest diseases, especially in some parts of SW Germany. -from English summary},

@article{OConnell1983,
abstract = {The amount of calcium in Eucalyptus diversicolor (karri) ecosystems is high in comparison with other eucalypt forest ecosystems in Australia. A large proportion of this calcium is present as crystalline Ca oxalate. Whewellite (CaC2O4{\textperiodcentered}H2O) accumulates in leaf tissue of the over- and understorey species. Up to 70% of the calcium in the leaves of karri is stored as whewellite, the highest concentrations occurring in the oldest leaves. Synthesis of Ca oxalate by karri may be related in part to the high levels of exchangeable soil calcium. Oxalate of plant origin is rapidly metabolized on the forest floor during decomposition of leaf litter. About 70% of the whewellite in fresh karri leaf litter is degraded during the first wet season following leaf fall. However, additional oxalate is formed in the soil and litter layer from microbial production of oxalic acid. These crystals are of the dihydrate calcium salt, weddelite (CaC2CO4{\textperiodcentered} 2H2O). Microbial production of oxalate, particularly by ectomycorrhizal fungi, may be an important mechanism for mobilizing of phosphate from the strongly phosphateadsorbing soils on which these forests grow. {\textcopyright} 1983 Springer-Verlag.},
