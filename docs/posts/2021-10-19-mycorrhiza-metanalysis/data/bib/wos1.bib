Abstract = {{Changes in the climate may have unpredictable effects on belowground
   carbon processes and thus, the carbon balance of boreal forests. To
   understand the interactions of these processes in soil and to quantify
   the potential changes in the carbon cycle, partitioning of forest floor
   respiration is crucial. For this purpose, we used nine different
   treatments to separate the sources of forest floor carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions in a mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand in southern
   Finland. To partition the belowground CO2 emissions, we used two
   different trenching methods: 1) to exclude roots and mycorrhizal fungal
   mycelia (mesh with 1-mu m pores) and 2) to exclude roots, but not
   mycorrhizal hyphae (mesh with 50-mu m pores). Additionally, we used 3) a
   control treatment that included roots and fungal hyphae. To partition
   the CO2 emissions from the forest floor vegetation, we 1) removed it, 2)
   left only the dwarf shrubs, or 3) left the vegetation intact. The forest
   floor CO2 emissions were regularly measured with a flux chamber
   throughout the growing seasons in 2013-2015. The total forest floor
   respiration was partitioned into respiration of tree roots (contributing
   48\%), heterotrophic soil respiration (30\%) and respiration of ground
   vegetation other than shrubs (10\%), dwarf shrubs (8\%), and hyphae of
   mycorrhizal fungi (4\%). Heterotrophic respiration increased in the
   trenched treatments without ground vegetation over time, due to the
   so-called `Gadgil effect'. In the absence of tree mots, but when hyphal
   access was allowed, respiration in the dwarf shrub treatment increased
   throughout the experiment. This indicated that dwarf shrubs had fungal
   connections to outside the experimental plots via their ericoid
   mycorrhiza. At the same time, other ground vegetation, such as mosses,
   suppressed the dwarf shrub respiration in trenched treatments. Our
   results show that competition on the forest floor is intense between
   plant roots and soil microbes.}},

Title = {{Fine roots and mycorrhizal fungi accelerate leaf litter decomposition in
   a northern hardwood forest regardless of dominant tree mycorrhizal
   associations}},
Journal = {{NEW PHYTOLOGIST}},
Abstract = {{Fine roots and mycorrhizal fungi may either stimulate leaf litter
   decomposition by providing free-living decomposers with root-derived
   carbon, or may slow decomposition through nutrient competition between
   mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi.
   We reduced the presence of fine roots and their associated mycorrhizal
   fungi in a northern hardwood forest in New Hampshire, USA by soil
   trenching. Plots spanned a mycorrhizal gradient from 96\% arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) associations to 100\% ectomycorrhizal (ECM)-associated
   tree basal area. We incubated four species of leaf litter within these
   plots in areas with reduced access to roots and mycorrhizal fungi and in
   adjacent areas with intact roots and mycorrhizal fungi.
   Over a period of 608 d, we found that litter decayed more rapidly in the
   presence of fine roots and mycorrhizal hyphae regardless of the dominant
   tree mycorrhizal association. Root and mycorrhizal exclusion reduced the
   activity of acid phosphatase on decomposing litter.
   Our results indicate that both AM- and ECM-associated fine roots
   stimulate litter decomposition in this system. These findings suggest
   that the effect of fine roots and mycorrhizal fungi on litter decay in a
   particular ecosystem likely depends on whether interactions between
   mycorrhizal roots and saprotrophic fungi are antagonistic or
   facilitative. ????}},

Title = {{Rapid responses of root traits and productivity to phosphorus and cation
   additions in a tropical lowland forest in Amazonia}},
Journal = {{NEW PHYTOLOGIST}},
Abstract = {{Soil nutrient availability can strongly affect root traits. In tropical
   forests, phosphorus (P) is often considered the main limiting nutrient
   for plants. However, support for the P paradigm is limited, and N and
   cations might also control tropical forests functioning.
   We used a large-scale experiment to determine how the factorial addition
   of nitrogen (N), P and cations affected root productivity and traits
   related to nutrient acquisition strategies (morphological traits,
   phosphatase activity, arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation and nutrient
   contents) in a primary rainforest growing on low-fertility soils in
   Central Amazonia after 1 yr of fertilisation.
   Multiple root traits and productivity were affected. Phosphorus
   additions increased annual root productivity and root diameter, but
   decreased root phosphatase activity. Cation additions increased root
   productivity at certain times of year, also increasing root diameter and
   mycorrhizal colonisation. P and cation additions increased their element
   concentrations in root tissues. No responses were detected with N
   addition.
   Here we showed that rock-derived nutrients determined root functioning
   in low-fertility Amazonian soils, demonstrating not only the
   hypothesised importance of P, but also highlighting the role of cations.
   The changes in fine root traits and productivity indicated that even
   slow-growing tropical rainforests can respond rapidly to changes in
   resource availability.}},

Title = {{Soil microbial community composition and function are closely associated
   with soil organic matter chemistry along a latitudinal gradient}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{383}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Despite the important roles of microorganisms in soil organic matter
   (SOM) decomposition and nutrient cycling, how their biomass, community
   composition and function are driven by a joint effect of edaphic and
   environmental factors at a large spatial scale remains unclear.
   Moreover, a mechanistic understanding of the associations among
   microbial communities and SOM chemistry as a key indicator of substrate
   availability over large spatial scales has been lacking until now. To
   fill this knowledge gap, we examined how soil microbial community
   abundance and composition (via phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis)
   and function (via enzyme activities and net N mineralization) were
   associated with the edaphic and environmental factors from six oriental
   oak (Quercus variabilis) forest sites arranged across a 11 degrees
   latitudinal gradient in East China. We found strong relationships
   between SOM chemistry as indicated by C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) spectroscopy and microbial community composition and function
   along this gradient. For example, the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F/B)
   decreased with increasing carboxyl C percentage; the lower abundance of
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and decreased invertase activity in
   the southern sites were possibly related to higher ratio of alkyl to O
   alkyl (A/O); urease activity increased with carboxyl C percentage.
   Microbial biomass (total PLFAs) had positive relationships with urease
   activity, net N mineralization rate, and soil pH. Mean annual
   precipitation (MAP) and pH were important for overall microbial
   community composition. Overall, our results indicate that SOM chemistry
   is closely related to microbial community composition and function along
   the latitudinal gradient and should be considered in future studies. Our
   study contributes to a better prediction of microbial responses to
   possible substrate changes brought by future environmental changes,
   which is urgently needed under the context of accelerating global
   change.}},

Title = {{The endangered epiphytic orchid Dendrobium okinawense has a highly
   specific mycorrhizal association with a single Tulasnellaceae fungus}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Epiphytic orchids, which account for 68\% of vascular epiphytes,
   contribute substantially to plant species diversity in forest canopies.
   Many orchid species are naturally rare and have limited geographical
   distributions. All orchids rely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient
   acquisition during seed germination and seedling establishment, and many
   species retain these associations throughout their lifecycle. Due to
   their reliance on mycorrhizal fungi, epiphytic orchid species with
   highly specific mycorrhizal associations may be geographically
   restricted and are often rare. Dendrobium okinawense is a rare epiphytic
   orchid endemic to the Yambaru Forest in Japan and to southern Taiwan. We
   hypothesized that this species exhibits high mycorrhizal specificity and
   tested this hypothesis via identification of the species' mycorrhizal
   associates. We collected root samples of this orchid from four tree
   species and assessed mycorrhizal fungi in 25 root fragments harvested
   from 10 plants. Fungi were identified using molecular methods based on
   fungal isolates and DNA extracted from mycorrhizal roots. Detected fungi
   were assigned to 21 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97\%
   sequence similarity of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer
   region sequences. TU11, an OTU belonging to Tulasnellaceae
   (Basidiomycota), was the most frequently detected OTU, occurring in 20
   root fragments from all 10 sampled individuals. Our results indicate
   that Dendrobium okinawense has a highly specific association with TU11.
   Further, this specificity may be high relative to the Dendrobium species
   assessed in other studies. These findings support the hypothesis that
   Dendrobium okinawense exhibits high mycorrhizal specificity.}},

Title = {{Root-derived inputs are major contributors to soil carbon in temperate
   forests, but vary by mycorrhizal type}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY LETTERS}},
Abstract = {{Roots promote the formation of slow-cycling soil carbon (C), yet we have
   a limited understanding of the magnitude and controls on this flux. We
   hypothesised arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)- and ectomycorrhizal
   (ECM)-associated trees would exhibit differences in root-derived C
   accumulation in the soil, and that much of this C would be transferred
   into mineral-associated pools. We installed delta C-13-enriched ingrowth
   cores across mycorrhizal gradients in six Eastern U.S. forests (n = 54
   plots). Overall, root-derived C was 54\% greater in AM versus
   ECM-dominated plots. This resulted in nearly twice as much root-derived
   C in putatively slow-cycling mineral-associated pools in AM compared to
   ECM plots. Given that our estimates of root-derived inputs were often
   equal to or greater than leaf litter inputs, our results suggest that
   variation in root-derived soil C accumulation due to tree mycorrhizal
   dominance may be a key control of soil C dynamics in forests.}},

Title = {{Vegetation recovery alters soil N status in subtropical karst plateau
   area: Evidence from natural abundance delta N-15 and delta O-18}},
Journal = {{PLANT AND SOIL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Forest recovery from disturbance can alter soil nitrogen (N)
   status as a result of complex interactions in plant-soil system. The
   delta N-15 and delta O-18 are indicators that integrate complex soil N
   processes and can help elucidate changes in soil N status. Our
   objectives were to evaluate differences in soil N status among different
   forest recovery stages in karst plateau in southwestern China.
   Methods We established a forest recovery gradient with sites in
   cropland, abandoned cropland, shrub land, and early- and
   late-successional forests. We measured concentrations and isotopic
   compositions of soil total N, ammonium (NH4+), and nitrate (NO3-), and
   delta N-15 of plant tissue.
   Results With increased levels of recovery, concentrations of soil total
   N increased, and delta N-15 of soil total N (delta N-15(STN)) decreased
   at 0 similar to 10 cm depth. A positive relationship between delta
   N-15(STN) in surface soil and delta N-15 of plant (P < 0.05) suggested
   that recovery of plant biomass was the main contributor to soil N
   recovery. A large difference between delta N-15 of litter and delta
   N-15(STN) demonstrated an important dependence of plants on mycorrhizal
   fungi for N acquisition. delta N-15 of NH4+ was lower than delta
   N-15(STN), and a significant correlation between delta N-15 and delta
   O-18 of NO3- was observed only in late-successional forest (slope =
   l.4), indicating that gas N emission had a minor contribution to N loss.
   Ratio of ammonium N to nitrate N was < 1 (except in cropland),
   suggesting low risk of leaching.
   Conclusions Forest recovery promoted soil N recovery, and reduced soil N
   loss in karst plateau. However, N limitation persisted throughout forest
   recovery stages.}},

Title = {{Seasonal Changes in Pinus tabuliformis Root-Associated Fungal Microbiota
   Drive N and P Cycling in Terrestrial Ecosystem}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JAN 18}},
Abstract = {{In terrestrial ecosystems, mycorrhizal roots play a key role in the
   cycling of soil carbon (C) and other nutrients. The impact of
   environmental factors on the mycorrhizal fungal community has been well
   studied; however, the seasonal variations in the root-associated fungal
   microbiota affected by environmental changes are less clear. To improve
   the understanding of how environmental factors shape the fungal
   microbiota in mycorrhizal roots, seasonal changes in Pinus tabuliformis
   root-associated fungi were investigated. In the present study, the
   seasonal dynamics of edaphic properties, soil enzymatic activities, root
   fungal colonization rates, and root-associated fungal microbiota in P.
   tabuliformis forests were studied across four seasons during a whole
   year to reveal their correlations with environmental changes. The
   results indicate that the soil functions, such as the enzymatic
   activities related to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) degradation, were
   varied with the seasonal changes in microclimate factors, resulting in a
   significant fluctuation of edaphic properties. In addition, the
   ectomycorrhizal fungal colonization rate in the host pine tree roots
   increased during warm seasons (summer and autumn), while the fungal
   colonization rate of dark septate endophyte was declined. Moreover, the
   present study indicates that the fungal biomass increased in both the
   pine roots and rhizospheric soils during warm seasons, while the fungal
   species richness and diversity decreased. While the Basidiomycota and
   Ascomycota were the two dominant phyla in both root and soil fungal
   communities, the higher relative abundance of Basidiomycota taxa
   presented in warm seasons. In addition, the fungal microbial network
   complexity declined under the higher temperature and humidity
   conditions. The present study illustrates that the varieties in
   connectivity between the microbial networks and in functional taxa of
   root-associated fungal microbiota significantly influence the soil
   ecosystem functions, especially the N and P cycling.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{480}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Although replanting broad-leaved trees in coniferous forest has been
   proven to increase stand soil quality, it is unclear how this prevalent
   forest management regime affects the soil fungal communities of
   individual conifers in mixed forest. Herein, we chose two representative
   coniferous tree species (Pinus massoniana and Pinus elliottii) and
   employed high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR to investigate
   fungal community composition and function in rhizosphere soils under
   monoculture and in mixed forests (replanted with Schima superba for 13
   years) in subtropical China. Mixing with broad-leaved trees resulted in
   increased rhizosphere soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient (total
   nitrogen, NH4+ and available phosphorus). Rhizosphere soil fungal
   abundance (ITS gene copy numbers) and community diversity of conifers
   were increased after mixing. Meanwhile, the soil fungal abundance and
   ACE richness index in Masson pine were higher compared with slash pine
   whether in monoculture or mixed forests. Ascomycota, Basidiomycota,
   Mortierellomycota and Glomeromycota were the dominant phyla in soils.
   Mixing with broad-leaved trees decreased the relative abundance of
   Ascomycota, while it increased Basidiomycota and Glomeromycota in the
   rhizosphere soil of conifers. Moreover, there was a decrease in the
   relative abundance of animal pathogens and wood saprotrophic fungi,
   while soil saprotrophic fungi, ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi were increased in rhizosphere soil of conifers after
   mixing, suggesting changes from saprotrophic fungi to symbiotrophic
   fungi to increase soil nutrient supply and enhance tree nutrient uptake.
   Principal coordinates analysis showed that the fungal communities in
   mixed forests clustered closely and were separated from monoculture
   forests. Fungal community composition and function were mainly dependent
   on SOC. Our results indicate that mixing with broad-leaved trees
   increases fungal abundance, alters fungal community composition and
   function and thus potentially contributes to soil quality improvement
   and tree nutrient acquisition of conifers. Masson pine is more adaptable
   than slash pine to establish mixed forest in subtropical China.}},

Abstract = {{Mycoheterotrophic plants (MHPs) are leafless, achlorophyllous, and
   completely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for their carbon supply.
   Mycorrhizal symbiosis is a mutualistic association with fungi that is
   undertaken by the majority of land plants, but mycoheterotrophy
   represents a breakdown of this mutualism in that plants parasitize
   fungi. Most MHPs are associated with fungi that are mycorrhizal with
   autotrophic plants, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or
   ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Although these MHPs gain carbon via the
   common mycorrhizal network that links the surrounding autotrophic
   plants, some mycoheterotrophic lineages are associated with saprotrophic
   (SAP) fungi, which are free-living and decompose leaf litter and wood
   materials. Such MHPs are dependent on the forest carbon cycle, which
   involves the decomposition of wood debris and leaf litter, and have a
   unique biology and evolutionary history. MHPs associated with SAP fungi
   (SAP-MHPs) have to date been found only in the Orchidaceae and likely
   evolved independently at least nine times within that family.
   Phylogenetically divergent SAP Basidiomycota, mostly Agaricales but also
   Hymenochaetales, Polyporales, and others, are involved in
   mycoheterotrophy. The fungal specificity of SAP-MHPs varies from a
   highly specific association with a single fungal species to a broad
   range of interactions with multiple fungal orders. Establishment of
   symbiotic culture systems is indispensable for understanding the
   mechanisms underlying plant-fungus interactions and the conservation of
   MHPs. Symbiotic culture systems have been established for many SAP-MHP
   species as a pure culture of free-living SAP fungi is easier than that
   of biotrophic AM or ECM fungi. Culturable SAP-MHPs are useful research
   materials and will contribute to the advancement of plant science.}},

   had more favorable conditions for the formation of mull humus and
   exhibited higher N and Ca contents. These conditions were also
   associated with a higher proportion of Betaproteobacteria,

   quality as well as lower bacterial and fungal diversity characterized
   higher altitude levels, along with a high proportion of shared bacterial

   Particularly, the Basidiomycota were well represented in pure beech

   Soil}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background and objectives: aggregation and structure play key roles in
   the water-holding capacity and stability of soils and are important for
   the physical protection and storage of soil carbon (C). Forest soils are
   an important sink of ecosystem C, though the capacity to store C may be
   disrupted by the elevated atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) and
   sulfur (S) compounds by dispersion of soil aggregates via acidification
   or altered microbial activity. Furthermore, dominant tree species and
   the lability of litter they produce can influence aggregation processes.
   Materials and methods: we measured water-stable aggregate size
   distribution and aggregate-associated organic matter (OM) content in
   soils from two watersheds and beneath four hardwood species at the USDA
   Forest Service Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA, where
   one watershed has received (NH4)(2)SO4 fertilizer since 1989 and one is
   a reference/control of similar stand age. Bulk soil OM, pH, and
   permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) were also measured. Research
   highlights: fertilized soil exhibited decreased macro-aggregate
   formation and a greater proportion of smaller micro-aggregates or
   unassociated clay minerals, particularly in the B-horizon. This shift in
   aggregation to soil more dominated by the smallest (<53 mu m) fraction
   is associated with both acidification (soil pH) and increased
   microbially processed C (POXC) in fertilized soil. Intra-aggregate OM
   was also depleted in the fertilized soil (52\% less OM in the 53-2000 mu
   m fractions), most strongly in subsurface B-horizon soil. We also
   document that tree species can influence soil aggregation, as soil
   beneath species with more labile litter contained more OM in the
   micro-aggregate size class (<250 mu m), especially in the fertilized
   watershed, while species with more recalcitrant litter promoted more OM
   in the macro-aggregate size classes (500-2000 mu m) in the reference
   watershed. Conclusions: long-term fertilization, and likely historic
   atmospheric deposition, of forest soils has weakened macro-aggregation
   formation, with implications for soil stability, hydrology, and storage
   of belowground C.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, metabarcoding has become a key tool to describe
   microbial communities from natural and artificial environments. Thanks
   to its high throughput nature, metabarcoding efficiently explores
   microbial biodiversity under different conditions. It can be performed
   on environmental (e)DNA to describe so-called total microbial community,
   or from environmental (e)RNA to describe active microbial community. As
   opposed to total microbial communities, active ones exclude dead or
   dormant organisms. For what concerns Fungi, which are mostly filamentous
   microorganisms, the relationship between DNA-based (total) and RNA-based
   (active) communities is unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the
   consequences of performing metabarcoding on both soil and wood-extracted
   eDNA and eRNA to delineate molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs)
   and differentiate fungal communities according to the environment they
   originate from. DNA and RNA-based communities differed not only in their
   taxonomic composition, but also in the relative abundances of several
   functional guilds. From a taxonomic perspective, we showed that several
   higher taxa are globally more represented in either ``active{''} or
   ``total{''} microbial communities. We also observed that delineation of
   MOTUs based on their co-occurrence among DNA and RNA sequences
   highlighted differences between the studied habitats that were
   overlooked when all MOTUs were considered, including those identified
   exclusively by eDNA sequences. We conclude that metabarcoding on eRNA
   provides original functional information on the specific roles of
   several taxonomic or functional groups that would not have been revealed
   using eDNA alone.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire affects our planet's biogeochemistry both by burning biomass
   and by driving changes in ecological communities and landcover. Some
   plants and ecosystem types are threatened by increasing fire pressure
   while others respond positively to fire, growing in local and regional
   abundance when it occurs regularly. However, quantifying total ecosystem
   response to fire demands consideration of impacts not only on
   aboveground vegetation, but also on soil microbes like fungi, which
   influence decomposition and nutrient mineralization. If fire-resistant
   soil fungal communities co-occur with similarly adapted plants, these
   above- and belowground ecosystem components should shift and recover in
   relative synchrony after burning. If not, fire might decouple ecosystem
   processes governed by these different communities, affecting total
   functioning. Here, we use a natural experiment to test whether
   fire-dependent ecosystems host unique, fire-resistant fungal
   communities. We surveyed burned and unburned areas across two California
   ecosystem types with differing fire ecologies in the immediate aftermath
   of a wildfire, finding that the soil fungal communities of
   fire-dependent oak woodlands differ from those of neighbouring mixed
   evergreen forests. We discovered furthermore that the latter are more
   strongly altered compositionally by fire than the former, suggesting
   that differences in fungal community structure support divergent
   community responses to fire across ecosystems. Our results thus indicate
   that fire-dependent ecosystems may host fire-resistant fungal
   communities.}},

   These results reveal how tree species and their specific traits

Title = {{Revealing hidden drivers of macrofungal species richness by analyzing
   fungal guilds in temperate forests, West Hungary}},
Journal = {{COMMUNITY ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{We explored the most influential stand-scaled drivers of
   ectomycorrhizal, terricolous saprotrophic, and wood-inhabiting (main
   functional groups) macrofungal species richness in mixed forests by
   applying regression models. We tested 67 potential explanatory variables
   representing tree species composition, stand structure, soil and litter
   conditions, microclimate, landscape structure, and management history.
   Within the main functional groups, we formed and modeled guilds and used
   their drivers to more objectively interpret the drivers of the main
   functional groups. Terricolous saprotrophic fungi were supported by air
   humidity and litter mass. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were suppressed by high
   soil nitrogen content and high air temperature. Wood saprotrophs were
   enhanced by litter pH (deciduous habitats), deadwood cover, and beech
   proportion. Wood saprotrophic guilds were determined often by drivers
   with hidden effects on all wood saprotrophs: non-parasites: total
   deadwood cover; parasites: beech proportion; white rotters: litter pH;
   brown rotters: air temperature (negatively); endophytes: beech
   proportion; early ruderals: deciduous stands that were formerly meadows;
   combative invaders: deciduous tree taxa; heart rotters: coarse woody
   debris; late stage specialists: deciduous deadwood. Terricolous
   saprotrophic cord formers positively responded to litter mass. Studying
   the drivers of guilds simultaneously, beech was a keystone species to
   maintain fungal diversity in the region, and coniferous stands would be
   more diverse by introducing deciduous tree species. Guilds were
   determined by drivers different from each other underlining their
   different functional roles and segregated substrate preferences.
   Modeling guilds of fungal species with concordant response to the
   environment would be powerful to explore and understand the functioning
   of fungal communities.}},

   decomposition, belowground processes, biological invasion, and tree
   health are less common in all forest types. Further, most of the studies

Abstract = {{Understanding plant roots induced changes in soil organic matter (SOM)
   decomposition, the rhizosphere effect, is critical to predict soil
   carbon and nutrient cycling within and across biomes. Root functional
   traits are proposed to regulate the rhizosphere effect. We measured the
   rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition by incubating rhizosphere and
   bulk soils sampled from 14 hardwood species with distinct mycorrhizal
   associations (Arbuscular mycorrhizal, AM vs. Ectomycorrhizal, ECM). We
   also measured root traits (related to chemistry, morphology and
   physiology), soil enzymes related to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous
   cycling and soil physico-chemical properties, which could explain the
   mechanisms that regulate interspecific variation of the rhizosphere
   effect on SOM decomposition. There was large interspecific variation in
   the rhizosphere effects on SOM decomposition and soil enzymes, which was
   not influenced by mycorrhizal associations. Root traits were more
   strongly correlated with the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition
   across the 14 hardwood species than bulk soil physico-chemical
   properties. Specifically, the rhizosphere effect on SOM decomposition
   was correlated positively with root nitrogen concentration, and
   negatively with root carbon/nitrogen ratio and root diameter,
   respectively. These three root traits were the most important predictors
   for the interspecific variation of the rhizosphere effect on SOM
   decomposition amongst all measured variables. Moreover, the rhizosphere
   effect on SOM decomposition tended to increase with increasing root
   exudationn rates. This is compelling evidence that the rhizosphere
   effect on SOM decomposition tends to increase along the root economics
   spectrum from conservative species to acquisitive species in woody
   plants. Our findings thus contribute to a better mechanistic link
   between root traits and rhizosphere effect across species, which could
   be incorporated into land surface models to predict ecosystem scale
   consequences of root induced changes in SOM decomposition.}},

   had significantly lower (p < 0.01) OTU richness than both pine species
   stakes on the surface and in mineral soil. Although richness was not
   strongly affected, fungal community composition in the mineral soil was
   significantly altered by thinning treatments, wood stake species, and

   deciduous tree species depended to 46\% on the quality of litterfall and
   root inputs (N content, C:N, O:C ratio), and the initial isotopic
   signatures of litterfall. Hence, SOM composition and turnover also

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) deposition can enhance carbon (C) capture and storage in
   northern coniferous forests but it may also enhance the demand for
   phosphorus (P). While it is well established that long-term N enrichment
   can decrease decomposition and enhance the accumulation of C in soils,
   it remains uncertain if a higher demand and acquisition of P influence
   soil C.
   We studied microbial phosphorus mobilization and growth within a
   long-term N enrichment experiment in a Norway spruce forest, where N
   deposition was simulated by adding 0, 12.5 or 50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)
   for 21 years (n = 12), by incubating microbial ingrowth cores with
   needles and humus with low and high P content, and with sand with and
   without mineral apatite P.
   Long-term N enrichment had no effect on microbial P mobilization in
   needles and humus and did not enhance the positive effect that apatite
   had on fungal growth. However, it consistently strengthened the
   retention of C in the soil by decreasing decomposition of needle and
   humus, both with low and high P content, and by increasing fungal growth
   in sand-filled ingrowth cores. Furthermore, we did not find any evidence
   that higher microbial P mobilization in response to N enrichment
   affected soil C storage.
   These results show that long-term N enrichment in relatively young soils
   dominated by coniferous trees and ectomycorrhizal fungi can have
   relatively small impact on microbial P mobilization from organic sources
   and on the potential to mobilize P from minerals, and subsequently that
   elevated P demand due to N enrichment is unlikely to lead to a reduction
   in the soil C accumulation rate.

Abstract = {{The results of monitoring the biota of agaricoid basidiomycetes in
   spruce forests (riverbank spruce and wood sorrel spruce forest) in the
   subzone of the southern taiga of Perm krai for 40 years are summed up.
   To date, 336 species and intraspecific taxa of agaricoid basidiomycetes
   belonging to 73 genera and 16 families have been found in spruce
   forests. The species of the families Tricholomataceae, Cortinariaceae,
   and Russulaceae predominate, which is typical for the boreal zone of
   Eurasia. The largest number of species is found in the genera
   Cortinarius (43 species), Mycena (39), Russula (25), and Lactarius (13),
   which is typical of the southern taiga subzone. It is noted that the
   species composition of agaricoid basidiomycetes changes with time to a
   greater extent (Jacquard's coefficients (J x 100): riverbank spruce
   forest: J = 44-50; sorrel spruce forest: J = 43-47) than the species
   composition of higher vascular plants (J = 69-88). Many common features
   are revealed between the species composition of fungi of spruce forests
   (J = 49). Over the entire period of observations in spruce forests, 16
   species dominating in the number of basidiomas and 19-21 species
   dominating in the biomass of basidiomas have been identified. As a
   result of the analysis of the ecological-trophic structure of the

Abstract = {{Increased soil nitrogen (N) from atmospheric N deposition could change
   microbial communities and functions. However, the underlying mechanisms
   and whether soil phosphorus (P) status are responsible for these changes
   still have not been well explained. Here, we investigated the effects of
   N and P additions on soil bacterial and fungal communities and predicted
   their functional compositions in a temperate forest. We found that N
   addition significantly decreased soil bacterial diversity in the organic
   (O) horizon, but tended to increase bacterial diversity in the mineral
   (A) horizon soil. P addition alone did not significantly change soil
   bacterial diversity but mitigated the negative effect of N addition on
   bacterial diversity in the O horizon. Neither N addition nor P addition
   significantly influenced soil fungal diversity. Changes in soil
   microbial community composition under N and P additions were mainly due
   to the shifts in soil pH and NO3- contents. N addition can affect
   bacterial functional potentials, such as ureolysis, N fixation,
   respiration, decomposition of organic matter processes, and fungal
   guilds, such as pathogen, saprotroph, and mycorrhizal fungi, by which
   more C probably was lost in O horizon soil under increased N deposition.
   However, P addition can alleviate or switch the effects of increased N
   deposition on the microbial functional potentials in O horizon soil and
   may even be a benefit for more C sequestration in A horizon soil. Our
   results highlight the different responses of microorganisms to N and P
   additions between O and A horizons and provides an important insight for
   predicting the changes in forest C storage status under increasing N
   deposition in the future.}},

   fruiting-body production was monitored by counting their number and/or

   usually showed two abundance peaks in Kanazawa (Ishikawa), mid-summer

Abstract = {{Wildfire shapes the structure, dynamic and functioning of boreal
   forests. With predicted warmer and drier summers, increased incidence
   and intensity of crown-fires may affect plant-soil interactions with
   consequences for post-fire fertility and forest productivity.
   We assessed how severity of crown- and ground-fire in boreal pine
   forests affected post-fire responses of soil fungal communities and
   their associated enzyme activities, and how variation in fire severity
   interacts with salvage (post-fire) logging in impacting soil fungi.
   Crown fire-induced tree mortality had a stronger impact on fungal
   biomass and community composition than did ground-fire-induced loss of
   soil organic matter. Severe crown-fire led to replacement of
   ectomycorrhizal- and litter-associated fungi by stress-tolerant
   ascomycetes. Elevated activities of hydrolytic enzymes in burned areas
   were correlated with root-associated ascomycetes and moulds, suggesting
   opportunistic exploitation of labile organic substrates. Fire did not,
   however, increase the abundance of more potent basidiomycete decomposers
   in the organic layer, nor did it enhance organic matter oxidation by
   fungal peroxidases, indicating that the potential for major post-fire
   losses of carbon due to stimulated decomposition is limited. Rather,
   peroxidase activity was low in burned areas, likely reflecting the
   absence of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Post-fire salvage logging induced
   larger shifts in fungal communities in areas with low crown-fire
   severity.
   Synthesis. Historically, boreal pine forests have been shaped by
   low-severity ground-fires. Our study highlights a risk that increasing
   occurrence of high-severity crown-fire as climate warms will have
   detrimental effects on mycorrhizal-mediated functions that are pivotal
   for maintaining organic matter turnover, soil fertility and forest

Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{150}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Woody plant roots can be classified into absorptive roots and transport
   roots based on root functions, order and traits. While there is an
   emerging view that living roots actively affect soil organic carbon
   (SOC) decomposition via the rhizosphere priming effect (RPE), the
   linkages of the RPE with C allocation to absorptive roots (relative to
   total roots) and their functional traits across soils are virtually
   unknown. Here, we investigated the RPE by growing a tree species
   (Chinese fir, Cunninghamia lanceolata) in three isotopically-distinct
   C-4 soil types with different soil properties such as C/nitrogen (N)
   ratio and texture, and by growing three tree species (Chinese fir, larch
   (Larix kaempferi) and ash (Fraxinus mandshurica)) with wide variations
   in root functional traits in one of the C-4 soils. We classified living
   roots into absorptive roots (first and second orders) and transport
   roots (third and higher orders) and then quantified their C allocation
   (relative to total roots) and morphological and chemical traits
   associated with economic construction, rhizodeposition and resource
   acquisition. We found that the RPE of Chinese fir across the three soils
   decreased with an increase in soil C/N ratio. This result conflicted
   with the N mining hypothesis and suggests that soil C stabilization
   mechanisms associated with clay minerals may play an important role.
   Further, significant differences in the RPE among tree species were
   largely accounted for by the C allocation to absorptive roots. Moreover,
   there was a significantly negative relationship between specific surface
   area of absorptive roots and the specific RPE (per unit biomass of
   absorptive roots) among tree species, suggesting that absorptive root
   traits shaping the extent of the rhizosphere may regulate the RPE. Taken
   together, our results provide evidence that absorptive roots play a
   predominant role in causing the RPE. These findings present an important
   step toward improving our capability to predict plant effects on SOC
   decomposition through linking the RPE to absorptive root functional
   traits.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting changes in carbon and nutrient cycles in plantations requires
   a mechanistic understanding of the effects of stand age on soil quality
   and microbial communities. Here, we evaluated soil quality by using an
   integrated soil quality index (SQI) and traced the parallel shifts in
   fungal community composition using high-throughput sequencing in a
   chronosequence of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations
   (stand age of 3, 16, 25, 32, >80 years). Soil properties showed
   pronounced changes with stand age in the topsoil. Soil organic carbon
   (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and available phosphorus (AP) were 2.1, 1.9
   and 2.2 times higher, respectively, in the oldest stands than in the
   youngest stands. SQI of the top 5 cm increased logarithmically with
   stand age. Mycorrhizal fungi initially increased in younger stands, but
   then they were gradually replaced by saprotrophs in older stands due to
   larger litterfall. Strong positive correlations between saprotrophic
   fungi and key soil quality indicators, such as TN, AP and NH4+,
   confirmed that abundance of decomposers is tightly linked with higher
   soil quality. Mycorrhizal
   ordersThelephorales,SebacinalesandRussulalesincreased in abundance and
   raised the activity of acid phosphatase to mobilise limiting phosphorus
   from organic matter. Consequently, mycorrhizal fungi are especially
   relevant in younger stands to acquire nutrients to sustain tree
   productivity. In developed stands, however, saprotrophic fungi are
   crucial in recycling nutrients from the litter. Collectively, the
   increase of topsoil quality during the life cycle of Chinese fir
   plantations is closely linked with the observed transition of fungal
   communities from mycorrhizae to saprotrophs.}},

Title = {{Benefit or Liability? The Ectomycorrhizal Association May Undermine Tree
   Adaptations to Fire After Long-term Fire Exclusion}},
Journal = {{ECOSYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{Long-term fire exclusion may weaken ecosystem resistance to the return
   of fire. We investigated how a surface wildfire that occurred after
   several decades of fire exclusion affected a southern Appalachian forest
   transitioning from a fire-adapted to a fire-intolerant state. Tree
   traits associated with fire adaptation often co-occur with traits for
   nutrient conservation, including the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) association.
   In the absence of fire, the ECM association may facilitate the
   accumulation of organic matter, which becomes colonized by fine roots
   that then become vulnerable to consumption or damage by fire. Therefore,
   a deeper organic horizon might make stands of fire-adapted, ECM trees
   less resistant to a surface wildfire than stands of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM), fire-intolerant trees. To test this hypothesis, we
   established plots in stands that fall along a gradient of mycorrhizal
   tree relative abundance both inside and outside the perimeter of the
   2016 Rock Mountain wildfire. With increasing relative abundance of ECM
   trees, we found increasing organic horizon depth and mass and slower
   rates of decay, even for litter of ECM tree species. We calculated a
   major (73-83\%) reduction in fine root biomass and length in the organic
   horizon following the wildfire. Over three years post-fire, we observed
   a higher probability of crown decline, basal sprouting and aboveground
   biomass mortality with increasing abundance of ECM trees. We propose
   that the biogeochemistry of mycorrhizal associations can help explain
   why fire exclusion makes stands of fire-adapted trees less resistant to
   a surface wildfire than those with fire-intolerant trees.}},

   edaphic (11.8\%) and microbial properties (6.3\%). The response of soil

Abstract = {{Leaf litter decomposition is a fundamental process involved in soil
   carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Observational and experimental evidence
   suggests that leaf litter from arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree species

   decomposer microorganisms, but remains to be confirmed in subtropical

   decomposition rates of litter from AM and ECM subtropical trees. In the
   field, we conducted a fungal hyphal exclusion experiment beneath AM and
   ECM trees. We also used fungicides and bactericides to distinguish the
   contribution of bacteria and fungi to litter decomposition in a
   shade-house experiment. Fungi were responsible more leaf litter decay in
   soil around AM trees than in soil around ECM trees. When fungi were
   excluded, AM and ECM litters with similar chemical properties decomposed
   at the same rate, but the AM litters decayed more quickly when
   saprotrophic fungi were present. Soil around AM trees had more abundance
   of saprotrophic fungi and greater N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid

Abstract = {{Recent studies have revealed effects of various tree species on soil
   physical and chemical properties. However, effects of various tree
   species on composition and activity of soil microbiota and the relevant
   controls remain poorly understood. We evaluated the influence of tree
   species associated with two different mycorrhizal types, ectomycorrhiza
   (EcM) and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), on growth, biomass and metabolic
   activity of soil fungal and bacterial communities using common garden
   tree species experiments throughout Denmark. The soil microbial
   communities differed between six European tree species as well as
   between EcM (beech, lime, oak and spruce) and AM (ash and maple) tree
   species. The EcM tree species had higher fungal biomass, fungal growth
   and bacterial biomass, while AM species showed higher bacterial growth.
   The results indicated that microbial community composition and
   functioning differed between groups of tree species with distinct litter
   qualities that generate soil C/N ratio and soil pH differences. The
   mycorrhizal association only partly explained litter quality and soil
   microbial species differences since lime was more similar to AM tree
   species. In addition, our results indicated that tree species-mediated
   soil pH and C/N ratio were the most important variables shaping
   microbial communities with a positive effect on bacterial and a negative
   effect on fungal growth rates. The results suggest that tree
   species-mediated microbial community composition and activity may be
   important drivers of the different vertical soil C distribution

Abstract = {{The interactions of fungal guilds have recently been proposed as drivers
   of organic matter transformation in forest soils. We conducted a pot
   experiment with Norway spruce seedlings planted in spruce needle litter
   inoculated with several fungal strains belonging to different ecological
   guilds (saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, and root endophytic) to assess how
   the fungi and their interactions affect the transformation of humic
   substances (HS) and phosphorus (P) in the litter. Several methods for
   the characterization of P forms and HS were employed, including P-31
   NMR, UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy.
   Our results show that fungal interactions influence not only the flow of
   P in decaying (plant) litter but also the transformation of the soil
   organic matter itself. Pots with saprotrophic Gymnopus androsaceus
   generally retained more P and prevented the accumulation of phosphonates
   caused by mycorrhizal Hyaloscypha finlandica, highlighting the strong
   competitive ability of the former species. The increased mineralization
   of P caused by G. androsaceus was not observed in the combined
   treatments, suggesting that other present fungi took up part of the
   inorganic P. The tested fungi did not affect the amount of HS produced
   but changed the characteristics of the HS. Mycorrhizal H. finlandica and
   root endophytic Phialocephala fortinii increased the relative proportion
   of carboxylic moieties in the HS regardless of the presence or absence
   of G. androsaceus, probably via the production and incorporation of
   melanins. The UV-Vis absorbance characteristics of the HS were
   significantly influenced by fungal interactions. Mycorrhizal H.
   finlandica and Hebeloma bryogenes retarded humification, as determined
   by the A4/6 ratio. We attribute the similar shift observed in Serpula
   himantoides to the partial oxidative degradation of HS.
   Our study shows that fungal root endophytes can significantly contribute
   to litter transformation along with mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi.
   The extent and patterns of the transformation seem to be
   species-dependent in all studied fungal groups.}},

Title = {{Impacts of forest thinning on soil microbial community structure and
   extracellular enzyme activities: A global meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{149}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Thinning profoundly affects soil microbial communities and carbon (C)
   cycling through altering soil microclimate, plant growth, C inputs and
   allocations. However, these effects are uncertain and may change with
   thinning intensity, recovery stage, forest type, and climate. Here, we
   conducted a global meta-analysis, based on 337 observations from 49
   studies, to quantify the responses of soil properties, microbial biomass
   and community structure, and extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) to
   thinning. We found that thinning did not change the total microbial
   biomass, but significantly shifted the soil microbial community
   structure and EEAs. Thinning stimulated both C-oxidase and C-hydrolase,
   but decreased the ratio of oligotrophic to copiotrophic microbes (i.e.
   fungi to bacteria ratio and Gram-positive bacteria to Gram-negative
   bacteria ratio) in the early recovery stage. In contrast, in the mid
   recovery stage, thinning enhanced C-oxidase but reduced C-hydrolase, and
   increased the ratio of oligotrophic to copiotrophic microbes. In the
   late recovery stage, neither community structure nor EEAs differed
   significantly between thinned and control stands. Such recovery dynamics
   reflect shifts of the resource-utilization strategies of microbes that
   are associated with community reorganization. Besides, the distinct
   litter quality between coniferous and broadleaf forests explained their
   different microbial responses. Overall, the current meta-analysis
   suggested that microbes can adapt the thinning-induced biotic and
   abiotic changes by adjustment of community structure rather than their
   biomass. The global patterns of how soil microbial community structure
   and EEAs respond to thinning deepen the understanding of the mechanisms
   underlying the thinning impacts on the soil C cycling.}},

Title = {{Are the rhizosphere fungal communities of Nothofagus alpina established
   in two different environments influenced by plant genetic diversity?}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{473}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Fungi are one of the most important soil microorganisms due to their
   abundance and the importance of the ecosystem processes they carry out,
   like decomposition, nutrient cycling, and the establishment of
   biological interactions such as mycorrhizas. Fungi can be used as
   bioindicators because they are highly sensitive to alterations in their
   surroundings, thus being useful for monitoring ecological changes and
   effects of human activity on natural ecosystems. Nothofagus alpina
   (raule is an ecologically and economically important species of South
   American temperate forests. It is currently included in domestication
   and conservation programs, and provenance trials have been installed in
   different ecosystems of Patagonia. These trials are ideal for studying
   how tree genetics might influence the associated microbiota.
   Afforestation with fast-growing exotic conifers (mainly Pinus ponderosa)
   had been promoted as an important economic activity in Patagonia, but
   nowadays there is an increasing interest for the establishment of mix
   Pinus + Nothofagus plantations instead of monospecific Pinus stands and
   for using Pinus plantations as refugee for assisted Nothofagus
   migration. The main objective of this work was to explore the structure
   of different fungal communities in the rhizosphere of N. alpina with
   different genetic diversity (high, intermediate, and low) implanted
   under a native Nothofagus forest and a P. ponderosa plantation.
   Fingerprinting based on Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis
   revealed differences in the structure of the rhizosphere fungal
   communities. Some relationships between N. alpina genetic diversity and
   composition of rhizosphere fungal communities were observed. In the
   native forest, one of the provenances (intermediate genetic diversity)
   was associated with the highest richness of Basidiomycetes and total
   fungi. In addition, individual genetic parameters of N. alpina specimens
   implanted in the native forest significantly correlated with Ascomycetes
   richness. It was also found that Basidiomycetes were the dominating
   fungal taxa in the native forest, and Ascomycetes in the P. ponderosa
   plantation. Factors as soil physicochemical characteristics and the
   dominant forestry species, which provide different quantity and quality
   of litter inputs and are associated with different ectomycorrhizal
   fungi, seemed to be the main factors determining this significant
   difference between the native forest and the plantation. Beyond
   highlighting the potential of applying soil fungi as bioindicators, our
   study contributes to understanding the relationship between host
   genetics and rhizosphere fungi. This information is relevant not only
   for conservation and restoration programs, but also for taking
   management decisions related with sustainable forestry and domestication
   of native tree species.}},

Volume = {{473}},

Abstract = {{While growing evidence has shown the shift in terrestrial ecosystems
   from nitrogen (N) limitation to phosphorous (P) limitation under
   increasing N deposition, it is poorly understood how plants adapt to
   this P limitation. Here, we examined which strategies would be adopted
   by plants for alleviating P deficiency caused by N enrichment from the
   perspective of aboveground conservation and belowground uptake. To
   achieve this objective, we conducted a five-year N-addition experiment
   (0 and 50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) in a 60-year-old larch (Larbc kaempferi)
   plantation, and measured variables related to ecosystem P status, leaf P
   resorption, soil exploration by roots and extraradical hyphae of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi, and rhizosphere effects on soil P cycling. We
   found that N addition significantly reduced soil available P
   concentration and enhanced leaf N:P ratio, indicating the increasing
   degree of P deficiency under N addition. Leaf P resorption efficiency
   and proficiency were significantly enhanced by N addition, implying the
   increase in aboveground P conservation. Moreover, N addition
   significantly increased root length density and decreased
   ectomycorrhizal extraradical hypha biomass, suggesting the enhanced role
   of the root pathway in scavenging soil P. Rhizosphere effects on
   phosphatase activity were significantly enhanced by N addition,
   indicating the improved capacity of mining P from organic P forms.
   Collectively, our findings highlight that the larch could concurrently
   improve aboveground P conservation and belowground P uptake to alleviate
   P deficiency induced by N addition, and suggest that adjustments in
   resource allocation associated with these adaptive strategies could have
   significant consequences on ecosystem functions.}},

Title = {{Radiocarbon evidence of the impact of forest-to-plantation conversion on
   soil organic carbon dynamics on a tropical island}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{375}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Tropical soils are critical terrestrial carbon reservoirs with abundant
   biodiversity that respond rapidly to environmental change. Globally, the
   expanding conversion of natural tropical forest to plantations in recent
   decades, to meet economic demands, has markedly influenced the cycling
   of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools; however, the mechanisms underlying
   the changes in SOC dynamics are poorly understood. In this study, we
   examined the SOC dynamics and soil microbial communities at five
   adjacent tropical forest sites characterized by different logging and
   plantation practices over the past few decades on Hainan Island, China,
   by applying natural abundance radiocarbon (C-14) and phospholipid fatty
   acid (PLFA) analysis. At a > 35-year rubber plantation site and a >
   50-year eucalyptus plantation site, an abnormal up-profile decrease in
   radiocarbon abundance was observed in the upper 30 cm soil layer. This
   could be indicative of continued soil organic matter decomposition long
   after forest-plantation conversion, and was consistent with the SOC
   inventories in the upper 30 cm soil layer at the two sites being
   significantly lower than those of NF. Both the SOC apparent radiocarbon
   ages and SOC inventory at a eucalyptus plantation site in which tillage
   was stopped 20 years ago were similar to those of NF, indicating that a
   recovery process had occurred. The soil microbial biomass was generally
   lower at the plantation sites than at the NF site. Both the radiocarbon
   abundance and SOC inventories in the upper 30 cm soil layer showed
   positive correlations with the soil microbial biomass, suggesting that
   microbes may have played a key role in the fate of SOC. This study
   provided evidence that forest-plantation conversion may facilitate the
   dissimilation of SOC, and also demonstrated that radiocarbon can serve
   as a powerful tool for assessing the potential changes of soil carbon
   dynamics resulting from forest-to-plantation conversion.}},

Title = {{Long-Term Impact of Liming on Soil C and N in a Fertile Spruce Forest
   Ecosystem}},
Journal = {{ECOSYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{Liming can counteract acidification in forest soils, but the effects on
   soil C and N pools and fluxes over long periods are less well
   understood. Replicated plots in an acidic and N-rich 40-year-old Norway
   spruce (Picea abies) forest in SW Sweden (Hasslov) were treated with 0,
   3.45 and 8.75 Mg ha(-1)of dolomitic lime (D0, D2 and D3) in 1984.
   Between 1984 and 2016, soil organic C to 30 cm depth increased by 28 Mg
   ha(-1)(30\% increase) in D0 and decreased by 9 Mg ha(-1)(9.4\% decrease)
   in D3. The change in D2 was not significant (+ 2 Mg ha(-1)). Soil N
   pools changed proportionally to those in soil C pools. The C and N
   changes occurred almost exclusively in the top organic layer.
   Non-burrowing earthworms responded positively to liming and stimulated
   heterotrophic respiration in this layer in both D2 and D3. Burrowing
   earthworms in D3 further accelerated C and N turnover and loss of soil.
   The high soil C and N loss at our relatively N-rich site differs from
   studies of N-poor sites showing no C and N loss. Earthworms need both
   high pH and N-rich food to reach high abundance and biomass. This can
   explain why liming of N-rich soils often results in decreasing C and N
   pools, whereas liming of N-poor soils with few earthworms will not show
   any change in soil C and N. Extractable nitrate N was always higher in
   D3 than in D2 and D0. After 6 years (1990), potential nitrification was
   much higher in D3 (197 kg N ha(-1)) than in D0 (36 kg N ha(-1)), but
   this difference decreased during the following years, when also the
   unlimed organic layers showed high nitrification potential. Our
   experiment finds that high-dose liming of acidic N-rich forest soils
   produces an initial pulse of soil heterotrophic respiration and
   increases in earthworm biomass, which together cause long-term declines
   in soil C and N pools.}},

Abstract = {{The negative effects of deforestation can potentially be ameliorated
   through ecological restoration. However, reforestation alone may not
   reassemble the same ecological communities or functions as primary
   forests. In part, this failure may be owed to forest ecosystems
   inherently involving complex interactions among guilds of organisms.
   Plants, which structure forest food webs, rely on intimate associations
   with symbiotic microbes such as root-inhabiting mycorrhizal fungi. Here,
   we leverage a large-scale reforestation project on Hawai'i Island
   underway for over three decades to assess whether arbuscular mycorrhizal
   (AM) fungal communities have concurrently been restored. The reference
   ecosystem for this restoration project is a remnant montane native
   Hawaiian forest that provides critical habitat for endangered birds. We
   sampled soils from 12 plots within remnant and restored forest patches
   and characterized AM fungal communities using high-throughput amplicon
   sequencing. While some AM fungal community metrics were comparable
   between remnant and restored forest (e.g. species richness), other key
   characteristics were not. Specifically, community membership and the
   identity of AM fungal keystone species differed between the two habitat
   types, as well as the primary environmental factors influencing
   community composition. Remnant forest AM fungal communities were
   strongly associated with soil chemical properties, especially pH, while
   restored forest communities were influenced by the spatial proximity to
   remnant forests. We posit that combined, these differences in soil AM
   fungal communities could be negatively affecting the recruitment of
   native plant hosts and that future restoration efforts should consider
   plant-microbe interactions as an important facet of forest health.}},

Abstract = {{Cistus ladanifer scrublands are widely distributed in the Mediterranean

   did not affect overall fungal community composition nor fungal

   fungal (chitin, beta-1,3-glucan, and beta-1,3-1,6-glucan) biomass along

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2270-2282}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1 The abundance of fine roots and leaves in forests typically peaks
   during mid-succession and then declines. If fine root area declines more
   rapidly than leaf area, this could contribute disproportionately to
   stand decline. However, trees also partner with symbiotic
   ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi that facilitate nutrient acquisition of fine
   roots. Ectomycorrhizal fungi can use the carbohydrates provided by their
   plant partners to produce emanating fungal tissues which increase soil
   exploration potential but may also prove costly. We suggest two
   competing hypotheses to frame the response of ectomycorrhizas to stand
   age: (a) the `functional offset' hypothesis posits that the abundance of
   ectomycorrhizas with emanating tissues ('Distance' mycorrhizas)
   increases with stand age and (b) the `energy-limited' hypothesis posits
   that carbon available for root symbionts decreases with stand age
   resulting in fewer Distance mycorrhizas. In the first hypothesis, EcM
   functional traits offset root abundance, while in the second, traits
   parallel root abundance.
   2. To test these competing hypotheses, we sampled fine roots to a depth
   of 90 cm and used allometric equations to estimate changes in root and
   leaf area index across a chronosequence ofPinus banksianastands ranging
   from 2 to 76 years average tree age. We also examined fine roots
   microscopically to track changes in the abundance of EcM functional
   types. We used DNA-based methods to sequence EcM fungi and confirm roots
   were of P. banksiana.
   3. Both fine root and leaf area of pine increased for the first 30-36
   years (until Mid age) and then plateaued, while the ratio of leaf to
   fine root area was similar across the age gradient. Also, changes to
   fine root area with stand age depended on soil depth. The abundance of
   Distance mycorrhizas was lowest at the youngest plots and increased
   until Mid age, where it peaked, contrary to the functional offset
   hypothesis. Instead, the abundance of Distance mycorrhizas paralleled
   changes to leaf area, aligned with the energy-limited hypothesis.
   4. Synthesis. Ectomycorrhizas do not offset the function of roots,
   rather shifts in exploration type likely reflect adjustments to carbon
   supply from hosts.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in global temperatures due to climate change threaten to tip
   the balance between carbon (C) fluxes, liberating large amounts of C
   from soils. Evidence of warming-induced increases in CO2 efflux from
   soils has led to suggestions that this response of soil respiration
   (R-S) will trigger a positive land C-climate feedback cycle, ultimately
   warming the Earth further. Currently, there is little consensus about
   the mechanisms driving the warming-induced R-S response, and there are
   relatively few studies from ecosystems with large soil C stores. Here,
   we investigate the impacts of experimental warming on R-S in the C-rich
   soils of a Tasmanian grassy sedgeland and whether alterations of plant
   community composition or differences in microbial respiratory potential
   could contribute to any effects. In situ, warming increased RS on
   average by 28 \%, and this effect was consistent over time and across
   plant community composition treatments. In contrast, warming had no
   impact on microbial respiration in incubation experiments. Plant
   community composition manipulations did not influence R-S or the R-S
   response to warming. Processes driving the R-S response in this
   experiment were, therefore, not due to plant community effects and are
   more likely due to increases in belowground autotrophic respiration and
   the supply of labile substrate through rhizodeposition and root
   exudates. CO2 efflux from this high-C soil increased by more than a
   quarter in response to warming, suggesting inputs need to increase by at
   least this amount if soil C stocks are to be maintained. These results
   indicate the need for comprehensive investigations of both C inputs and
   losses from C-rich soils if efforts to model net ecosystem C exchange of
   these crucial, C-dense systems are to be successful.}},

Abstract = {{Root exudation stimulates microbial decomposition and enhances nutrient
   availability to plants. It remains difficult to measure and predict this
   carbon flux in natural conditions, especially for mature woody plants.
   Based on a known conceptual framework of root functional traits
   coordination, we proposed that root functional traits may predict root
   exudation. We measured root exudation and other seven root
   morphological/chemical/physiological traits for 18 coexisting woody
   species in a deciduous-evergreen mixed forest in subtropical China. Root
   exudation, respiration, diameter and nitrogen (N) concentration all
   exhibited significant phylogenetic signals. We found that root exudation
   positively correlated with competitive traits (root respiration, N
   concentration) and negatively with a conservative trait (root tissue
   density). Furthermore, these relationships were independent of
   phylogenetic signals. A principal component analysis showed that root
   exudation and morphological traits loaded on two perpendicular axes.
   Root exudation is a competitive trait in a multidimensional fine-root
   functional coordination. The metabolic dimension on which root exudation
   loaded was relatively independent of the morphological dimension,
   indicating that increasing nutrient availability by root exudation might
   be a complementary strategy for plant nutrient acquisition. The positive
   relationship between root exudation and root respiration and N
   concentration is a promising approach for the future prediction of root
   exudation.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of environmental variables on soil
   fungal communities under different vegetation types in order to advance
   our understanding of soil fungal community assembly associated with
   restored vegetation and under different climate conditions. Three
   vegetation types (no grazing and logging in grasslands and forests, and
   planted herbs and small shrubs in bare land in the desert) on the Loess
   Plateau in China were chosen as subjects, and pyrosequencing of the 18S
   rRNA gene region was used to analyze the changes in the diversity and
   community composition of soil fungi. Vegetation type had significant
   effects on soil fungal diversity. The forest and grassland soils had
   similar fungal diversity levels, which were significantly higher than
   that of the desert ecosystem. Multiple regression models indicated that
   total phosphorus in soil and the ratio of soil organic carbon to total
   nitrogen in soil (C:N) were the best predictors of soil fungal
   diversity. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the most dominant phyla in
   all soils, accounting for 83.6 \% of fungal sequences. Dothideomycetes
   (26.6 \%), Sordariomycetes (18.3 \%), Eurotiomycetes (8.5 \%),
   Pezizomycetes (12.1 \%) and Dothideomycetes (10.7 \%) were the dominant
   classes across the three vegetation types. Agaricomycetes and
   Sordariomycetes were more dominant in forest soils than grasslands and
   desert soils, while Pezizomycetes were more frequently observed in
   desert soils. Along an increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP)
   gradient, relative abundance of the Ascomycota phylum decreased and that
   of the Basidiomycota increased. Among local environmental factors, MAP,
   soil pH and soil organic matter were the main factors influencing the
   soil fungal community composition, explaining 20.9 \%, 15.9 \% and 10.4
   \% of the variation in the fungal community, respectively. Considering
   geographic distance, variation partitioning revealed that geographic
   distance explained more of the fungal community variation than measured
   environmental factors. This finding may help to predict the consequences
   in fungal communities in response to climate change and vegetation
   restoration in arid areas.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Deforestation of tropical peat swamp forests is rapidly taking place
   across Southeast Asia to make way for agricultural expansion. Within
   forest ecosystems, macrofungi play a vital role, including wood
   decomposition and nutrient cycles. To reveal the effects of
   deforestation and land cover conversion on macrofungi in Southeast Asian
   tropical forests we assessed the relationship between environmental
   variables such as air temperature, relative air humidity, soil pH, soil
   moisture, canopy cover, canopy closure, habitat type (i.e., peat swamp
   forest, large-scale plantation, monoculture smallholding, and
   polyculture smallholding) and available substrata with macrofungal
   species richness and abundance. We sample macrofungi across four
   habitats on Peninsula Malaysia including peat swamp forest, large-scale
   plantations, monoculture smallholding and polyculture smallholding. We
   found that substrate richness had a positive effect on macrofungal
   morphospecies richness, while soil pH and air temperature had a negative
   effect. For macrofungal abundance, canopy closure and soil moisture had
   negative effects, whereas substrate richness and relative air humidity
   had positive effects. Our data showed considerable variation in
   functional group responses to environmental variables. The abundance of
   wood-inhabiting fungi was driven primarily by substrate richness, while
   relative air humidity, soil moisture, and habitat type play minor roles.
   The abundance of terricolous saprotrophic fungi was determined
   principally by habitat type, substrate richness, and relative air
   humidity. Macrofungal community structure was mainly influenced by
   substrate richness, followed by microclimates and soil characteristics.
   Our results can provides critical ecological data to support
   conservation stakeholders conserve macrofungi in natural and
   agricultural peatlands. Our study suggests that the expansion of oil
   palm monocultures, to the detriment of peat swamp forests, is likely to
   have negative effects on macrofungal biodiversity and further
   agricultural expansion should be prevented. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Tree-killing forest disturbances such as storms and bark beetle
   outbreaks can lead to notable changes in the carbon (C) balance and

   in 2010 followed by an outbreak of European spruce bark beetle (Ips
   typographus L.) on tree, litter and soil C stocks as well as humus layer
   C fractions and microbial community composition were examined in boreal
   Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) stands. Tree (aboveground), litter
   detritus (distinguishable twig, bark and cones) and soil (humus layer
   and 0-6 cm mineral soil) C stocks were quantified for undisturbed
   (living trees), storm disturbed (in 2010) and I. typographus disturbed
   (tree mortality in circa 2013-2014) plots in 2015-2016. Additional humus
   layer samples were collected in 2017 for determination of total
   microbial biomass C, ergosterol (fungal biomass indicator) and K2SO4
   extractable (labile) C concentrations, as well as fungal and bacterial
   community composition (DNA sequencing). Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal
   mycelial growth in topsoil was also quantified. In spite of the
   differing initial development and intensity of the two disturbance
   types, there was little difference in humus layer C and microbiology
   between the storm and bark beetle disturbed plot types at the time of
   the study. This may be due to the longer time since the disturbance at
   the storm disturbed plots. The shift from tree biomass to necromass C
   stocks was not reflected in differences in SOC stocks or humus layer
   extractable C concentrations between undisturbed and disturbed plot
   types, but the amount of litter detritus on forest floor was similar
   (storm) or higher (beetle) in disturbed plots in comparison to
   undisturbed ones. Humus layer microbial biomass C and ergosterol
   concentrations and ECM fungal abundance were lower on disturbed plots in
   comparison to undisturbed plots. The disturbed plots were also indicated
   to have a slightly higher abundance of some saprotrophic fungi.
   Differences in the effects of the two disturbance types may occur when
   studied at differing spatial scales and at different times after
   disturbance. To understand the full impact of such disturbances on
   forest functioning and C balance, long-term monitoring studies will be
   required.}},

Abstract = {{Forest soils represent important terrestrial carbon (C) pools, where C
   is primarily fixed in plant biomass and then is incorporated in the
   biomass of fungi and bacteria. Although classical concepts assume that
   fungi are the main decomposers of the recalcitrant organic matter within
   plant and microbial biomass, whereas bacteria are considered to mostly
   utilize simpler compounds, recent studies have shown that fungi and
   bacteria overlap in substrate utilization. Here, we studied the
   microbial contribution to the recycling of dead biomass by analyzing the
   bacterial and fungal communities in soil microcosms supplemented with
   C-13-labeled biomass of plant, fungal, and bacterial origin using a
   combination of DNA-stable isotope probing and metagenomics. Both fungi
   and bacteria contributed actively to the degradation of complex
   components of plant and microbial biomass. Specific families of
   carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme) were involved in the degradation of
   each biomass type. Moreover, the analysis of five bacterial
   metagenome-assembled genomes indicated the key role of some bacterial
   genera in the degradation of plant biomass (Cytophaga and Asticcacaulis)
   and microbial biomass (Herminiimonas). The enzymatic systems utilized by

Abstract = {{Traits are critical in predicting decomposition that fuels carbon and

   associated with either arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal
   (ECM) fungi in temperate and subtropical forests in China.
   Carbon-related traits (acid-unhydrolysable residue (AUR) and cellulose
   concentrations) had predominant control of root decomposition in AM
   species while nutrient-related traits (magnesium concentration)
   predominately controlled that in ECM species. Thicker absorptive roots
   decomposed faster in AM species as a result of their lower AUR
   concentrations, but more slowly in ECM angiosperm species potentially as
   a result of their higher magnesium concentrations. Root decomposition
   was linked to root nutrient economy in both forests while root
   diameter-decomposition coordination emerged only in the subtropical
   forest where root diameter and decomposition presented similar
   cross-species variations. Our findings suggest that root
   trait-decomposition linkages differ strongly with mycorrhizal type and

   opposing directions and with contrasting mechanisms for AM and ECM

   carbon in amino acids (AAs) and bulk tissue of leaf litter, fungi and
   fungal-feeding Diptera larvae. By accounting for isotopic variability of
   utilized substrates, compound-specific isotope analyses of nitrogen in
   AAs yielded more realistic results for the trophic position of fungi

   different AA delta C-13 signatures separating fungal functional groups
   and their consumers in fingerprinting approaches, thereby allowing to
   trace energy fluxes from these basal resources to higher trophic levels.
   A pronounced isotopic fractionation even in essential/source AAs of

Abstract = {{Mean annual temperature (MAT) is an influential climate factor affecting
   the bioavailability of growth-limiting nutrients nitrogen (N) and
   phosphorus (P). In tropical montane wet forests, warmer MAT drives
   higher N bioavailability, while patterns of P availability are
   inconsistent across MAT. Two important nutrient acquisition strategies,
   fine root proliferation into bulk soil and root association with
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, are dependent on C availability to the
   plant via primary production. The case study presented here tests
   whether variation in bulk soil N bioavailability across a tropical
   montane wet forest elevation gradient (5.2 degrees C MAT range)
   influences (a) morphology fine root proliferation into soil patches with
   elevated N, P, and N+P relative to background soil and (b) arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonization of fine roots in patches. We
   created a fully factorial fertilized root ingrowth core design (N, P,
   N+P, unfertilized control) representing soil patches with elevated N and
   P bioavailability relative to background bulk soil. Our results show
   that percent AMF colonization of roots increased with MAT (r(2) = .19,p
   = .004), but did not respond to fertilization treatments. Fine root
   length (FRL), a proxy for root foraging, increased with MAT in
   N+P-fertilized patches only (p = .02), while other fine root
   morphological parameters did not respond to the gradient or fertilized
   patches. We conclude that in N-rich, fine root elongation into areas
   with elevated N and P declines while AMF abundance increases with MAT.
   These results indicate a tradeoff between P acquisition strategies
   occurring with changing N bioavailability, which may be influenced by
   higher C availability with warmer MAT.}},

Title = {{Contrasting Responses of Rhizosphere Bacteria, Fungi and Arbuscular

   Forest of China}},

Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Elevational gradients strongly affect microbial biodiversity in bulk
   soil through altering plant and soil properties, but the effects on
   rhizosphere microbial patterns remain unclear, especially at large
   spatial scales. We therefore designed an elevational gradient experiment
   to examine rhizosphere microbial (bacteria, fungi and arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi) diversity and composition using Illumina sequencing
   of the 16S rRNA and ITS genes for comparison to plant and soil
   properties. Our results showed that bacterial and fungal alpha diversity
   was significantly higher at mid-elevation, while AMF alpha diversity
   decreased monotonically. The beta diversities of the three groups were
   significantly affected by elevational gradients, but the effect on
   bacterial beta diversity was larger than on fungal and AMF beta
   diversity.Proteobacteria, the dominant phyla of bacteria, was
   significantly higher at the mid-elevation,
   whileAcidobacteriaandActinobacteriasignificantly decreased as elevation
   increased. The main fungal taxa,Basidiomycota, significantly decreased
   with elevation, andAscomycotasignificantly increased with
   elevation.Glomeromycota, the dominant AMF phyla, responded
   insignificantly to the elevational gradients. The responses of bacterial
   and fungal alpha diversity were mostly associated with tree diversity
   and organic carbon, whereas AMF alpha diversity mainly depended on
   litter N and P. Changes in bacterial community composition along the
   elevational gradient were explained primarily by litter N and P, and
   litter P was the main driver of fungal and AMF community composition.
   Overall, our results suggest that plant litter, particularly litter N
   and P, were the main source of external carbon input and drove the
   observed differences in rhizosphere microbial diversity and community
   composition. Our results highlight the importance of litter nutrition in
   structuring rhizosphere microbial communities in mountain ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Hundreds of Proteaceae species in Australia and South Africa typically
   grow on phosphorus (P)-impoverished soils, exhibiting a
   carboxylate-releasing P-mobilizing strategy. In the Southwest Australian
   Biodiversity Hotspot, twoXylomelum(Proteaceae) species are widely

   bulk soil were collected in natural habitats. Xylomelum occidentaledid
   not produce functional cluster roots and occupied soils that are
   somewhat less P-impoverished than those in typical Proteaceae habitats

   Xylomelum occidentaleuses a strategy that differs fundamentally from
   that typical in Proteaceae, accessing soil organic P without

   also in co-occurring non-Proteaceae that lack a carboxylate-exuding
   strategy. These co-occurring species are unlikely to benefit from
   mycorrhizal associations, because plant-available soil P concentrations
   are too low. Synthesis. Our findings show the first field evidence of

Title = {{Depth patterns and connections between gross nitrogen cycling and soil
   exoenzyme activities in three northern hardwood forests}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{147}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Despite the enormous size of the organic nitrogen (N) pool contained in
   mineral subsoils, rates of N cycling and soil exoenzyme activities are
   rarely measured in soils below 10 or 20 cm depth. Furthermore, assumed
   relationships between N mineralization rates and the activities of
   various decomposition exoenzymes are poorly characterized. We measured
   rates of gross and net N mineralization and nitrification as well as the
   potential activities of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes at five soil
   depths (forest floor to 50 cm) in Spodosols at three hardwood forests of
   varying age (45 and 100 years post-harvest and old growth) at and near
   the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA. As
   expected, rates of N cycling and potential enzyme activities per unit
   soil mass correlated strongly with soil carbon (C) concentration, and
   these parameters declined exponentially with increasing soil depth.
   After normalization per unit soil organic matter, N cycling rates and
   specific enzyme activities generally decreased little with depth within
   the mineral soil. Gross N mineralization rates correlated with specific
   activities of those enzymes that hydrolyze cellulose (beta-glucosidase,
   cellobiohydrolase) and N-rich glucosamine polymers
   (N-acetylglucosaminidase), but not those that degrade protein or more
   complex C compounds. Hence, gross N cycling appear associated with the N
   released during microbial N recycling, rather than from decomposition of
   soil organic matter. Across the three stands, the youngest had a larger
   ratio of N- to-phosphorus-acquiring enzyme activities, indicating a
   greater N demand in younger than older forests. For all three stands,
   mineral soil below 10 cm contributed 30-53\% of total gross and net N
   cycling per unit area to 50 cm depth. Overall, even though microbial N
   cycling and enzyme activities per unit soil mass decreased with depth,
   microbial processes in subsoils contributed substantially to
   ecosystem-scale gross N fluxes because of the sustained microbial
   activity per unit soil organic matter at depth and the large size of the
   organic matter pool in the mineral soil. These results support the
   inclusion of often-ignored mineral subsoils and microbial N recycling in
   both ecosystem N budgets and in model simulations, due to their
   contribution to soil N fluxes and the importance of microbial N dynamics
   in forest stands.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known of how hurricane-induced deposition of canopy material
   onto tropical forest floors influences the soil microbial communities
   involved in decomposition of these materials. In this study, to identify
   how soil bacterial and fungal communities might change after a
   hurricane, and their possible roles in the C and N cycles, soils were
   collected from five 2000 m(2)permanent plots in Lowland, Upland and
   Riparian primary forests in Costa Rica 3 months before and 7 months
   after Hurricane Otto damaged the forests. The soil Water, inorganic N
   and Biomass C increased and total organic C decreased Post-Hurricane,
   all of which best predicted the changes in the Post-Hurricane soil
   microbial communities. Post-Hurricane soils from all forest types showed
   significant changes in community composition of total bacteria, total
   fungi, and five functional groups of microbes (i.e., degrading/lignin
   degrading, NH4+-producing, and ammonium oxidizing bacteria, and the
   complex C degrading/wood rot/lignin degrading and ectomycorrhizal
   fungi), along with a decrease in richness in genera of all groups. As
   well, the mean proportion of DNA sequences (MPS) of all five functional
   groups increased. There were also significant changes in the MPS values
   of 7 different fungal and 7 different bacterial genera that were part of
   these functional groups. This is the first evidence that
   hurricane-induced deposition of canopy material is stimulating changes
   in the soil microbial communities after the hurricane, involving changes
   in specific taxonomic and functional group genera, and reduction in the
   community richness while selecting for dominant genera possibly better
   suited to process the canopy material. These changes may represent
   examples of taxonomic switching of functionally redundant microbial
   genera in response to dramatic changes in resource input. It is possible
   that differences in these microbial communities and genera may serve as
   indicators of disturbed and recovering regional soil ecosystems, and
   should be evaluated in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) deposition is a key factor that affects terrestrial
   biogeochemical cycles with a growing trend, especially in the southeast
   region of China, where shortage of available phosphorus (P) is
   particularly acute and P has become a major factor limiting plant growth
   and productivity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) establish a
   mutualistic symbiosis with plants, and play an important role in
   enhancing plant stress resistance. However, the response of AMF to the
   combined effects of N deposition and P additions is poorly understood.
   Thus, in this study, a field experiment was conducted in 10-year Chinese
   fir forests to estimate the effects of simulated nitrogen (N) deposition
   (low-N, 30 kg ha(-1) year(-1) and high-N, 60 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) and
   phosphorus (P) addition treatments (low-P, 20 mg kg(-1) and high-P, 40
   mg kg(-1)) on AMF since April 2017, which was reflected in AMF root
   colonization rates and spore density of rhizosphere soil. Our results
   showed that N deposition significantly decreased AMF root colonization
   rates and spore density. In N-free plots, P addition significantly
   decreased AMF root colonization rates, but did not significantly alter
   spore density. In low-N plots, colonization rates significantly
   decreased under low P addition, but significantly increased under high P
   addition, and spore density exhibited a significant decline under high P
   additions. In high-N plots, colonization rates and spore density
   significantly increased under P additions. Interactive effects of
   simulated N deposition and P addition on both colonization rates and
   spore density were significant. Moderate N deposition or P addition can
   weaken the symbiotic relationship between plants and AMF, significantly
   reducing AMF colonization rates and inhibiting spore production.
   However, a moderate addition of P greatly enhances spore yield. In the
   case of interactive effects, the AMF colonization rates and spore
   density are affected by the relative content of N and P in the soil.}},

Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Forest replacement by exotic plantations drive important changes at the
   level of the overstory, understory and forest floor. In the Atlantic
   Forest of northern Argentina, large areas have been replaced by loblolly
   pine (Pinus taedaL.) monocultures. Plant and litter transformation,
   together with harvesting operations, change microclimatic conditions and
   edaphic properties. Management practices such as thinning promote the
   development of native understory vegetation and could counterbalance
   negative effects of forest replacement on soil. Here, the effects of
   pine plantations and thinning on physical, chemical and microbiological
   soil properties were assessed. Bacterial, archaeal, and fungal community
   structure were analyzed using a metabarcoding approach targeting
   ribosomal markers. Forest replacement and, to a lesser extent, thinning
   practices in the pine plantations induced significant changes in soil
   physico-chemical properties and associated shifts in bacterial and
   fungal communities. Most measured physical and chemical properties were
   altered due to forest replacement, but a few of these properties reached
   values similar to natural forests under the thinning operation. Fungal
   alpha diversity decreased in pine plantations, whereas bacterial alpha
   diversity tended to increase but with little statistical support. Shifts
   in community composition were observed for both fungal and bacterial
   domains, and were mostly related to changes in plant understory
   composition, soil carbon, organic matter, water content, pH and bulk
   density. Among several other changes, highly abundant phyla such as
   Proteobacteria (driven by many genera) and Mortierellomycota (mainly
   driven byMortierella) decreased in relative abundance in the
   plantations, whereas Acidobacteria (mainly driven
   byAcidothermusandCandidatus Koribacter) and Basidiomycota (mainly driven
   by the ectomycorrhizaRussula) showed the opposite response. Taken
   together, these results provide insights into the effects of forest
   replacement on belowground properties and elucidate the potentially
   beneficial effect of thinning practices in intensive plantation systems
   through promoting the understory development. Although thinning did not
   entirely counterbalance the effects of forest replacement on physical,
   chemical and biological soil properties, the strategy helped mitigating
   the effects and might promote resilience of these properties by the end
   of the rotation cycle, if subsequent management practices compatible
   with the development of a native understory vegetation are applied.}},

Abstract = {{This account presents information on all aspects of the biology ofPoa
   nemoralisL. (Wood Meadow-grass) that are relevant to understanding its
   ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented
   within the standard framework of theBiological Flora of the British
   Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors,
   responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral
   and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation.
   The grassPoa nemoralisis widespread and frequent to locally common
   across the British Isles, except for western and central Ireland, and
   northern Scotland. In both its native Eurasian range and introduced
   ranges in, for example, the Americas, its main habitat comprises
   temperate (mixed) deciduous woodland. The species finds important
   secondary habitats in hedgerows, as well as in non-woodland vegetation
   such as on cliffs, screes and walls or sporadically in grassland and
   heathland. Although not always taxonomically or morphologically distinct
   units, the species is suspected to comprise many cytological races and
   hybrid polyploid populations with variable morphology. Morphological
   variation amongP. nemoralispopulations may also be a sign of local
   environmental adaptation or a result of introgressive hybridization with
   other, morphologically variable members ofPoasectionStenopoasuch asP.
   glauca,P. compressaorP. pratensis. Poa nemoralisis a small-statured,
   loosely caespitose grass, with populations ranging from a few individual
   tufts to those visually defining the aspect of the herbaceous
   understorey. The species tolerates moderate to deep shade on the forest
   floor, yet it tends to forage for available light, occurring more and
   growing taller in canopy gaps, forest edges and hedgerows. The amount of
   light is central to its survival and reproductive ecology, being
   important for flower induction, seed production and seed germination.
   The species produces large quantities of small, light seeds which
   facilitate spatial and temporal dispersal. The species occupies a wide
   range of soil pH (3-7) and nutrient conditions (C/N ratio ranges between
   10 and 25), though it clearly prefers moderately acid and somewhat drier
   soils with limited litter thickness, avoiding soils with mor humus
   types.Poa nemoralisdisplays distinct small-scale acidifuge responses,
   being absent in areas of low soil pH (<3). Poa nemoralisis a moderately
   strong indicator of ancient woodland: it can quickly colonize recently
   established wooded areas adjacent to ancient woodland when it is not
   hindered by dispersal limitation and elevated nutrient levels.
   Nonetheless, dispersal limitation impedes rapid colonization of
   isolated, recently established woodlands, in spite of ample records of
   zoochorous seed dispersal. While currently frequent to locally common,
   the species is at risk if ancient woodlands continue to decline in its
   native Eurasian range. Across N.W. Europe, it is already in moderate
   decline in temperate deciduous ancient woodlands because of

   and biological characteristics of soils from Ecuadorian highlands
   subjected to different management practices, as well as the density and
   diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Soils from naturalized
   grasslands and other previously cropped plots withZea maysandSolanum
   tuberosumwere analyzed in laboratory for soil biochemical properties,
   enzyme activity, and AMF colonization to determine the effect of the
   soil management over its quality. The characterization of AMF propagules
   associated to spontaneously colonizing plants in the above soils was
   also performed. Soil previously cropped withS. tuberosumshowed the
   highest glomalin content; at the same time, naturalized grassland andZ.
   mayscropped soils showed higher hyphal length. The acid phosphatase
   activity was higher in naturalized grasslands andZ. mayscropped soils
   compared with that in theS. tuberosumcropped soils. Moreover, the
   highest AMF colonization rates and spore number were found in different
   spontaneous plant species growing in the naturalized grasslands. This
   study represents the first characterization of AMF propagules of
   different cropped and naturalized grassland soils, and also is one of
   the first reports about changes on biochemical and microbial activities
   occurring in Andean soils from the highlands of Ecuador, undergoing

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF)
   produce contrasting plant-soil feedbacks, but how these feedbacks are
   constrained by lithology is poorly understood. We investigated the
   hypothesis that lithological drivers of soil fertility filter plant
   resource economic strategies in ways that influence the relative fitness
   of trees with AMF or EMF symbioses in a Bornean rain forest containing
   species with both mycorrhizal strategies. Using forest inventory data on
   1245 tree species, we found that although AMF-hosting trees had greater
   relative dominance on all soil types, with declining lithological soil
   fertility EMF-hosting trees became more dominant. Data on 13 leaf traits
   and wood density for a total of 150 species showed that variation was
   almost always associated with soil type, whereas for six leaf traits
   (structural properties; carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus ratios, nitrogen
   isotopes), variation was also associated with mycorrhizal strategy.
   EMF-hosting species had slower leaf economics than AMF-hosts,
   demonstrating the central role of mycorrhizal symbiosis in plant
   resource economies. At the global scale, climate has been shown to shape
   forest mycorrhizal composition, but here we show that in communities it
   depends on soil lithology, suggesting scale-dependent abiotic factors
   influence feedbacks underlying the relative fitness of different
   mycorrhizal strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Fungi are a key component of tropical biodiversity. However, due to
   their inconspicuous and largely subterranean nature, they are usually
   neglected in biodiversity inventories. The goal of this study was to
   identify the key determinants of fungal richness, community composition,
   and turnover in tropical rainforests. We tested specifically for the
   effect of soil properties, habitat, and locality in Amazonia. For these
   analyses, we used high-throughput sequencing data of short and long
   reads of fungal DNA present in soil and organic litter samples,
   combining existing and novel genomic data. Habitat type
   (phytophysiognomy) emerges as the strongest factor explaining fungal
   community composition. Naturally open areas-campinas-are the richest
   habitat overall. Soil properties have different effects depending on the
   soil layer (litter or mineral soil) and the choice of genetic marker. We
   suggest that campinas could be a neglected hotspot of fungal diversity.
   An underlying cause for their rich diversity may be the overall low soil
   fertility, which increases the reliance on biotic interactions essential
   for nutrient absorption in these environments, notably ectomycorrhizal
   fungi-plant associations. Our results highlight the advantages of using
   both short and long DNA reads produced through high-throughput
   sequencing to characterize fungal diversity. While short reads can
   suffice for diversity and community comparison, long reads add taxonomic
   precision and have the potential to reveal population diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a major disturbance linked to the evolutionary history and
   climate of Mediterranean ecosystems, where the vegetation has evolved
   fire-adaptive traits (e.g., serotiny in pines). In Mediterranean
   forests, mutualistic feedbacks between trees and ectomycorrhizal (ECM)
   fungi, essential for ecosystem dynamics, might be shaped by recurrent
   fires. We tested how the structure and function of ECM fungal
   communities ofPinus pinasterandPinus halepensisvary among populations
   subjected to high and low fire recurrence in Mediterranean ecosystems,
   and analysed the relative contribution of environmental (climate, soil
   properties) and tree-mediated (serotiny) factors. For both pines, local
   and regional ECM fungal diversity were lower in areas of high than low
   fire recurrence, although certain fungal species were favoured in the
   former. A general decline of ECM root-tip enzymatic activity forP.
   pinasterwas associated with high fire recurrence, but not forP.
   halepensis. Fire recurrence and fire-related factors such as climate,
   soil properties or tree phenotype explained these results. In addition
   to the main influence of climate, the tree fire-adaptive trait serotiny
   recovered a great portion of the variation in structure and function of
   ECM fungal communities associated with fire recurrence. Edaphic
   conditions (especially pH, tightly linked to bedrock type) were an
   important driver shaping ECM fungal communities, but mainly at the local
   scale and probably independently of the fire recurrence. Our results
   show that ECM fungal community shifts are associated with fire
   recurrence in fire-prone dry Mediterranean forests, and reveal complex
   feedbacks among trees, mutualistic fungi and the surrounding environment
   in these ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Temperate Forests Dominated by Arbuscular or Ectomycorrhizal Fungi Are
   Characterized by Strong Shifts from Saprotrophic to Mycorrhizal Fungi
   with Increasing Soil Depth}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{In temperate and boreal forests, competition for soil resources between
   free-living saprotrophs and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi has been
   suggested to restrict saprotrophic fungal dominance to the most
   superficial organic soil horizons in forests dominated by EcM trees. By
   contrast, lower niche overlap with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi
   could allow fungal saprotrophs to maintain this dominance into deeper
   soil horizons in AM-dominated forests. Here we used a natural gradient
   of adjacent forest patches that were dominated by either AM or EcM
   trees, or a mixture of both to determine how fungal communities
   characterized with high-throughput amplicon sequencing change across
   organic and mineral soil horizons. We found a general shift from
   saprotrophic to mycorrhizal fungal dominance with increasing soil depth
   in all forest mycorrhizal types, especially in organic horizons.
   Vertical changes in soil chemistry, including pH, organic matter,
   exchangeable cations, and extractable phosphorus, coincided with shifts
   in fungal community composition. Although fungal communities and soil
   chemistry differed among adjacent forest mycorrhizal types, variations
   were stronger within a given soil profile, pointing to the importance of
   considering horizons when characterizing soil fungal communities. Our
   results also suggest that in temperate forests, vertical shifts from
   saprotrophic to mycorrhizal fungi within organic and mineral horizons
   occur similarly in both ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal
   forests.}},

Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to assess the impact of several methods of
   mulching degraded forest soil with wood chips on the development of mite
   (Acari) community, with particular emphasis to oribatid mites
   (Oribatida), and on the growth of young plantings of Scots pine (Pinus
   sylvestrisL.). Mulching with wood chips should contribute to revitalize
   soil fauna and restore natural forests on degraded soils. Scots pine
   seedlings were planted at the post-military training ground. Four
   experimental treatments were tested: control-uncovered soil (C),
   mulching with wood chips (W), W + mycorrhiza preparation (WM), and W +
   forest litter (WL). At the end of the growing season in 2012, 2013 and
   2014, the following plant measurements were carried out: length of
   annual increment of the main stem, stem base diameter, number and
   lengths of lateral shoots in the annual whorl. The mite calculations
   included average mite density, dominance index, species richness,
   oribatid mite diversity, average number of species, and Shannon general
   species diversity index. The use of mulching with wood chips did not
   significantly affect the growth characteristics of Scots pine plants,
   but strongly increased the mite community. After mulching, the total
   number and species diversity of Acari increased many times, and
   Oribatida began to dominate among micro-arthropods. The number of
   Oribatida increased most in W. The largest species diversity was
   observed in WL. 24 species of Oribatida were found that were used as the
   bio-indicators of soil succession changes.Tectocepheus velatusclearly
   dominated in all mulching treatments.Oppiella novaandScutovertex
   sculptuswere also numerous populations of Oribatida. The study shows
   that mulching with Scots pine wood chips, especially with the addition
   of forest litter, significantly enriches soil fauna and is therefore
   useful in the regeneration process of degenerated forest soils.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon (C) fluxes among different components of plant growth are
   important to forest ecosystem C cycling and are strongly influenced by
   species composition and resource availability. Although mycorrhizal
   fungi are crucial for nutrient acquisition and can receive a large
   fraction of annual net primary production, most studies do not
   explicitly include carbon flux to mycorrhizal fungi in ecosystem C
   budgets. We measured annual production of plant components (foliage,
   wood, fine roots) and mycorrhizal fungi across temperate forest stands
   varying in species composition. Production of mycorrhizal fungi was
   estimated using both mass balance and isotopic techniques. Total plant
   production varied from about 600 g C m(-2) y(-1) in nearly pure
   deciduous broadleaf stands down to about 300 g C m(-2) y(-1) in
   conifer-dominated stands. In contrast, the production of mycorrhizal
   fungi was highest in conifer-dominated stands, varying from less than 25
   g C m(-2) y(-1) in deciduous broadleaf stands to more than 175 g C m(-2)
   y(-1) in nearly pure conifer stands. Isotopic data indicated that both
   tree species composition and ecosystem nitrogen (N) availability
   influenced rates of fungal production. The large investment in
   mycorrhizal fungi in low-N, conifer-dominated stands demonstrated that a
   full accounting of ecosystem carbon fluxes to plant and fungal
   components may help resolve current discrepancies observed in broadscale
   forest carbon budgets, especially across forest types.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical montane cloud forests contain a large abundance and diversity
   of canopy epiphytes, which depend on canopy soil to retain water and
   nutrients. We lack an in depth understanding of how these soils
   contribute to ecosystem processes and soil diversity and how sensitive
   they may be to projected climate change. We compared canopy and ground
   soils in Monteverde, Costa Rica, to determine how these two soil types
   differ in their extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) and fungal
   communities. Samples were also collected along two elevation gradients
   to reveal if canopy soils differed in how EEA and fungal communities
   responded to elevation compared to ground soils. We found that canopy
   soils had higher EEA than ground soils. Fungal communities were less
   diverse and differed significantly between the two soil types. These
   differences were associated with higher relative abundances of yeasts
   and endophytes in canopy soils. The relative abundances of free-living
   filamentous fungi and yeasts shifted more dramatically with elevation in
   canopy soils compared to ground soils. Our study suggests that canopy
   soils may be a reservoir for endophytes. Epiphytes may invest in
   symbionts that promote stress tolerance over mycorrhizal fungi whose
   high resource demands are costly and less beneficial. Overall, soils

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Characterizing the chemical changes in fungal necromass as it degrades,
   particularly over short time intervals (days to weeks), is critical to
   clearly understanding how this organic matter source contributes to
   various belowground carbon and nutrient pools. Using a range of chemical
   analyses, we assessed the degradation of four types of ectomycorrhizal
   fungal necromass from three species differing in biochemical
   composition. Samples were buried in a forest in Minnesota, USA and
   harvested at eight time points over a 90-day incubation period (1, 2, 4,
   7, 14, 28, 60, 90 days). Three of the necromass types lost greater than
   50\% of their initial mass in the first seven days, but mass loss
   plateaued for all four types at later harvests, and after 90 days, none
   of the samples were completely degraded. Relative to undegraded
   necromass, degraded necromass consistently contained a lower relative
   abundance of aliphatic compounds and a higher relative abundance of
   carbohydrates, sterols, and aromatic compounds. For three of the four
   necromass types, nitrogen content was lower after 90 days of degradation
   and FTIR spectra revealed distinct peaks broadening from day 0 to day
   90. While melanin content significantly slowed degradation within
   species, differences in degradation rates across species were more
   closely aligned with initial nitrogen content. Collectively, our results
   indicate that the rapid mass loss of dead fungal mycelium is accompanied
   by a wide range of changes in necromass chemistry, likely contributing
   to both short-term soil nutrient and longer-term carbon pools. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Despite the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in temperate
   forests, knowledge concerning their diversity and interactions with
   plants is still insufficient. Therefore, we studied the impact of
   overstorey species identity on AMF abundance and species richness and
   composition in relation to herbaceous plant cover and soil chemical
   properties. The effects of 14 tree species grown for 48 years in
   monospecific plots in the Siemianice Experimental Forest (western
   Poland) were compared, including the following groupings: deciduous vs
   coniferous; native to Poland/Europe vs alien; forming vs not forming
   arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM). Coniferous tree plots were characterised by
   lower pH values, plots with deciduous trees by higher concentrations of
   total Ca and exchangeable forms of Ca, K and Mg. AMF abundance in soils
   and roots increased along with increasing soil alkalinity and
   macronutrient levels. Concentrations of the PLFA 16:omega 5 AMF hyphal
   biomass marker were higher in the soils of deciduous and AM-type tree
   species than those of coniferous and non-AM types. In addition,
   concentrations of the NLFA 16:16 omega 5 AMF spore biomass marker were
   higher in the soils of deciduous tree species. No significant
   differences were found between groups of native and alien tree species.
   AMF spore and species numbers were low in comparison to other unforested
   ecosystems, averaging 77.5 and 1.2 per 50 g of soils, respectively. The
   presence of 8 AMF species, both widespread (e.g. Funneliformis
   constrictus) and rare (Acaulospora cavernata) was revealed. Significant
   divergence in AMF species composition was noted between plots of
   deciduous and coniferous species. Our study showed that tree species
   identity, considered as a single factor, has only a slight impact on
   determining AMF community characteristics. The disparity between AMF
   community characteristics results from the effects of several factors,

Abstract = {{The current requirements to decrease the consumption and greenhouse gas
   emissions of fossil fuels have increased the demand of renewable energy
   sources. In forestry, this situation has intensified harvesting
   practices resulting in a decreased amount of woody debris left on the
   clear-cut areas. Impacts of energy wood harvest on wood-decomposing
   fungi were studied in a large-scale experiment in clear-cut stands in
   three geographical areas in Finland. A sequence of treatments was
   expected to form a forestry induced soil disturbance gradient: (1)
   logging residues left at site, no soil preparation; (2) logging residues
   left at site, patch mounding; (3) 70\% logging residue removal, patch
   mounding; and (4) complete stump and logging residue removal, patch
   mounding. Pre-weighed wood discs were incubated on the intact soil cover
   for four years to estimate decomposition rate and fungal decomposer
   community. A soil sample was taken underneath each disc to evaluate the
   direct inoculation potential of the soil. The main results were as
   follows: (1) The differences between the treatments were not
   significant, while the geographical factors affected the decomposition
   rate and the fungal communities of the wood discs. (2) The fungal
   composition in the wood discs did not reflect the underlying soil fungal
   community, which indicates that a part of the fungal species inhabiting
   wood discs originated from airborne surrounding sources. (3) The
   increase in fungal species diversity was associated to the wood decay
   process, indicated by parallel increase in the wood decomposition rate
   and the number of white rot and mycorrhizal fungi. Thus our study
   indicates that in addition to local environment, landscape-level factors

Title = {{Canopy and understory nitrogen additions did not significantly change
   the community structure of soil fauna under a mature subtropical forest}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{718}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Increasing nitrogen (N) deposition has seriously harmed the structure
   and function of ecosystems throughout the world and this problem has
   been increasing. How N deposition affects soil faunal communities is
   poorly understood, compared to plant and microbial communities. Canopy
   and understory N additions of 25 and 50 kg ha(-1) year(-1) were employed
   to determine whether the effects of N addition on the soil fauna differ
   between N released to the canopy or to the understory. Specifically, we
   examined how the soil fauna survives when N additions produce
   desynchronized and complex impacts on the soil, microbes and litter
   quantity under mature subtropical forest ecosystems. Our results showed
   that no significant differences were observed between the soil faunal
   communities receiving canopy and understory N additions. This is
   consistent with our observation that the concentrations of ammonia
   nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in the soil did not significantly differ
   under the two different methods of applying N. There were no observed
   effects on the litter quantity, soil microbial Phospholipid Fatty Acids
   or soil physical-chemical properties; therefore, it is not surprising
   that N treatments for 4 years did not significantly alter the community
   structure of soil fauna under the mature subtropical forest sites.
   However, the shifts in seasonal differences in the microbial communities
   under the N treatments had a positive effect on soil microbial
   development compared to control, which might also produce a time-delay
   influence on the relative development of the soil fauna under mature
   subtropical forest in the future. Further dynamic monitoring is needed
   to illustrate the possible effects and mechanisms by which increasing N
   deposition may alter soil faunal development in the future. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Eukaryote-associated microbiomes vary across host taxa and environments
   but the key factors underlying their diversity and structure in fungi
   are still poorly understood. Here we determined the structure of
   bacterial communities in fungal fruitbodies in relation to the main
   chemical characteristics in ectomycorrhizal (EcM) and saprotrophic (SAP)
   mushrooms as well as in the surrounding soil. Our analyses revealed
   significant differences in the structure of endofungal bacterial
   communities across fungal phylogenetic groups and to a lesser extent
   across fungal guilds. These variations could be partly ascribed to
   differences in fruitbody chemistry, particularly the carbon-to-nitrogen
   ratio and pH. Fungal fruitbodies appear to represent nutrient-rich
   islands that derive their microbiome largely from the underlying
   continuous soil environment, with a larger overlap of operational
   taxonomic units observed between SAP fruitbodies and the surrounding
   soil, compared with EcM fungi. In addition, bacterial taxa involved in
   the decomposition of organic material were relatively more abundant in
   SAP fruitbodies, whereas those involved in release of minerals were
   relatively more enriched in EcM fruitbodies. Such contrasts in patterns
   and underlying processes of the microbiome structure between SAP and EcM
   fungi provide further evidence that bacteria can support the functional
   roles of these fungi in terrestrial ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Winter air temperatures are rising faster than summer air temperatures
   in high-latitude forests, increasing the frequency of soil freeze/thaw
   events in winter. To determine how climate warming and soil freeze/thaw
   cycles affect soil microbial communities and the ecosystem processes
   they drive, we leveraged the Climate Change across Seasons Experiment
   (CCASE) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the northeastern
   United States, where replicate field plots receive one of three climate
   treatments: warming (+5 degrees C above ambient in the growing season),
   warming in the growing season + winter freeze/thaw cycles (+5 degrees C
   above ambient +4 freeze/thaw cycles during winter), and no treatment.
   Soil samples were taken from plots at six time points throughout the
   growing season and subjected to amplicon (rDNA) and metagenome
   sequencing. We found that soil fungal and bacterial community
   composition were affected by changes in soil temperature, where the
   taxonomic composition of microbial communities shifted more with the
   combination of growing-season warming and increased frequency of soil
   freeze/thaw cycles in winter than with warming alone. Warming increased
   the relative abundance of brown rot fungi and plant pathogens but
   decreased that of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, all of which recovered
   under combined growing-season warming and soil freeze/thaw cycles in
   winter. The abundance of animal parasites increased significantly under
   combined warming and freeze/thaw cycles. We also found that warming and
   soil freeze/thaw cycles suppressed bacterial taxa with the genetic
   potential for carbon (i.e., cellulose) decomposition and soil nitrogen
   cycling, such as N fixation and the final steps of denitrification.
   These new soil communities had higher genetic capacity for stress
   tolerance and lower genetic capacity to grow or reproduce, relative to
   the communities exposed to warming in the growing season alone. Our
   observations suggest that initial suppression of biogeochemical cycling
   with year-round climate change may be linked to the emergence of taxa
   that trade-off growth for stress tolerance traits.}},

Abstract = {{In nitrogen (N)-limited boreal forests, trees depend on the decomposing
   activity of their ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal symbionts to access soil
   N. A large fraction of this N exists as proteinaceous compounds
   associated with mineral particles. However, it is not known if ECM fungi
   can access these mineral-associated proteins; accordingly, possible
   acquisition mechanisms have not been investigated.
   With tightly controlled isotopic, spectroscopic, and chromatographic
   experiments, we quantified and analyzed the mechanisms of N acquisition
   from iron oxide mineral-associated proteins by Paxillus involutus, a
   widespread ECM fungus in boreal forests.
   The fungus acquired N from the mineral-associated proteins. The
   collective results indicated a proteolytic mechanism involving formation
   of the crucial enzyme-substrate complexes at the mineral surfaces.
   Hence, the enzymes hydrolyzed the mineral-associated proteins without
   initial desorption of the proteins. The proteolytic activity was
   suppressed by adsorption of proteases to the mineral particles. This
   process was counteracted by fungal secretion of mineral-surface-reactive
   compounds that decreased the protease-mineral interactions and thereby
   promoted the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes.
   The ability of ECM fungi to simultaneously generate extracellular
   proteases and surface-reactive metabolites suggests that they can play
   an important role in unlocking the large N pool of mineral-associated
   proteins to trees in boreal forests.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of natural forest conversion (NFC) on soil nutrient turnover are
   substantially mediated by soil microbial extracellular hydrolytic
   enzymatic activities (Hy-EEAs) and oxidative enzymatic activities
   (Ox-EEAs). Yet it remains largely unknown the indicative links between
   soil Hy- and Ox-EEAs and soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus
   (P) supplies based on economic theories of microbial metabolism under
   NFC. Here we used a meta-analysis approach to synthesize the responses
   of the soil C-, N-, P-degrading Hy-EEAs and Ox-EEAs, soil microbial
   biomass, soil organic C, total N. P and available P parameters to
   natural forest conversion from 51 peer-reviewed studies. Our results
   showed that NFC notably decreased soil Hy-EEAs but statistically
   insignificant reduction of soil Ox-EEAs. The changes of soil Hy- and
   Ox-EEAs were significantly and positively associated with soil organic
   C, available P as well as microbial biomass C and N but significantly
   and negatively correlated with soil pH, whereas the changes of soil C/N
   impacted on soil Ox-EEAs remarkably but not for soil Hy-EEAs. The
   depletion of soil organic carbon stimulated soil microbial secretion of
   Hy- and Ox-EEAs. The soil total N scarcity only provoked soil microbial
   Hy-EEAs rather than Ox-EEAs. The soil total P dearth quickened the soil
   Ox-EEAs, however, the plenitude of soil available P suppressed soil Hy-
   and Ox-EEAs. Moreover, the eco-enzymatic stoichiometry of soil Hy-EEAs
   indicated that soil N and P nutrient limitation after NEC restricted
   soil microbial N- and P-acquiring enzymes secretion, which ultimately
   reduced resources availability for C acquisition. Altogether, the
   distinct responses of soil Hy- and Ox-EEAs depended on substrate
   availability peculiarly for soil N and P gains of microorganisms for

Abstract = {{The land-use change is a major determinant influencing ecosystem carbon
   (C) patterns and nutrient cycling in subalpine forests in the Eastern
   Tibetan Plateau. While some results have been obtained in relation to
   the influence of land-use change on aboveground components, less is
   known about the belowground microbial communities and related processes.
   We assessed the structure and function of soil microbial communities
   following land-use change from old-growth forest (OF) to secondary
   forest (SF), plantation forest (PF), and grassland (GL) in the Eastern
   Tibetan Plateau, China. Phospholipid fatty acid profiles and enzyme
   activity analysis were used to determine the composition and activities
   of microbial communities, respectively. Significant differences in
   physicochemical characteristics, microbial communities, and
   extracellular enzyme activities in soils under different land uses were
   observed in this study. pH and total nitrogen (TN) in OF and SF were
   significantly higher than in GL. PF showed the highest soil organic C
   (SOC), and significantly higher than in GL. Total phosphorus (TP) and
   C/N ratio in PF were significantly higher than the other land-use types.
   OF and PF had significantly higher anaerobic bacteria than in GL. The
   actinobacteria in SF was significantly higher than in PF. The
   saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal (SEM) fungi was significantly lower in
   GL than the other land-use types. Total microbial biomass and
   beta-glucosidase activities were significantly higher in OF and SF than
   in GL. GL had significantly higher polyphenoloxidase activities than in
   OF and PF. Anaerobic bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and SEM
   fungi were positively correlated with SOC and TP, Gram+ bacteria were
   correlated with C/P and N/P ratio. N-acetylglucosaminidase activity was
   negatively correlated with anaerobic bacteria, while polyphenoloxidase
   activity was positively related to actinobacteria. Furthermore,
   redundancy analysis revealed that the microbial community composition
   was primarily regulated by TN and pH. This suggested that altered
   land-use type initiated changes in the physicochemical characteristics
   of the soils, which affected the composition of microbial communities
   and microbial enzyme activities related to nutrient cycling in this
   area. This provides a scientific basis for the influence mechanism of
   land use on composition and function of microbial communities, as well

Abstract = {{The effects of leaf litter on moisture content and fungal decay
   development in above-ground wood specimens were assessed. Untreated
   southern pine specimens were exposed with or without leaf litter
   contact. Two types of leaf litter were evaluated; aged (decomposed) and
   young (early stages of decomposition). The moisture content of specimens
   was monitored, and specimens were periodically removed for visual
   evaluation of decay development. In addition, amplicon-based sequencing
   analysis of specimens and associated leaf litter was conducted at two
   time points. Contact with either type of leaf litter resulted in
   consistently higher moisture contents than those not in contact with
   leaf litter. Visually, evident decay developed most rapidly in specimens

   the available wood decay fungal community with similar communities found
   in the litter exposed wood and litter itself, but dissimilar community
   profiles from unexposed wood. Dominant species and guild composition
   shifted over time, beginning initially with more leaf saprophytes

Abstract = {{Truffles contribute both directly and indirectly to important dynamics
   in the soil web, being involved in a large number of ecological
   functions that are crucial for terrestrial ecosystems. Despite this, the
   interrelationships between true truffles, i.e. hypogeous ectomycorrhizal
   fungi producing valuable fruiting bodies, and other elements of the soil
   system are largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to shed new light on
   whether and how much Tuber aestivum affects soil microbial activities
   (evaluated as enzyme activities), abundance (assayed as soil DNA
   content) and bacterial genetic diversity along with soil chemical
   properties. We compared chemical and biological variables inside and
   outside britles (i.e. areas inhabited by truffles with scarce vegetation
   cover around host plants) in two seasons, namely spring and summer,
   using both a linear mixed model and a multivariate two-block partial
   least squares approach. The areas with truffle presence had higher pH
   but lower organic carbon and nitrogen content. Similarly, all enzyme
   activities were lower inside the brule than outside, with the exception
   of peroxidase. A soil quality index (i.e. AI3) based on three enzyme
   activities (beta-glucosidase, acid phosphomonoesterase and urease)
   indicated a reduction in soil quality inside the brule. Overall, soil
   DNA content responded to an interaction of truffle presence/absence and
   season, while bacterial genetic diversity indexes were higher in spring.
   Despite the observational nature of this study, results point out that
   T. aestivum can be considered a key species in the soil where it is

   microbial activity that were generally more conspicuous than mere
   seasonal effects, although the causative nature of these associations
   still needs to be confirmed.}},

Abstract = {{Insect herbivory can have important consequences for the functioning of
   terrestrial ecosystems. Despite a growing recognition of the role of
   herbivores in above-ground-below-ground interactions, our current
   understanding is mainly restricted to studies of vertebrates in
   grassland and tundra ecosystems, while ecosystems with tree-like
   canopies (termed forests below) and invertebrates remain understudied.
   Here, we assess the current state of knowledge of one key aspect of
   plant-herbivore interactions by conducting a meta-analysis of the
   peer-reviewed literature on the below-ground consequences of
   above-ground insect herbivory in forest ecosystems. Main results are
   reported as aggregated relative effect sizes (Cohen's d).
   We find that above-ground insect herbivory reduced below-ground carbon
   (C) allocation by plants to roots (-0.56) and root exudation (-0.85),
   causing shifts in root-symbiont communities, for example, a decrease
   (-0.67) in the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Microbial decomposer
   abundances showed no significant responses, while soil faunal abundances
   increased (0.50). C and nitrogen (N) mineralization rates (C: 0.48, N:
   0.48) along with nutrient leaching (C: 0.30, N: 0.77) increased, with a
   stronger response to outbreak relative to background insect densities.
   The negative responses increased in strength in colder and dryer biomes
   while positive responses were reinforced in warmer and wetter biomes,
   thus extending previously shown effects for vertebrate herbivores to
   also include insect herbivory. The positive response by soil fauna to
   insect herbivory was the notable exception. This may be associated with
   the limited physical soil disturbance caused by insects compared to
   ungulates. Furthermore, we identified an under-representation in the
   literature of large areas of boreal and tropical biomes calling for
   research priorities to fill these knowledge gaps. We present three
   recommendations for future research: addressing (a) biological drivers
   of biogeochemistry and response pathways, (b) knowledge gap from boreal
   and tropical forests, and (c) heterogeneity of herbivore disturbances.
   Synthesis. Insect herbivores significantly accelerate soil C and N
   cycling during outbreaks in forest ecosystems, but we lack knowledge on
   the underlying biological drivers. Overall, below-ground responses to
   insect herbivory are similar to vertebrate herbivory responses, which
   may simplify implementing herbivory effects into ecosystem models.
   Nonetheless, we identify a few important differences and general
   knowledge gaps on which we base recommendations for future research.}},

   mid-successional tree species. Since the 18th century Q. rubra has been
   introduced into forest management in Europe and elsewhere. Currently, Q.
   rubra is a naturalized species in 23 countries. It is an important
   source of wood, and this was one of the most important reasons for its
   introduction in forests. In forest management this species is valued for
   its high growth rate and drought resistance. Red Oak is also widely
   cultivated in Europe for its ornamental value-red leaves in autumn and
   smooth, grey bark.
   Red Oak is a threat to native species within its introduced range as it
   can alter environmental conditions beneath its canopy, especially by
   decreasing light availability and litter decomposition rate. Such
   conditions also contribute to biotic homogenization of the understorey
   vegetation. Q. rubra is widely dispersed by small mammals and birds, up
   to 1,500 m from seed sources, thereby increasing its potential
   invasiveness.
   In Europe Q. rubra seems to be less prone to herbivores and fungi, in
   contrast to its native range, where it is grazed by ungulates and
   insects, and infected by Phytophthora and oak wilt. Due to its higher
   tolerance to drought than native European oaks, Q. rubra is claimed to
   be one of the species replacing native trees which are decreasing due to
   climate warming. However, consideration of all possible consequences is
   needed in wide-scale introduction of alien species, such as Q. rubra,
   due to negative impacts on native ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Nutrient addition reduces carbon sequestration in a Tibetan grassland
   soil: Disentangling microbial and physical controls}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{144}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability strongly affects carbon (C)
   cycling and storage in terrestrial ecosystems. Nutrient addition can
   increase C inputs into soil via increased above- and belowground plant
   productivity, but at the same time can accelerate organic matter
   decomposition in the soil. The mechanisms underlying these effects on
   soil organic C (SOC) dynamics remain unclear, especially in
   nutrient-limited alpine ecosystems that have been subjected to
   increasing N and P availability in recent decades. The aim of this study
   was to clarify the mechanisms underlying SOC decomposition and
   stabilization in an alpine grassland soil after four years of N and P
   additions. The soil aggregate size distribution, microbial community
   structure (lipid biomarkers), microbial C use efficiency (CUE) and
   microbial necromass composition (amino sugar biomarkers) were analyzed.
   Nutrient addition increased dominance of fast-growing bacteria
   (copiotrophs), while P addition alone intensified the competitive
   interactions between arbuscular mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi.
   These changes led to decreases in the microbial CUE of glucose by
   1.6-3.5\% and of vanillin by 8.5\%, and therefore, reduced SOC content
   in the topsoil. The total microbial necromass remained unaffected by
   nutrient addition, but the contribution of fungal necromass to SOC
   increased. The increased abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and
   fungal necromass under elevated N availability raised the mass
   proportion of soil macroaggregates (>250 mu m) by 16.5-20.3\%.
   Therefore, fungi were highly involved in macroaggregation following N
   addition, and so, moderated the SOC losses through enhanced physical
   protection. Overall, the complex interactions between microbial
   physiology (CUE), necromass composition (amino sugars) and physical
   protection (macroaggregation) in mediating SOC dynamics in response to
   nutrient enrichment were disentangled to better predict the capability
   of alpine grassland soils to act as a C sink or source under global
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Coffea arabica is a highly traded commodity worldwide, and its
   plantations are habitat to a wide range of organisms. Coffee farmers are
   shifting away from traditional shade coffee farms in favor of
   sun-intensive, higher yield farms, which can impact local biodiversity.
   Using plant-associated microorganisms in biofertilizers, particularly
   fungi collected from local forests, to increase crop yields has gained
   traction among coffee producers. However, the taxonomic and spatial
   distribution of many fungi in coffee soil, nearby forests and
   biofertilizers is unknown. We collected soil samples from a sun coffee
   system, shade coffee system, and nearby forest from Izalco, Sonsonate,
   El Salvador. At each coffee system, we collected soil from the surface
   (upper) and 10 cm below the surface (lower), and from the coffee plant
   drip line (drip line) and the walkway between two plants (walkway).
   Forest soils were collected from the surface only. We used ITS
   metabarcoding to characterize fungal communities in soil and in the
   biofertilizer (applied in both coffee systems), and assigned fungal taxa
   to functional guilds using FUNGuild. In the sun and shade coffee
   systems, we found that drip line soil had higher richness in
   pathotrophs, symbiotrophs, and saprotrophs than walkway soil, suggesting
   that fungi select for microhabitats closer to coffee plants. Upper and
   lower soil depths did not differ in fungal richness or composition,
   which may reflect the shallow root system of Coffea arabica. Soil from
   shade, sun, and forest had similar numbers of fungal taxa, but differed
   dramatically in community composition, indicating that local habitat
   differences drive fungal species sorting among systems. Yet, some fungal
   taxa were shared among systems, including seven fungal taxa present in
   the biofertilizer. Understanding the distribution of coffee soil
   mycobiomes can be used to inform sustainable, ecologically friendly
   farming practices and identify candidate plant-growth promoting fungi
   for future studies.}},

Journal = {{MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Soil fungi are ecologically important as decomposers, pathogens, and
   symbionts in nature. Understanding their biogeographic patterns and
   driving forces is pivotal to predict alterations arising from
   environmental changes in ecosystem. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an
   essential resource for soil fungi; however, the role of its quality in
   structuring fungal community patterns remains elusive. Here using
   Illumina MiSeq sequencing, we characterized total fungi and their
   functional groups in 45 soil samples collected from a 1500-km sampling
   transect through semi-arid regions in northern China, which are
   currently suffering great pressure from climate change. Total fungi and
   their functional groups were all observed to exhibit significant
   biogeographic patterns which were primarily driven by environmental
   variables. DOM quality was the best and consistent predictor of
   diversity of both total fungi and functional groups. Specifically,
   plant-derived DOM was associated with greater diversity relative to
   microbe-dominated origins. In addition, fungal diversity linearly
   increased with increases in degree of humification in DOM. Similarly,
   among all measured environmental variables, DOM quality had the
   strongest effects on the community composition of total fungi and
   functional groups. Together, our work contributes to the factors
   underlying fungal biogeographic patterns and adds detail to the
   importance of DOM quality in structuring fungal communities.}},

Abstract = {{Fungal mycelium is increasingly recognized as a central component of

   By deploying common fungal necromass substrates in a temperate oak

   generality of the rate at which high- and low-quality fungal necromass
   decomposes; further, we investigated how the decomposer `necrobiome'
   varies both across and within sites under vegetation types dominated by
   either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal plants.
   The effects of necromass quality on decay rate were robust to site and
   vegetation type differences, with high-quality fungal necromass
   decomposing, on average, 2.5 times faster during the initial stages of
   decay. Across vegetation types, bacterial and fungal communities present
   on decaying necromass differed from bulk soil microbial communities and
   were influenced by necromass quality. Moulds, yeasts and copiotrophic
   bacteria consistently dominated the necrobiome of high-quality fungal
   substrates.
   Synthesis. We show that regardless of differences in decay environments,
   high-quality fungal substrates decompose faster and support different
   types of decomposer micro-organisms when compared with low-quality

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Biogenic volatile organic compounds (bVOCs) play important roles in
   ecological interactions and Earth system processes, yet the biological
   and physical processes that drive soil bVOC exchanges remain poorly
   understood. In temperate forests, nearly all tree species associate with
   arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Given
   well-established differences in soil biogeochemistry between
   AM-dominated and ECM-dominated stands, we hypothesized that bVOC
   exchanges with the atmosphere would differ between soils from the two
   stand types. We measured bVOC fluxes at the soil-atmosphere interface in
   plots dominated by AM- and ECM-associated trees in a deciduous forest in
   south-central Indiana, USA during the early and late vegetative growing
   season. Soils in both AM- and ECM-dominated plots were a net bVOC sink
   following leaf-out and were a greater bVOC sink or smaller source at
   warmer soil temperatures (T-s). The flux of different bVOCs from ECM
   plots was often related to soil water content in addition to T-s.
   Methanol dominated total bVOC fluxes, and ECM soils demonstrated greater
   uptake relative to AM-dominated plots, on the order of 170 nmol m(-2)
   hr(-1) during the early growing season. Our results demonstrate the
   importance of soil dynamics characterized by mycorrhizal associations to
   bVOC dynamics in forested ecosystems and emphasize the need to study
   bidirectional soil bVOC uptake and emission processes.
   Plain Language Summary Plants and soils emit and absorb complex
   carbon-containing molecules in ways that remain poorly understood. These
   molecules-called ``biogenic volatile organic compounds,{''} or
   bVOCs-mediate ecological interactions, including plant defense, and also
   impact atmospheric chemistry, including aerosol formation. We are
   becoming more aware of the importance of ``mycorrhizal associations{''}
   as indicators of biogeochemical variation in forests. Tree species that
   associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi typically have fast-decaying
   leaf litters and faster nutrient cycling relative to tree species that
   associate with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which generally have
   slow-decaying leaf litters and slower nutrient cycling. As such, we
   hypothesized that forest plots dominated arbuscular mycorrhizal- versus
   ECM-associated trees would differ in their bVOC emissions. We measured
   soil bVOC flux in a deciduous forest in Indiana, USA, and noted that
   soils that were dominated by ECM fungi had greater bVOC uptake,
   especially when soils were warmer. bVOC uptake in soils dominated by ECM
   fungi was also sensitive to soil moisture. With this new knowledge, we
   can create improved models of bVOC fluxes at the ecosystem scale to gain
   a richer understanding of how soil characteristics impact ecosystem
   processes and atmospheric chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic emissions have impacted terrestrial forest ecosystem
   processes in North America since the industrial revolution. With the
   passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970 in the United States, atmospheric
   inputs of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) into forests in the Appalachian
   Mountains have declined, which have, potentially, mitigated their
   effects on processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling.
   Activities of microbial extracellular soil enzymes (ESEs) mediate many
   rate-limiting nutrient transformations in forest soils and play
   important roles in the decomposition of complex organic compounds. Soils
   in high-elevation red spruce forests are characterized by low pH and
   high carbon (C):N ratios and, having historically received extremely
   high levels of N deposition, may exhibit legacy impacts of deposition on
   nutrient availability and decomposition. We utilized four sites along a
   modeled gradient of N deposition in central Appalachia to assess
   contemporary ESEs in bulk soil under Acer rubrum L., Betula
   alleghaniensis Britt., and Picea rubens Sarg. in May, June, and July
   2016. Increasing N deposition led to increases in organic fraction C and
   N and decreases in phosphorus (P). Sites receiving higher N also
   exhibited greater mineral fraction C, N, and P. ESEs were highest in
   organic fractions with acid phosphatases (AP) exhibiting the highest
   activity. There was little influence of N deposition on organic fraction
   ESEs, but strong evidence for a positive relationship between N
   deposition and activities of AP, beta -glucosidases (BG), and chitinase
   (NAG) in mineral fractions. Species effects on ESEs were present with
   high AP in organic fractions under spruce and high mineral fraction
   fungal laccase (LAC) under birch. The sampling season demonstrated
   little effect on ESEs. ESEs were more strongly influenced by plot-level
   factors, such as tree species diversity and abundance of ectomycorrhizal
   (ECM) tree species, than temporal or soil factors or nutrient status
   related to modeled cumulative N deposition across these sites. Decreases
   in AP, BG, and NAG activities with greater abundance of broadleaf
   deciduous species and increases in activities with ECM host abundance
   indicate that microbial communities driven by these plant functional
   groups are responsible for the differences in ESEs observed in these
   high-elevation mixed red spruce stands.}},

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF) are involved in soil nutrient cycling in

Abstract = {{Aims Heterogeneous canopies in temperate montane forests affect
   microclimate and soil characteristics, with important effects on soil
   microbial communities and related processes. Here, we studied the
   interactions between plant root traits and soil bacterial and fungal
   communities in closed forest and open gaps in a mixed forest along an
   elevational gradient in the French Alps (1400, 1700 and 2000 m). Methods
   Samples were separated into three fractions (plant root, rhizosphere and
   bulk soil), to further investigate the influence of plant zones on
   microbial communities. Bacterial (16S) and fungal (ITS) biodiversity was
   determined using high throughput sequencing, along with standard
   measures of soil, litter and root traits. Results We found that (i)
   microbial community diversity was higher in gaps than in closed forest
   because of increased root trait diversity and density; (ii) open versus
   closed forest patches affected phylogenetic dispersion despite
   differences in elevations with phylogenetic clustering in closed forest;
   (iii) the interaction between root traits and microbial communities was
   stronger for rhizosphere and root fractions than for bulk soil and (iv)
   bacterial community composition was better explained by root traits than
   for fungi. Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of open
   gaps versus closed forest patches and associated root traits affecting
   microbial community structure, particularly for bacterial assemblages
   that exhibited a stronger interaction with root traits than for fungi.}},

Abstract = {{Plant nutrients can be recycled through microbial decomposition of
   organic matter but replacement of base cations and phosphorus, lost
   through harvesting of biomass/biofuels or leaching, requires de novo
   supply of fresh nutrients released through weathering of soil parent
   material (minerals and rocks). Weathering involves physical and chemical
   processes that are modified by biological activity of plants,
   microorganisms and animals. This article reviews recent progress made in
   understanding biological processes contributing to weathering. A
   perspective of increasing spatial scale is adopted, examining the
   consequences of biological activity for weathering from nanoscale
   interactions, through in vitro and in planta microcosm and meso-cosm
   studies, to field experiments, and finally ecosystem and global level
   effects. The topics discussed include the physical alteration of
   minerals and mineral surfaces; the composition, amounts, chemical
   properties, and effects of plant and microbial secretions; and the role
   of carbon flow (including stabilisation and sequestration of C in
   organic and inorganic forms). Although the predominant focus is on the
   effects of fungi in forest ecosystems, the properties of biofilms,
   including bacterial interactions, are also discussed. The implications
   of these biological processes for modelling are discussed, and we
   attempt to identify some key questions and knowledge gaps, as well as
   experimental approaches and areas of research in which future studies
   are likely to yield useful results. A particular focus of this article
   is to improve the representation of the ways in which biological
   processes complement physical and chemical processes that mobilise
   mineral elements, making them available for plant uptake. This is
   necessary to produce better estimates of weathering that are required
   for sustainable management of forests in a post-fossil-fuel economy.
   While there are abundant examples of nanometre- and micrometre-scale
   physical interactions between microorganisms and different minerals,
   opinion appears to be divided with respect to the quantitative
   significance of these observations for overall weathering. Numerous in
   vitro experiments and microcosm studies involving plants and their
   associated microorganisms suggest that the allocation of plant-derived
   carbon, mineral dissolution and plant nutrient status are tightly
   coupled, but there is still disagreement about the extent to which these
   processes contribute to field-scale observations. Apart from providing
   dynamically responsive pathways for the allocation of plant-derived
   carbon to power dissolution of minerals, mycorrhizal mycelia provide
   conduits for the long-distance trans-portation of weathering products
   back to plants that are also quantitatively significant sinks for
   released nutrients. These mycelial pathways bridge heterogeneous
   substrates, reducing the influence of local variation in C : N ratios.
   The production of polysaccharide matrices by biofilms of interacting
   bacteria and/or fungi at interfaces with mineral surfaces and roots
   influences patterns of production of antibiotics and quorum sensing
   molecules, with concomitant effects on microbial community structure,
   and the qualitative and quantitative composition of mineral-solubilising
   compounds and weathering products.
   Patterns of carbon allocation and nutrient mobilisation from both
   organic and inorganic substrates have been studied at larger spatial and
   temporal scales, including both ecosystem and global levels, and there
   is a generally wider degree of acceptance of the ``systemic{''} effects
   of microorganisms on patterns of nutrient mobilisation. Theories about
   the evolutionary development of weathering processes have been advanced
   but there is still a lack of information connecting processes at
   different spatial scales. Detailed studies of the liquid chemistry of
   local weathering sites at the micrometre scale, together with upscaling
   to soil-scale dissolution rates, are advocated, as well as new
   approaches involving stable isotopes.}},

   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi dynamics in Araucaria angustifolia forest}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{460}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Intensive logging of Araucaria angustifolia has reduced the extension of
   Araucaria-dominated forests, causing a strong disturbance on the
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community. AMF play an important
   role in soil health and Araucaria forest establishment. However, the
   main drivers that determine the AMF dynamics in native and reforested
   areas remain poorly understood. Our study aimed at evaluating important
   factors (i.e. soil and litter characteristics, seasonality and
   reforestation practices) that can alter AMF community dynamics. We
   evaluated three regions of Araucaria forest located in Sao Paulo state,
   Brazil, including native and reforested sites. We evaluated the AMF
   community through soil spore extraction and identification and root
   colonization rates, and we compiled the data using correlations and
   diversity metrics (richness, abundance and diversity). Together, we
   recorded thirty-six AMF species during the two sampling periods at all
   sites. Genera with the greatest numbers of species were Gloms,
   Acaulospora, Scutellospora and Gigaspora. Soil macroporosity, K and P
   were always higher in native forests and moisture was higher in
   reforested sites. Root colonization, though also affected by
   seasonality, showed differential behavior for each region. In addition,
   AMF species abundance changed between native and reforested sites and
   according to the season. In region 1, when correlating AMF and
   physical-chemical soil and litter attributes in a Redundancy Analysis,
   there were few differences between native and reforested sites, both
   being very similar. However, native and reforested sites were clearly
   discriminated in the other two regions, mainly influenced by bulk
   density, litter N, pH, Al, total porosity and moisture. The main
   influence in AMF dynamics composition were litter physical and chemical
   attributes. However, the reforestation process and seasonality,
   especially in summer, contributed to discriminate regions, indicating
   the relevance of these aspects on the AMF profile, reinforcing the
   importance of integrating tools in the evaluation of the biological data
   set.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon and mineral cycling in sustainable forest systems depends on a
   microbiome of basidiomycetes, ascomycetes, litter-degrading saprobes,
   ectomycorrhizal, and mycoparasitic fungi that constitute a deadwood
   degrading consortium. The brown rot basidiomycete Fomitopsis pinicola
   (Swartz: Fr.) P. Karsten (Fp), as an oxalate-producing facultative
   pathogen, is an early colonizer of wounded trees and fresh deadwood. It
   replaces basidiomycetous white rot fungi and non-basidiomycetous fungal
   phyla in the presence of its volatilome, but poorly in its absence. With
   the goal of determining its dominance over the most competitive
   basidiomycetes and its role in fungal successions within the forest
   microbiome in general, Fp was exposed to the white rot fungus
   Kuehneromyces mutabilis (Schaeff.: Fr.) Singer \& Smith (Km) in aseptic
   dual culture established on fertilized 100 mm-long wood dust columns in
   glass tubes with the inclusion of their volatilomes. For the mycelia
   approaching from the opposite ends of the wood dust columns, the
   energy-generating systems of laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP), the
   virulence factor oxalate, and the exhalation of terpenes were determined
   by spectrophotometry, High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and
   Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Km mycelia perceived the
   approaching Fp over 20 mm of non-colonized wood dust, reduced the
   laccase activity to 25\%, and raised MnP to 275\%-500\% by gaining
   energy and presumably by controlling oxalate, H2O2, and the dropping
   substrate pH caused by Fp. On mycelial contact, Km stopped Fp, secured
   its substrate sector with 4 mm of an impermeable barrier region during
   an eruption of antimicrobial bisabolenes, and dropped from the invasion
   mode of substrate colonization into the steady state mode of low
   metabolic and defensive activity. The approaching Fp raised the oxalate
   production throughout to >20 g kg(-1) to inactivate laccase and caused,
   with pH 1.4-1.7, lethal conditions in its substrate sector whose
   physiological effects on Km could be reproduced with acidity conditions
   incited by HCl. After a mean lag phase of 11 days, Fp persisting in a
   state of high metabolic activity overgrew and digested the debilitated
   Km thallus and terminated the production of oxalate. It is concluded
   that the factors contributing to the competitive advantage of F.
   pinicola in the colonization of wounded trees and pre-infected deadwood
   are the drastic long-term acidification of the timber substrate, its own
   insensitivity to extremely low pH conditions, its efficient control of
   the volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes of timber and microbial origin,
   and the action of a undefined blend of terpenes and allelopathic
   substances.}},

Abstract = {{Prior to the 1950s, common partial harvesting operations in the southern
   Appalachians USA involved the removal of logs by ground-skidding and the
   construction of steep access roads and skid trails along stream
   channels. Little is known about how these historical practices affected
   long-term vegetation changes. An experimental watershed in the Coweeta
   Hydrologic Laboratory was partially harvested in the years 1942-1952
   according to these exploitive practices. We compared the partial-cut
   watershed to a clear-cut watershed and an untreated, reference
   watershed. Using long-term vegetation surveys, we analyzed patterns in
   aboveground biomass accumulation, species composition and diversity
   (Shannon's index HMODIFIER LETTER PRIME and species richness) among
   watersheds. Contrary to our expectations, the partial-cut watershed
   recovered to reference levels of aboveground biomass and their species
   composition was similar over time. The clear-cut watershed had greater
   abundance of tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black locust
   (Robinia pseudoacacia) than the other two watersheds. The partial-cut
   watershed increased in diversity over time, but it remained less diverse
   than the reference watershed; whereas, the clear-cut watershed had lower
   diversity than the other two watersheds, and its diversity did not
   change over time. Distributions of functional groups based on water use
   and nutrient acquisition traits, and shade tolerance were similar
   between the partial-cut and the reference watersheds, but differed from
   the clear-cut watershed. By the 2010s, partial-cut and reference
   watersheds had similar proportions of diffuse-porous (32\% and 33\%) and
   ring-porous (48\% and 42\%) basal area, while the clear-cut watershed
   had more diffuse-porous (43\%) and less ring-porous (36\%) species than
   the partial-cut or reference watersheds. Tree species associated with
   arbuscular mycorrhiza were more abundant in the clear-cut watershed than
   the partial-cut or reference watersheds. Overall, the partial-cut
   watershed, even with the extreme soil disturbance, did not alter
   long-term species composition and diversity as dramatically as the
   clear-cut watershed. These results could help forest managers,
   conservationists, and hydrologists understand the long-term effects of
   partial-cutting versus clear-cutting.}},

   declines in the contribution of fungal residues to SOC and the ratio of
   fungal to bacterial residues. The fungi:bacteria ratio increased in P
   and N\&P addition plots while the fungal residue:bacterial residue ratio
   was decreased by P addition, which may be related to an imbalance in
   microbial residue decomposition. Both extracellular enzyme activities

   Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) OTU richness, Shannon-Weiner index

   ages (19 and 24 years) in multivariate space. In contrast, structural
   differentiation in the AMF community colonising the single plant-host

   although community composition and structure were heterogeneous within
   3-11 years but similar within 15-24 years. Seven Glomeromycotan genera
   were detected in soil and roots, including the relatively dominant
   Glomus genus, and the differentially abundant Acaulospora, Diversispora,
   Paraglomus and Scutellospora in either earlier or later years since
   post-mining reclamation. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that
   nitrates (NO3-N), clay content and bulk density significantly influenced
   (P < 0.05) the AMF community structure in soil, whereas, the AMF
   community in root was not significantly influenced (P > 0.05) by
   environmental variables. Overall, the study suggests that AMF community

   a minimum dataset for monitoring ecosystem restoration following

   biochar addition, maintained xylem water potential (XWP) of needles for
   up to 2 weeks without irrigation, independent of litter addition. As
   biochar increased relative fine root biomass (fine root biomass/total
   root biomass), it can be considered that biochar was able to maintain
   needle XWP through increasing the relative amount of fine roots that can
   obtain water. Overall, these findings suggest that biochar application
   can help to maintain water relations of Japanese black pine by enhancing

Abstract = {{Forest management practices, such as selection or mixing of particular

   retained in the canopy and smaller accumulation of C and N in the humus
   in the spruce compared to pine stands. The C sinks in aboveground tree
   biomass and soil were larger in the pine compared to spruce stands at
   this site. In addition, a significantly higher soil CO2 efflux rate and
   fineroot biomass in the spruce compared to pine stands suggested greater
   tree internal allocation of C belowground to roots and ectomycorrhizal
   fungi in response to stronger N limitation. We found no significant
   mixing effect in the mixed stands, given the levels of the measured
   variables did not exceed levels of the most productive monoculture, with
   an exception of higher SOC stocks in the deeper (10-20 cm) mineral soil
   layer in the mixed stands. Our results do not support the idea of higher
   productivity and C sinks of forest mixtures compared to the best
   performing monoculture on the given site suggesting that these tree
   species are not complementary from a forest management perspective.
   However, in many cases the mixed stands performed equally well as the
   best monoculture, indicating that management for multi-species stands
   may not result in any loss in C uptake and storage.}},

Abstract = {{We observed strong positive relationships between soil properties and
   forest dynamics of growth and mortality across twelve primary lowland
   tropical forests in a phosphorus-poor region of the Guiana Shield.
   Average tree growth (diameter at breast height) increased from 0.81 to
   2.1mmyr(-1) along a soil texture gradient from 0 to 67\% clay, and
   increasing metal-oxide content. Soil organic carbon stocks in the top
   30cm ranged from 30 to 118 tons C ha(-1), phosphorus content ranged from
   7 to 600mgkg(-1) soil, and the relative abundance of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi ranged from 0 to 50\%, all positively correlating with
   soil clay, and iron and aluminum oxide and hydroxide content. In
   contrast, already low extractable phosphorus (Bray P) content decreased
   from 4.4 to <0.02mgkg(-1) in soil with increasing clay content. A
   greater prevalence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in more clayey
   forests that had higher tree growth and mortality, but not biomass,
   indicates that despite the greater investment in nutrient uptake
   required, soils with higher clay content may actually serve to sustain
   high tree growth in tropical forests by avoiding phosphorus losses from
   the ecosystem. Our study demonstrates how variation in soil properties
   that retain carbon and nutrients can help to explain variation in
   tropical forest growth and mortality, but not biomass, by requiring
   niche specialization and contributing to biogeochemical diversification
   across this region.}},

Abstract = {{Mycoheterotrophic plants depend entirely on fungal associations for
   organic nutrients. While most mycoheterotrophic plants are associated
   with the mycorrhizal partners of surrounding green plants, some
   mycoheterotrophs are believed to obtain carbon from decaying litter or
   dead wood by parasitising saprotrophic fungi, based on culture
   experiments and C-13 and N-15 isotopic signatures.
   The carbon age (the time since carbon was fixed from atmospheric CO2 by
   photosynthesis) can be estimated by measuring the concentration of C-14
   arising from the bomb tests of the 1950s and 1960s. Given that
   mycorrhizal fungi obtain photosynthate from their plant partners, and
   saprotrophic wood-decaying fungi obtain carbon from older sources,
   radiocarbon could represent a new and powerful tool to investigate
   carbon sources of mycoheterotrophic plants.
   We showed that the Delta C-14 values of mycoheterotrophs exploiting
   ectomycorrhizal fungi were close to 0 parts per thousand, similar to
   those of autotrophic plants. By contrast, the Delta C-14 values of
   mycoheterotrophs exploiting saprotrophic fungi ranged from 110.7 parts
   per thousand to 324.8 parts per thousand, due to the C-14-enriched bomb
   carbon from dead wood via saprotrophic fungi.
   Our study provides evidence supporting that some mycoheterotrophic
   orchids depend on forest woody debris. Our study also indicates that
   radiocarbon could be used to predict the trophic strategies of
   mycoheterotroph-associated fungal symbionts.}},

   comprising members of Agaricales and Polyporales. Phosphorus, clay
   contents, and base saturation in soils strongly varied across plots and
   shaped the richness and composition of tree communities. The latter
   composition explained 23\% of the variation in the composition of

Abstract = {{Understanding the post-senescent fate of fungal mycelium is critical to

   bicolor, in paired wood and soil plots in a boreal forest in northern
   Minnesota, USA. Mass loss was quantified at four time points over an
   8-week incubation and the richness and composition of the fungal
   communities colonizing fungal necromass were characterized using
   high-throughput sequencing. We found that the structure of fungal
   decomposer communities in wood and soil differed, but, in both habitats,
   there was relatively rapid decay (similar to 30\% remaining after 56
   days). Mass loss was significantly faster in soil and for high-quality
   (i.e. high nitrogen and low melanin) fungal necromass. In both habitats,
   there was a clear trajectory of early colonization by opportunistic
   fungal taxa followed by colonization of fungi with greater enzymatic
   capacities to degrade more recalcitrant compounds, including white-rot
   and ectomycorrhizal fungi. Collectively, our results indicate that

   stocks, root and mycorrhizal productivity and fungi:bacteria ratios at
   fine spatial scales along 3 m transects extending radially from mountain
   birch trees in a sub-Arctic ecotone forest. Root and mycorrhizal
   productivity was quantified using in-growth techniques and

   associated mycorrhizal networks of B. pubescens. Individual trees exert
   influence substantially away from their base, creating more uniform

   Beetle Infestation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{As the range of bark beetles expands into new forests and woodlands, the
   need to understand their effects on multiple trophic levels becomes
   increasingly important. To date, much attention has been paid to the
   aboveground processes affected by bark beetle infestation, with a focus
   on photoautotrophs and ecosystem level processes. However, indirect
   effects of bark beetle on belowground processes, especially the
   structure and function of soil microbiota remains largely a black box.
   Our study examined the impacts of bark beetle-induced tree mortality on
   soil microbial community structure and function using high-throughput
   sequencing of the soil bacterial and fungal communities and measurements
   of extracellular enzyme activities. The results suggest bark beetle
   infestation affected edaphic conditions through increased soil water
   content, pH, electrical conductivity, and carbon/nitrogen ratio and
   altered bulk and rhizosphere soil microbial community structure and
   function. Finally, increased enzymatic activity suggests heightened
   microbial decomposition following bark beetle infestation. With this
   increase in enzymatic activity, nutrients trapped in organic substrates
   may become accessible to seedlings and potentially alter the trajectory
   of forest regeneration. Our results indicate the need for incorporation
   of microbial processes into ecosystem level models.
   IMPORTANCE Belowground impacts of bark beetle infestation have not been
   explored as thoroughly as their aboveground counterparts. In order to
   accurately model impacts of bark beetle-induced tree mortality on carbon
   and nutrient cycling and forest regeneration, the intricacies of soil
   microbial communities must be examined. In this study, we investigated
   the structure and function of soil bacterial and fungal communities
   following bark beetle infestation. Our results show bark beetle
   infestation to impact soil conditions, as well as soil microbial
   community structure and function.}},

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fine roots account for a substantial proportion of
   forest production and their decomposition releases large amounts of
   nutrients to the soil ecosystem. However, little is known about the
   fungi involved in ECM decomposition, including assemblages of fungal
   saprotrophs, endophytes, and the ECM fungi themselves. To follow fungal
   succession during the degradation of senescing fine roots, understory
   seedlings of Abies balsamea and Picea rubens at two sites in the Acadian
   forest of Nova Scotia were either severed at the root collar or left as
   controls. Root systems were collected sequentially over two growing
   seasons and assessed for fine root loss and ECM mantle integrity. ECM
   were identified by ITS-PCR and grouped into broad morphological
   categories. Fungal communities colonizing the senescing fine roots were
   also monitored by systematically constructing clone libraries over the
   course of the experiment. ECM with cottony, weakly pigmented mantles
   (e.g., Cortinarius) degraded within the first year. Those with cottony,
   but intensely pigmented mantles (Piloderma), and smooth mantles with
   weak pigmentation (Russulaceae) degraded more slowly. Smooth, melanized
   ECM (Cenococcum and Tomentella) generally maintained integrity over the
   course of the experiment. Rates of fine root loss and changes in ECM
   mantle integrity were positively correlated with soil temperature. ECM
   DNA was detected throughout the experiment, and was not replaced by that
   of saprotrophic species during the two seasons sampled. However, fungal
   root endophytes (e.g., Helotiaceae) initially increased in abundance and
   then decreased as mantles degraded, suggesting a possible role in ECM

Abstract = {{Purpose The aim of the study was to compare the activity, functional
   diversity, and community-level physiological profiles of soil
   microorganisms in light of soil physical and chemical properties in
   areas where a forest was damaged by hurricane-force winds and in
   untouched spruce forests of the lower montane belt of the Tatra
   Mountains (the Carpathians). Materials and methods Foehn winds caused a
   huge windfall in December 2013. The studied valley was strongly affected
   by windthrow, but in some places, patches of mature forest did survive.
   In the studied windthrow area, the first stage of secondary succession
   can now be observed. Sampling sites were selected in places where the
   soil was not mechanically disturbed. Soil samples were taken from the
   organic O and humus A soil horizons and basic soil properties were
   measured, as were the microbial parameters. Overall microbial activity
   was determined via the soil respiration rate (R), whereas the microbial
   biomass was determined via the substrate-induced respiration rate (SIR).
   Bacterial and fungal catabolic activity, functional diversity (H `), and
   community-level physiological profiles (CLPP) were determined using
   Biolog (R) ECO and FF plates, respectively. Results and discussion
   Research has shown that 21 months following the studied windthrow, in
   Hypereutric Skeletic Cambisols developed on calcareous parent material,
   changes have occurred in some soil properties: soil field moisture in O
   and A horizons has increased, DOC concentration in O horizons has
   decreased, and the C/N ratio in A horizons has decreased. The effect of
   the windthrow episode on overall biological activity was observed in
   soil A horizons, where overall microbial respiration and SIR biomass
   decreased. In both O and A horizons, the ratio of bacterial and fungal
   functional activity (AUC(bact/fungi)) increased as a result of a fungal
   AUC decrease. Significant differences in substrate utilization by
   bacteria occurred between forest-covered soils and windthrow soils in O
   horizons, where the share of polymer-utilized bacteria activity
   increased. Conclusions Rapid effects of windfall on soil microbial
   parameters expressed mostly in decrease overall microbial activity
   caused by breakdown in fungal activity. However, those differences are
   more pronounced in A than in O horizons. In spite of changes in those
   differences, windthrow did not produce a significant effect on the
   functional diversity index of microorganisms found in the studied soils.}},

Abstract = {{Biotically-mediated weathering helps to shape Earth's surface. For
   example, plants expend carbon (C) to mobilize nutrients in forms whose
   relative abundances vary with depth. It thus is likely that trees'
   nutrient acquisition strategies-their investment in rooting systems and
   exudates-may function differently following disturbance-induced changes
   in depth of rooting zones and soil nutrient stocks. These changes may
   persist across centuries. We test the hypothesis that plant C allocation
   for nutrient acquisition is depth dependent as a function of rooting
   system development and relative abundances of organic vs. mineral
   nutrient stocks. We further posit that patterns of belowground C
   allocation to nutrient acquisition reveal anthropogenic signatures
   through many decades of forest regeneration. To test this idea, we
   examined fine root abundances and rooting system C in organic acid
   exudates and exo-enzymes in tandem with depth distributions of
   organically- and mineral-bound P stocks. Our design permitted us to
   estimate C tradeoffs between organic vs. mineral nutrient benefits in
   paired forests with many similar aboveground traits but different ages:
   post-agricultural mixed-pine forests and older reference hardwoods. Fine
   roots were more abundant throughout the upper 2 m in reference forest
   soils than in regenerating stands. Rooting systems in all forests
   exhibited depth-dependent C allocations to nutrient acquisition
   reflecting relative abundances of organic vs. mineral bound P stocks.
   Further, organic vs. mineral stocks underwent redistribution with
   historic land use, producing distinct ecosystem nutritional economies.
   In reference forests, rooting systems are allocating C to relatively
   deep fine roots and low-C exudation strategies that can increase
   mobility of mineral-bound P stocks. Regenerating forests exhibit
   relatively shallower fine root distributions and more diverse exudation
   strategies reflecting more variable nutrient stocks. We observed these
   disparities in rooting systems' depth and nutritional mechanisms even
   though the regenerating forests have attained aboveground biomass stocks
   similar to those in reference hardwood forests. These distinctions offer
   plausible belowground mechanisms for observations of continued C sink
   strength in relatively old forests, and have implications for soil C
   fates and soil development on timescales relevant to human lifetimes. As
   such, depth-dependent nutrient returns on plant C investments represent
   a subtle but consequential signal of the Anthropocene.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of forest management on fungal diversity and community
   composition has been the subject of a wide number of studies over the
   last two decades. However, the difficulty of studying the complex
   kingdom of fungi under real forest conditions has led to rather
   scattered scientific knowledge. Here, we provide the current state of
   knowledge suggesting future research directions regarding (i) stand
   structure attributes (age, tree cover, stand density, tree species
   composition), (ii) management history (managed vs unmanaged), (iii)
   silvicultural treatments (thinning, clearcutting, shelterwood methods,
   selective cutting) and (iv) other anthropogenic disturbances (mushroom
   picking, salvage logging, prescribed burning, fertilization) affecting
   fungal diversity and community composition. The reviewed studies
   reported a positive correlation between fungal diversity and stand
   structure variables such as canopy cover, basal area of the stand and
   tree species diversity, particularly for mycorrhizal species. Abundance
   and diversity in size, tree species and decomposition stage of deadwood
   are reported as positively related to richness of wood-inhabiting fungi.
   The main findings about the effects of silvicultural practices suggest
   that the higher is the management intensity the lower is the diversity
   of ectomycorrhizal and wood-inhabiting species, at least in the short
   term. We have therefore reported those silvicultural practices which may
   reduce trade-offs between timber harvesting and fungal diversity
   conservation. Indeed, fungal diversity can be conserved in managed
   forests if (i) low impact logging operations are performed; (ii) stand
   structural complexity and late-successional forest characteristics are
   enhanced; (iii) deadwood amount and diversity is promoted, (iv)
   landscape heterogeneity and connectivity is improved or maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Soil phosphorus (P) availability and its distribution influence plant
   growth and productivity. To evaluate strategies that allow genotypes to
   be efficient under variable P environments, we planted six hybrid
   Populus deltoides clones belonging to the section Aigeiros (Aig), LL1,
   LL9, NL351, NL35, NL1388 and NL895, to three growth conditions in a
   greenhouse experiment, including low P, a high homogenous P supply and a
   high heterogeneous P supply. Functional traits, including foliar and
   root traits as well as rhizosphere processes, were measured. Large
   genotypic variation in shoot biomass and leaf P concentration was found
   in response to the P supply level and pattern. Compared with no P
   supply, LL1, LL9 and NL895 had a greater root length, biomass and P
   concentration in leaves under a homogenous P supply, while growth traits
   of NL351, NL35 and NL1388 were not significantly affected. A
   heterogeneous P supply enhanced the shoot biomass of LL1 and LL9. The
   root proliferation of LL1 and LL9 in P-rich patches was related to
   increased P acquisition in leaves. By contrast, a heterogeneous P supply
   did not enhance the biomass accumulation and the morphological
   plasticity of roots in other four genotypes, NL351, NL35, NL895 and
   NL1388, in P-rich patches. We found that functional traits or
   rhizosphere processes under low P could predict high P performance in
   Populus clones. Genotypes with a higher specific root length under low P
   can accumulate a larger biomass under a homogenous P supply. Conversely,
   high acid phosphatase concentrations decreased the positive impact of a
   heterogeneous P supply on a genotype's performance. Our results provide
   implications and applications for silviculture and forest management.}},

Title = {{Fungal diversity in peatlands and its contribution to carbon cycling}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{146}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Peatlands are major carbon sinks globally, but it is still unclear what
   drives their shift from functioning as carbon sink to a source. Fungi
   rely on soil carbon inputs and play an active role in carbon
   mobilization and stabilization. Future climate change scenarios predict
   increases in temperature and lower water tables, which may lead to
   functional shifts in fungal communities growing in peatlands. Despite
   their abundance, the impact of fungi on carbon cycling in peatlands is
   still poorly understood. Therefore, it is crucial to study the dynamics
   and distribution of fungal communities in pristine peatlands in order to
   predict the potential changes in peatland ecosystems more accurately.
   Here, we review the current knowledge about fungal communities in
   peatlands, including the influence of peatland type, abiotic factors,
   and temporal and spatial dynamics on fungal diversity. Our overview
   shows that fungal diversity in peatlands of certain regions such as
   tropical areas is severely understudied. Furthermore, we examine the
   ecological roles and the relative contribution to carbon cycling of
   functional guilds of fungi in peatlands, showing that saprotrophs are
   the key guild in organic matter decomposition, and ericoid- and
   ectomycorrhizal fungi have the ability to act as decomposers and vectors
   of plant carbon input to soil. We suggest that the application of a
   combination of methodological approaches for taxonomic and functional
   characterisation of peatland fungal communities is needed to build
   better understanding about the diversity-functioning relationships in
   peatland ecosystems. Overall, this review shows that fungi must be
   considered as important drivers of mechanistic processes underlying
   biodiversity, plant nutrient uptake and carbon losses in peatlands.}},

   mycorrhiza and ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Mycorrhizal fungi have considerable effects on soil carbon (C) storage,
   as they control the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), by
   modifying the amount of soil nitrogen (N) available for free-living
   microbes. Through their access to organic N, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi
   compete with free-living soil microbes; this competition is thought to
   slow down SOM decomposition. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi
   cannot decompose SOM, and therefore must wait for N to first be
   processed by free-living microbes. It is unclear what form of N the ECM
   fungi and free-living microbes compete for, or which microbial groups
   compete for N with ECM fungi. To investigate this, we focused on the N
   transformation steps (i.e., the degradation of high-molecular-weight
   organic matter, mineralization, and nitrification) and the microbes
   driving each step. Simple comparisons between AM forests and ECM forests
   are not sufficient to assert that mycorrhizal types would determine the
   N transformation steps in soil, because soil physiochemistry, which
   strongly affects N transformation steps, differs between the forests. We
   used an aridity gradient with large differences in soil moisture, pH,
   and SOM quantity and quality, to distinguish the mycorrhizal and
   physicochemical effects on N transformation. Soil samples (0-10 cm
   depth) were collected from AM-symbiotic black locust forests under three
   aridity levels, and from ECM-symbiotic oak forests under two aridity
   levels. Soil physicochemical properties, extractable N dynamics and
   abundance, composition, and function of soil microbial communities were
   measured. In ECM forests, the ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotic abundance
   was low, whereas that of ECM fungi was high, resulting in lower nitrate
   N content than in AM forests. Since ECM forests did not have lower
   saprotrophic fungal abundance and prokaryotic decompositional activity
   than the AM forests, the hypothesis that ECM fungi could reduce SOM
   decay and ammonification by free-living microbes, might not hold in ECM
   forests. However, the limitation of ECM fungi on nitrate N production
   would result in a feedback that will accelerate plant dependence on
   these fungi, thereby raising soil C storage through an increase in the
   ECM biomass and plant C investment in soils.}},

Abstract = {{Functional traits respond to environmental drivers, hence evaluating
   trait-environment relationships across spatial environmental gradients
   can help to understand how multiple drivers influence plant communities.
   Global-change drivers such as changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition
   occur worldwide, but affect community trait distributions at the local
   scale, where resources (e.g. light availability) and conditions (e.g.
   soil pH) also influence plant communities. We investigate how multiple
   environmental drivers affect community trait responses related to
   resource acquisition (plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), woodiness,
   and mycorrhizal status) and regeneration (seed mass, lateral spread) of
   European temperate deciduous forest understoreys. We sampled understorey
   communities and derived trait responses across spatial gradients of
   global-change drivers (temperature, precipitation, nitrogen deposition,
   and past land use), while integrating in-situ plot measurements on
   resources and conditions (soil type, Olsen phosphorus (P), Ellenberg
   soil moisture, light, litter mass, and litter quality). Among the
   global-change drivers, mean annual temperature strongly influenced
   traits related to resource acquisition. Higher temperatures were
   associated with taller understoreys producing leaves with lower SLA, and
   a higher proportional cover of woody and obligate mycorrhizal (OM)
   species. Communities in plots with higher Ellenberg soil moisture
   content had smaller seeds and lower proportional cover of woody and OM
   species. Finally, plots with thicker litter layers hosted taller
   understoreys with larger seeds and a higher proportional cover of OM
   species. Our findings suggest potential community shifts in temperate
   forest understoreys with global warming, and highlight the importance of
   local resources and conditions as well as global-change drivers for

Abstract = {{Understanding factors that regulate ecosystem responses to disturbances
   is a long-standing ecological goal and has been useful in predicting the
   effects of global change. The response of an ecosystem to a single
   perturbation does not necessarily predict its response to repeated
   perturbations-highlighting the `pulse' vs. `press' framework to predict
   ecosystem responses to single or recurring perturbations, respectively.
   This framework can help guide hypotheses around how ecosystems may, or
   may not, respond to changes in disturbance regimes. Here we apply the
   pulse-press framework to understand fire effects on soils and plant
   communities. Specifically, we combine a quantitative meta-analysis on
   the response of soil carbon and nutrients with a literature review of
   the response of microbial and plant communities. We argue that fire is a
   cumulative disturbance driving a `press' response and can be both
   coupled and decoupled from the `pulse' response to a single burn
   depending on whether the response variable is regulated by the direct
   effects of heating or the indirect effects of changing plant and
   microbial communities. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that carbon and
   nutrient content in mineral soils responded differently because carbon
   and nitrogen, which are volatilized to the atmosphere in a fire and turn
   over relatively slowly in soil, are regulated by the long-term losses of
   plant biomass inputs more so than heating-induced volatilization, and
   thus change relatively little in a single fire. Contrastingly, the
   elements calcium, potassium, and phosphorus, which are enriched in ash
   because of their resistance to volatilization, are regulated by the
   intermittent pulses into the soil following a fire. A literature review
   suggests microbial biomass and decomposition activity tended to decline
   after a single fire because of heat-induced mortality, which was
   consistent with the effects of repeated burning, likely due to combined
   effects of repeated heat-induced mortality and lower soil organic
   matter. Another important `press' response was how nutrient losses shape
   the nutrient use strategies of plants (tissue stoichiometry and nutrient
   acquisition strategy) and how changes in plant strategies influence soil
   responses. Past studies have generally found that species with low
   nutrient concentrations in biomass, high nutrient recycling before
   tissue senescence, and a greater reliance on mycorrhizal symbioses tend
   to increase in abundance with frequent burning. Many of these traits
   likely lead to slower decomposition and nutrient availability, but few
   studies have rigorously linked fire-driven shifts in traits with carbon
   and nitrogen cycling. The processes we have identified are likely to be
   especially important in tropical ecosystems, where disturbance by fire
   is shifting rapidly, attributable to changes in land use and climate.
   Tropical savannas are some of the most responsive landscapes to altered
   fire regimes, with large changes in soil carbon and nutrients,
   suggesting that shifts in fire regimes may change the carbon balance of
   these ecosystems substantially. We propose that more fire-manipulation
   experiments are needed in tropical forests, especially in moist forests
   where plants are not as well adapted to fire.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this investigation was to indicate the most effective
   method of revitalizing degraded forest area. The different modifications
   of wood chips were used as a substitute for humus layer. The mites
   (Acari), and moss mites (Oribatida) as the bioindicators of soil
   succession changes were used. The study began 2 years after planting of
   Scots pine seedlings on the land devastated by military activity, at the
   former military training ground (GPS: 53.156943N, 17.986440E). The soil
   on this area was in the type of rusty soils and subtype of the rusty
   algae soils. Scots pine seedlings were planted in spring 2011, in a
   distance 1.5x0.8 m. In one-factor experiment four soil mulching
   treatments were tested: 1. uncovered soil - control (C), 2. soil mulched
   with wood chips (W), 3. W + mycorrhizal preparation (WM), 4. W + forest
   litter (WL). Three replicates of microplots arrangement was applied.
   Each microplot was 5 m long with 3 rows of Scots pine. Each replication
   covers 10 rows. Mulching with wood chips was carried out on April 12,
   2012. On October 25, 2012, the wood chips on the WM microplots were
   inoculated with the mycorrhizal biopreparation, and on the WL
   microplots, a 10\% addition of fresh forest litter from the ripe fresh
   coniferous forest was applied. After the end of the growing season of
   2012, 2013 and 2014, the measurement of the plants was carried out (the
   height, the root neck diameter, the length of one-year increments in the
   last whorl, the number of one-year increments of the last whorl and the
   lengths of one-year increments of the last whorl). The samples for
   acarological tests were collected four times. In total, 40 substrate
   samples with a volume of 50 cm(3) each were collected from each
   treatment. Mites extraction was carried out for 7 days in Tullgren
   apparatus. Mites were identified to the order, and moss mites to the
   species or genus, including juvenile stages. Calculated: the average
   density of mites, the dominance index, the species richness, the
   diversity of moss mites, the average number of species, and the Shannon
   general species diversity index. The use of soil mulching with the Scots
   pine wood chips did not significantly affect the growth and
   developmental characteristics of the Scots pine plants. After mulching
   with wood chips, the total number of mites increased many times, and
   moss mites began to dominate among micro-arthropods. Mulching treatments
   increased the number and the species diversity of moss mites in the
   substrate. The number of moss mites increased the most in wood chips
   without additives. The highest species diversity was observed in the
   wood chips with the addition of forest litter. Among moss mites
   Tectocepheus velatus visibly dominated in all study treatments. Oppiella
   nova and Scutovertex sculptus also constituted numerous mites
   populations. The study shows that the wood chips are very useful for use
   in the regeneration of the devastated and degraded forest soils.}},

Abstract = {{Tree mortality from insect infestations can significantly reduce carbon
   storage in forest soils. In subarctic birch forests (Betula pubescens),
   ecosystem C cycling is largely affected by recurrent outbreaks of
   defoliating geometrid moths (Epirrita autumnata, Operophtera brumata).
   Here, we show that soil C stocks in birch forests across Fennoscandia
   did not change up to 8 years after moth outbreaks. We found that a
   decrease in woody fine roots was accompanied by a lower soil CO2 efflux
   rate and a higher soil N availability following moth outbreaks. We
   suggest that a high N availability and less ectomycorrhiza likely
   contributed to lowered heterotrophic respiration and soil enzymatic
   activity. Based on proxies for decomposition (heterotrophic respiration,
   phenol oxidase potential activity), we conclude that a decrease in
   decomposition is a prime cause why soil C stocks of mountain birch
   forest ecosystems have not changed after moth outbreaks. Compared to
   disturbed temperate and boreal forests, a CO2-related positive feedback

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Introducing exotic tree species for afforestation
   out of their natural range may alter the local ectomycorrhizal (ECM)
   fungal communities. The potential functional consequences shaped by
   exotic trees with recruited local ECM fungi rather than native trees
   remain unclear. This study examined (a) whether the composition and
   extracellular enzyme function of ECM fungal communities differed between
   native masson pine (Pinus massoniana) and exotic slash pine (Pinus
   elliottii) during seedling establishment; and (b) how differences in
   enzyme functioning were linked to the growth pattern of the host plants.
   Methods Native (masson) and exotic (slash) pine seedlings were planted
   into soil cores collected from each study site. At three months growth,
   root tips were collected from seedlings and assayed for ECM fungal
   community composition using high-throughput sequencing, and functioning
   using single root tip assays for enzymes associated with N, P and C
   acquisition. Results ECM fungi on masson pines showed higher activities
   of nitrogen- (N-acetylglucosaminidase, 280-300\%), phosphorus- (acid
   phosphatase, 105-152\%), and cellulose (beta-glucosidase, 204-235\%;
   cellobiohydrolase, 142-255\%) compound degrading enzymes compared to
   those on slash pines. Those differences was attributed to the
   host-specific performance of certain ECM fungal taxa, such as Rhizopogon
   spp. Information theory model selection showed that plant nutrient
   status in masson pines was correlated with the enzymatic contribution of
   Rhizopogon spp., whereas slash pines depended on a diverse enzyme
   palette from multiple ECM fungal taxa. Conclusions Host identity
   strongly influenced ECM fungal community composition and extracellular
   enzymatic functions of specific ECM fungal taxa, which could feedback to
   host establishment and nutrient cycling processes of restored ecosystem.
   Therefore, the origin of afforestation tree species should be an

Title = {{Does ectomycorrhiza have a universal key role in the formation of soil
   organic matter in boreal forests?}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{140}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Forest soil organic matter (SOM) is an important dynamic store of C and
   N, which releases plant available N and the greenhouse gases CO2 and
   N2O. Early stages of decomposition of recent plant litters are better
   known than the formation of older and more stable soil pools of N and C,
   in which case classic theory stated that selective preservation of more
   resistant plant compounds was important. Recent insights heighten that
   all plant matter becomes degraded and that older SOM consists of
   compounds proximally of microbial origin. It has been proposed that in
   boreal forests, ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF), symbionts of trees, are
   actively involved in the formation of slowly-degrading SOM.
   We characterized SOM in the mor-layer along a local soil N supply
   gradient in a boreal forest, a gradient with large variations in
   chemical and biological characteristics, notably a decline in the
   biomass of ECMF in response to increasing soil N supply.
   We found contrasting and regular patterns in carbohydrates, lignin,
   aromatic carbon, and in N-containing compounds estimated by solid-state
   C-13 and N-15 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These
   occurred along with parallel changes in the natural abundances of the
   stable isotopes C-13 and N-15 in both bulk SOM and extracted fractions
   of the SOM. The modelled ``bomb-C-14{''} age of the lower layers studied
   ranged between 15 years at the N-poor end, to 70 years at the N-rich end
   of the gradient. On average half the increase in delta C-13 with soil
   depth (and hence age) of the mor-layer can be attributed to soil
   processes and the other half to changes in the isotopic composition of
   the plant C inputs. There was a decrease in carbohydrates (O-alkyl C)
   with increasing depth. This supports the classical hypothesis of
   declining availability of easily decomposable substrates to
   microorganisms with increasing soil depth and age. The observed increase
   in delta C-13 with depth, however, speaks against the idea of selective
   preservation of more resistant plant compounds like lignin. Furthermore,
   from the N-poor to the N-rich end the difference between N-15 in plant
   litter N and N in the deeper part of the mor-layer, the H-layer,
   decreased in parallel with a decline in ECMF.
   The latter provides evidence that the role of ECMF as major sink for N
   diminishes, and hence their potential role in SOM stabilization, when
   the soil N supply increases. At the N-rich end, where bacteria dominate
   over fungi, other agents than ECMF must be involved in the large
   build-up of the H-layer with the slowest turnover rate found along the
   gradient.}},

Volume = {{140}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{While it has long been held that invasive plants alter ecosystem
   processes, the magnitude and direction of these effects have rarely been
   quantified in situ. We measured the effects of an invasive C-4 grass
   (Microstegium vimineum) on soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition in a
   deciduous forest in south-central Indiana, USA. The unique C-13
   signature of the C-4 grass relative to the C-3 trees allowed us to
   partition soil CO2 fluxes and estimate M. vimineum effects on
   decomposition. The magnitude and direction of priming effects hinged on
   the soil characteristics, which related to the mycorrhizal association
   of dominant trees. In forest plots dominated by ectomycorrhizal trees,
   with low nitrogen availability and most SOM in particulate (i.e.,
   unprotected) forms, M. vimineum increased SOM decomposition by 58\%. In
   contrast, in plots dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal trees,
   characterized by high nitrogen availability and most SOM in
   mineral-associated (i.e., protected) forms, M. vimineum decreased
   decomposition by 14\%. Collectively, our results demonstrate that
   invasive species can play a large role in altering ecosystem processes

Abstract = {{Background and aims Mycorrhizosphere is the interface between roots and
   soil where a myriad of microorganisms mediate plant growth, nutrient
   acquisition and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, and result in
   driving ecosystem biogeochemical cycling. Understanding the complexity
   and dynamics of mycorrhizosphere and its ecology and evolution are
   critical to enhancing forest productivity and ecosystem functioning,
   especially in high latitude temperate or high altitude alpine forests.
   However, the fungal community compositions and their driving ecological
   mechanisms of mycorrhizosphere during forest restoration are poorly
   documented. Methods In this study, we simultaneously examined the
   ectomycorrhizal (EM) and rhizospheric fungal communities of two dominant
   host tree species (Abies faxonianaandBetula albosinensis) in subalpine
   forest communities with distinct forest restoration stages (30- vs.
   60-year) after clear-cutting. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of internal
   transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences was adopted. Results A total of
   1222 EM and 5880 rhizosphere fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
   were obtained at a 97\% sequence similarity level, which were mainly
   dominated by Basidiomycota. Host identity and forest restoration stage
   had no significant effects on fungal species richness of both EM and
   rhizospheric fungi. However, the community assembly of EM and
   rhizospheric fungi was significantly different during forest
   restoration, with opposite patterns shown on ectomycorrhizae and
   rhizosphere. The EM fungal community assembly was significantly affected
   by host identity, stand age and population dynamic, while the
   rhizosphere fungal community was significantly structured by
   combinations of host trees biomass, soil properties and spatial
   distance. Conclusions Our data provide important insights that community
   assembly of EM and rhizosphere fungi may respond idiosyncratically
   during forest restoration, which will help us deeper understanding
   forest succession, stability and ecosystem functioning on the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.}},

Abstract = {{Soil respiration is the dominant pathway by which terrestrial carbon
   enters the atmosphere. Many abiotic and biotic processes can influence
   soil respiration, including soil microbial community composition.
   Mycorrhizal fungi are a particularly important microbial group because
   they are known to influence soil chemistry and nutrient cycling, and,
   because the type of mycorrhizal fungi in an ecosystem can be assessed
   based on the plant species present, they may be easier than other soil
   microbes to incorporate into ecosystem models. We tested how the type of
   mycorrhizal fungi-arbuscular (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (ECM)
   fungi-associated with the dominant tree species in a mixed hardwood
   forest was related to soil respiration rate. We measured soil
   respiration, root biomass, and surface area, and soil chemical and
   physical characteristics during the growing season in plots dominated by
   ECM-associated trees, AM-associated trees, and mixtures with both. We
   found rates of soil respiration that were 29\% and 32\% higher in AM
   plots than in ECM and mixed plots, respectively. These differences are
   likely explained by the slightly higher nitrogen concentrations and
   deeper organic horizons in soil within AM plots compared with soil in
   ECM and mixed plots. Our results highlight the importance of considering
   mycorrhizal associations of dominant vegetation as predictors of carbon
   cycling processes.}},

   indicators of woodland condition in the New Forest, UK}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{107}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Forests globally are facing an increasing number of threats from
   modified disturbance regimes, novel stressors and changing environmental
   conditions. This has ultimately resulted in declines in the ecological
   condition of many forest and woodland ecosystems, leading to widespread
   tree mortality and stand dieback. Effective indicators of overall
   woodland ecological condition are therefore needed for environmental
   monitoring and to support management responses. To test the
   effectiveness of different variables that could potentially be used as
   indicators of woodland condition, 102 variables that describe woodland
   structure, composition, functioning, edaphic conditions and disturbance
   regimes were assessed along 12 replicate gradients of beech stand
   dieback. Results indicated that 35 variables differed significantly
   between at least two stages of the dieback gradient, indicating their
   sensitivity to stand dieback. Seven of these indicators related to
   woodland species composition, two to functional processes, 20 to
   structural features, four to edaphic conditions, and two to disturbance
   regimes. These results demonstrate that effective indicators can
   potentially be identified for each of the ecological categories.
   Effective composition indicators included species richness of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi, ground flora and epiphytic lichens; functional
   indicators were soil respiration rate and net nitrification rate;
   edaphic conditions included soil Na:Ca ratio, exchangeable sodium, total
   carbon, Ca:Al ratio; structural indicators included canopy openness,
   litter cover, sward height, and volume of deadwood, and for disturbance
   the indicator was Equus dung density. Other measures, such as shrub
   cover and species richness of carabid beetles and spiders, were not
   found to vary significantly along the dieback gradients, and were
   therefore not identified as effective indicators. These results
   demonstrate the value of gradient analysis for evaluating indicators of
   woodland condition, but also highlight the need for multi-site studies
   to identify indicators with widescale applicability.}},

Abstract = {{Many forest soils are potassium (K) deficient, and Suillus species are
   common fungi in boreal pine forests that form ectomycorrhizal
   associations with trees. To select the ideal ectomycorrhizal fungi for
   improving the growth and K nutrition of trees in natural and artificial
   forests, the growth, oxalate efflux, K absorption and soil K depletion
   by 13 Suillus isolates were compared in pure liquid culture using soil
   as the sole K source. The growth of mycorrhizal Pinus massoniana Lamb.
   seedlings and the K extraction through extramatrical mycelia extending
   from the root surfaces were studied. The results showed that the tested
   Suillus species varied in growth rate and in the extraction of
   unavailable K from the soil. Their oxalate efflux may lead to the
   decomposition of K-bearing minerals and K release. The plants grown with
   added mycorrhizal fungi had higher biomass and extracted more K,
   particularly mineral structural K (HF-HClO4 digestible K), from the soil
   through the extramatrical mycelia than the seedlings grown without added
   mycorrhizal fungi. There was a positive correlation in K uptake between
   fungi grown in vitro and plants grown with mycorrhizae (R-2 = 0.717, n =
   8, p < .01). Therefore, in vivo tests on ectomycorrhizal fungal isolates
   can be used as a proxy to study the patterns and mechanisms of K
   extraction from the soil by extramatrical mycelia. Fungal K uptake in
   vitro could be one of the important indexes in the selection of Suillus
   for improving the growth and K nutrition of P. massoniana trees.
   Highlights
   Suillus isolates varied in their ability to extract unavailable K from
   soil. Oxalate was vital to the degradation of K minerals in soil by
   Suillus isolates. Pine seedlings with added mycorrhizal fungi from genus
   Suillus had larger biomass and K uptake than their non-mycorrhizal
   counterparts. Suillus isolates showed similar patterns in K uptake in
   vitro and when forming mycorrhiza.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between symbiotic ectomycorrhizal (EM) and free-living

   decomposition. While this phenomenon is widely cited, its generality
   remains unclear, as both the direction and magnitude of EM fungal
   effects on leaf litter decomposition have been shown to vary among
   studies. Here we explicitly examine how contrasting leaf litter types
   and EM fungal communities may lead to differential effects on carbon (C)
   and nitrogen (N) cycling. Specifically, we measured the response of soil
   nutrient cycling, litter decay rates, litter chemistry and fungal
   community structure to the reduction of EM fungi (via trenching) with a
   reciprocal litter transplant experiment in adjacent Pinus- or
   Quercus-dominated sites. We found clear evidence of EM fungal
   suppression of C and N cycling in the Pinus-dominated site, but no
   suppression in the Quercus-dominated site. Additionally, in the
   Pinus-dominated site, only the Pinus litter decay rates were decelerated
   by EM fungi and were associated with decoupling of litter C and N
   cycling. Our results support the hypothesis that EM fungi can decelerate
   C cycling via N competition, but strongly suggest that the `Gadgil
   effect' is dependent on both substrate quality and EM fungal community
   composition. We argue that understanding tree host traits as well as EM
   fungal functional diversity is critical to a more mechanistic
   understanding of how EM fungi mediate forest soil biogeochemical

Abstract = {{In boreal systems, soil profiles typically consist of distinct
   stratified horizons, with organic layers at the surface overlying deeper
   mineral horizons providing microhabitat variation along a depth

   structure in a coastal pine forest along a gradient of decreasing
   influence from the coast. In this system, the vertical stratification
   pattern of soil microhabitats (defined here as organic, mineral with

   non-uniform; organic horizons are sometimes buried under drifting sand
   dunes. Our results show that soil microhabitats are distinct with
   respect to physiochemical characteristics, community composition and OTU
   richness. While community composition was partly related to depth and
   distance from the coastal forest edge, microhabitat appeared to have the
   strongest influence. A closer inspection of the OTUs with the highest
   relative sequence abundance within each microhabitat revealed that
   microhabitats support functionally distinct fungal communities with

   under ambient N deposition (control) and after a decade of N addition at
   50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (N-plots) in an old-growth subtropical forest in

   one-year of N-15 addition in both the control and N-plots. The results

   access (or use) of deposited N among the plants. Decadal N addition had
   species-dependent effects on leaf delta N-15, suggesting the N
   acquisition patterns of these plant species are differently affected by
   N deposition. These results suggest that co-occurring plants in N-rich
   and subtropical forests vary in their N acquisition traits; these
   differences need to be accounted for when evaluating the impact of N

Abstract = {{Aims Net primary productivity is expected to increase in many forests as
   Earth warms, which can increase litter inputs to soils and affect carbon
   (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics. Understanding how increasing litter
   inputs affect soil C and N cycling in tropical and subtropical forests
   is important because they represent some of the most productive
   ecosystems on Earth, suggesting that small changes in these cycles can
   have large effects. Methods To test the effects of increased litter
   inputs and the interactive effect between microbes and roots on soil C
   and N stocks and dynamics, we manipulated litter inputs and used
   trenching to exclude roots in a 40-year-old Cunninghamia lanceolata
   Lamb. (Chinese fir) plantation. At the site, we measured soil C and N
   pools, soil C-13 and N-15 natural abundance, and potential activities
   for C-, N-, and phosphorus-acquiring enzymes. Results After four years
   of experimental treatment, we found that increasing litter inputs
   reduced total soil N content by 26\% relative to background litter
   inputs, but that increasing litter inputs did not affect soil C content
   in the plots with roots. In the plots without roots, both soil N and C
   did not change in response to litter inputs. In the plots with roots,
   soil delta N-15 increased with increasing litter inputs, but there was
   no effect in the plots without roots. We found a strong interactive
   effect between root and litter treatment on soil N pools and delta N-15.
   The decline in soil N pools and increase in soil delta N-15 were
   associated with elevated potential enzyme activity for N-acquisition
   (N-acetyl glucosaminidase). Conclusions Adding litter did not have a
   significant effect on soil C pools, likely because potential soil C
   losses were offset by increasing litter-derived C inputs. In contrast to
   C, adding litter decreased N availability, likely through multiple
   pathways including gaseous N losses, NO3- leaching, root N uptake, and
   interactions between saprotrophic microbes and roots during the
   four-year litter addition experiment. Global changes that increase
   litter production may lower N pools and imbalance C and N cycling in
   subtropical coniferous forest ecosystems.}},

   aboveground litter addition and root exclusion respectively caused 9\%

Volume = {{138}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Saprotrophic fungi are the dominant producers of organic
   matter-degrading extracellular enzymes in forest soils, but the extent
   to which they drive spatio-temporal variation in enzyme activities is
   unclear. We quantified the relationships between saprotrophic fungal
   biomass and enzyme activities in a mature temperate hardwood forest by
   placing soil-filled ingrowth bags inside trenches. Trenches were located
   in replicate stands (n = 7) dominated by either arbuscular mycorrhizal
   (AM)- or ectomycorrhizal (ECM)-associated tree species, which reflect
   differences in soil substrate quality and nutrient availability.
   Additionally, we assessed the extent to which the relationships between
   saprotrophic fungal biomass and enzyme activities varied across seasons
   and were altered by experimental nitrogen (N) addition. Overall, both
   fungal production and enzyme activities differed between mycorrhizal
   types and across seasons, but were unaffected by N addition.
   Additionally, enzyme activities exhibited strong, positive relationships
   with saprotrophic fungal biomass. However, the relative production of
   carbon (C)-degrading enzymes was greater in stands dominated by AM
   -associated trees in the late growing season, and the relative
   production of N-degrading enzymes was greater in the late growing season
   across both AM- and ECM-dominated forest stands. These patterns
   reflected tree- and season-driven changes in microbial C and N
   limitation. As such, while the common assumption that microbial biomass
   and enzyme activities are positively correlated is robust for
   saprotrophic fungi, enzyme produced per unit biomass may not be
   consistent among stands and across seasons.}},

Journal = {{GEODERMA}},

Volume = {{353}},
Pages = {{70-80}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) supports essential functions in terrestrial
   biomes and global biogeochemical cycles, and tropical tree plantations
   are often called upon to reverse deforestation-induced SOC loss. Yet the
   comparative efficacy of different plantation types and associated
   drivers of SOC restoration remain unclear. Theory suggests that higher
   chemical and spatial heterogeneity of plant litter should promote
   greater efficiency of soil microbial communities involved in SOC
   formation, so we hypothesised that more species-diverse tree plantations
   should be more effective in accelerating recovery of SOC. To test this,
   we compared developmental recovery of SOC and soil microbial communities
   between monoculture (Swietenia macrophylla King, mahogany) and highly
   diverse and mostly native species plantations (termed
   ``rainforestation{''}). All plantation types, which were aged 15 to 20
   years, only restored the composition of the soil microbial community to
   20-30\% of the reference, selectively logged old-growth rainforest.
   Contrary to our hypothesis, mahogany plantations, but not
   rainforestation, restored SOC and microbial function. Rainforestation
   shifted soil microbial composition and the composition of the understory
   vegetation closer to reference conditions. Soil microbial composition at
   all plantation sites was correlated with plant composition and
   functional traits, and better explained variation in SOC than land use.
   In particular, soil fungal PLFA biomass displayed a strong positive
   correlation with topsoil SOC concentration. This suggests that
   belowground restoration with tropical reforestation is slow relative to
   typical rotation times of tropical plantations (15-20 years). We
   conclude that reliable and rapid restoration of SOC may depend on
   interventions both above and below ground to re-instate the soil
   microbial community. This may require careful selection of plant species
   in combination with microbial inoculations.}},

   Stoichiometry}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) is central to soil carbon (C) storage and
   terrestrial nutrient cycling. New data have upended the traditional
   model of stabilization, which held that stable SOM was mostly made of
   undecomposed plant molecules. We now know that microbial by-products and
   dead cells comprise unexpectedly large amounts of stable SOM because
   they can become attached to mineral surfaces or physically protected
   within soil aggregates. SOM models have been built to incorporate the
   microbial to mineral stabilization of organic matter, but now face a new
   challenge of accurately capturing microbial productivity and metabolism.
   Explicitly representing stoichiometry, the relative nutrient
   requirements for growth and maintenance of organisms, could provide a
   way forward. Stoichiometry limits SOM formation and turnover in nature,
   but important nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur
   (S) are often missing from the new generation of SOM models. In this
   synthesis, we seek to facilitate the addition of these nutrients to SOM
   models by (1) reviewing the stoichiometric bias-the tendency to favor
   one element over another-of four key processes in the new framework of
   SOM cycling and (2) applying this knowledge to build a
   stoichiometrically explicit budget of C, N, P, and S flow through the
   major SOM pools. By quantifying the role of stoichiometry in SOM
   cycling, we discover that constraining the C:N:P:S ratio of
   microorganisms and SOM to specific values reduces uncertainty in C and
   nutrient flow as effectively as using microbial C use efficiency (CUE)
   parameters. We find that the value of additional constraints on
   stoichiometry vs. CUE varies across ecosystems, depending on how precise
   the available data are for that ecosystem and which biogeochemical
   pathways are present. Moreover, because CUE summarizes many different
   processes, stoichiometric measurements of key soil pools are likely to
   be more robust when extrapolated from soil incubations to plot or biome
   scale estimates. Our results suggest that measuring SOM stoichiometry
   should be a priority for future empirical work and that the inclusion of
   new nutrients in SOM models may be an effective way to improve
   precision.}},

Abstract = {{Research Highlights: Moderate thinning can effectively improve forestry
   production and change the microenvironment of understory vegetation.
   Background and Objectives: Microbial communities control the
   decomposition and transformation of forest organic matter; however, the
   influence of thinning on microbes in the organic horizon remains
   unclear. Materials and Methods: In this study, we subjected four plots
   of Chinese pine plantations in Badaling, Beijing to different thinning
   intensities, including no thinning (T0), low-intensity thinning (T10),
   medium-intensity thinning (T20), and high-intensity thinning (T50). The
   changes in chemical properties and microbial community compositions
   observed in the organic horizon, which comprised undecomposed litter (L
   layer) and half-decomposed litter (F layer), were analyzed after
   thinning. Microbial community compositions were evaluated using
   phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) methods. Results: The results showed that
   the abundances of gram-negative bacteria (GN) and total bacteria (B)
   under the T10 thinning condition were the highest among the four
   thinning intensities, and the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   (AMF) in T20 was higher than under other thinning intensities. The
   abundance of gram-positive bacteria (GP) and actinobacteria (ACT) in T10
   was lower than in both T0 and T50. The abundance of total PLFAs and
   fungi (FU) was higher in the L layer, whereas the abundance of GP, GN,
   B, ACT, and AMF was higher in the F layer. Conclusions: Our results
   demonstrated that the L layer better reflects the influence of thinning
   on litter. Redundancy analysis (RDA) results indicated that the organic
   carbon (LOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and ammonium nitrogen
   (NH4+-N)contents of litter were primarily responsible for the observed
   changes in microbial community structure, with LOC alone explaining
   62.6\% of the total variance among the litter substrate factors

Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The availability and the quality of substrates are important drivers of
   macrofungal biogeography, and thus macrofungal species occurrence is
   potentially dependent on the availability of different substrates.
   However, few studies have explored the properties of macrofungal
   substrates and assessed the relationship between macrofungal diversity
   and substrate diversity at a landscape level. To address this issue, we
   conducted a landscape-scale survey of basidiocarp substrates in the
   Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). A total of 957 macrofungal species
   distributed across 73 families and 189 genera were collected. Substrates
   of these macrofungi were categorized into four main groups (namely,
   litter, soil, root, and rare substrates) and referenced into 14
   sub-substrate types (such as branches, leaves, and fruit). The results
   revealed that 50\% of the observed macrofungal species were symbiotrophs
   living in ectomycorrhizal association with plant hosts, 30\% were
   saprotrophs decomposing plant litter, 15\% lived in soil organic matter,
   and 5\% lived in rare substrates. The most abundant root symbiotic fungi
   were members of Russula, whereas most litter saprotrophic fungi belonged
   to Marasmius. Macrofungi commonly favored a single substrate. This
   specificity was not affected by changes in vegetation or climate. Less
   than 1\% of macrofungi (e.g., Marasmius aff. maximus) could live on
   multiple substrates. Most of these unusual macrofungi were characterized
   as highly mobile and were generally found in successional areas. In
   secondary forests, our survey indicated that significant correlations
   exist between substrate preference and taxonomic diversity, reflected as
   higher substrate diversity generally accompanied by higher macrofungal
   diversity. In conclusion, substrate preference is an important factor
   driving macrofungal composition and distribution in the GMS. Macrofungi
   that thrive on multiple substrates constitute pioneer groups that have
   an important role in establishing macrofungal communities in new
   habitats. These observations have furthered our understanding of how
   substrate preferences could explain macrofungal biogeography.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims Agricultural abandonment has been taken as one of
   the most widely used strategies for ecological restoration. Abandoned
   croplands expanded worldwide since the middle of the twentieth century
   and will increase considerably in the future. Whether agricultural
   abandonment alters the abundances of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)
   mineralization genes, and whether these functional genes are linked to
   alterations in C and N mineralization rates remain unknown. Methods We
   took advantage of a well-established chronosequence of nature
   restoration sites on abandoned croplands which represent a century of
   vegetation succession in China's Qinling Mountains, to determine soil C
   and N mineralization rates, and their relationships with vegetation
   succession, edaphic characteristics, soil microbial communities, and
   functional genes based on GeoChip 5.0. Results We found that soil C and
   N mineralization rates, microbial biomass and composition, and the
   number and abundances of functional genes were significantly affected by
   vegetation succession following agricultural abandonment. Soil C and N
   mineralization rates increased by sixfold and threefold, respectively,
   along the cropland to forest successional gradient. The NO3-N, NH4-N and
   soil available phosphorus (P) concentrations were important factors
   associated with the C and N mineralization genes. The shifts in edaphic
   environments (i.e., soil moisture, cation exchange capacity, and C/P
   ratio), vegetation-derived substrates (i.e., soil organic C and N), and
   soil microbial composition (i.e., Fungi/Bacteria ratio, amounts of
   Gram-negative bacteria, Actinomycetes, and arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi), rather than the abundances of functional genes involved in
   mineralization processes, controlled soil C and N mineralization rates
   along the long-term vegetation successional gradient. Conclusions
   Abandoning cropland for natural succession could facilitate the
   recuperation of soil C and N processes and alter soil microbial
   composition and functional genes. The abundances of microbial functional
   genes are less important than previously expected in regulating soil C
   and N mineralization rates.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Ecologists have frequently observed a pattern of fungal succession
   during litter decomposition, wherein different fungal taxa dominate
   different stages of decay in individual ecosystems. However, it is
   unclear which biological features of fungi give rise to this pattern. We
   tested a longstanding hypothesis that fungal succession depends on the
   evolutionary history of species, such that different fungal phyla prefer
   different decay stages. To test this hypothesis, we performed a
   meta-analysis across studies in 22 different ecosystem types to
   synthesize fungal decomposer abundances at early, middle and late stages
   of plant litter decay. Fungal phyla varied in relative abundance
   throughout decay, with fungi in the Ascomycota reaching highest relative
   abundance during early stages of decay (P < 0.001) and fungi in the
   Zygomycota reaching highest relative abundance during late stages of
   decay (P < 0.001). The best multiple regression model to explain
   variation in abundance of these fungal phyla during decay included decay
   stage, as well as plant litter type and climate factors. Most variation
   in decay-stage preference of fungal taxa was observed at basal taxonomic
   levels (phylum and class) rather than finer taxonomic levels (e.g.
   genus). For many finer-scale taxonomic groups and functional groups of
   fungi, plant litter type and climate factors were better correlates with
   relative abundance than decay stage per se, suggesting that the
   patchiness of fungal community composition in space is related to both
   resource and climate niches of different fungal taxa. Our study
   indicates that decomposer fungal succession is partially rooted in
   fungal decomposers' deep evolutionary history, traceable to the
   divergence among phyla.}},

Abstract = {{Enrichment of forest soils with inorganic nitrogen (N) tends to inhibit
   oxidative enzyme expression by microbes and reduces plant litter and
   soil organic matter decomposition rates. Without further explanation
   than is currently presented in the scientific literature, we argue that
   upregulation of oxidative enzymes seems a more competitive response to
   prolonged N enrichment at high rates than the observed downregulation.
   Thus, as it stands, observed responses are inconsistent with predicted
   responses. In this article, we present a hypothesis that resolves this
   conflict. We suggest that high rates of N addition alter the competitive
   balance between enzymatic lignin mineralisation and non-enzymatic lignin
   oxidation. Using metatransciptomics and chemical assays to examine
   boreal forest soils, we found that N addition suppressed peroxidase
   activity, but not iron reduction activity (involved in non-enzymatic
   lignin oxidation). Our hypothesis seems positioned as a parsimonious and
   empirically consistent working model that warrants further testing.}},

Abstract = {{In grasslands, fire management and fertilization are established drivers
   of plant community change, but associated soil fungal responses are less
   well defined. We predicted that soil fungal communities would change
   seasonally, that decades of fire cessation and nitrogen (N)

   fungal community change would be correlated. Surface soils were sampled
   monthly for 1 y from a 30-y fire by fertilization experiment to evaluate
   fungal community dynamics and assess correlation with plant community
   heterogeneity. ITS gene community composition was seasonally stable,
   excepting increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal summer abundance in
   the burned, fertilized treatment. Long-term treatments affected soil
   fungal and plant communities, with correlated heterogeneity patterns.
   Despite woody encroachment in the fire cessation treatment, soil fungal
   communities did not resemble those of forests. This study provides

Abstract = {{Pyrogenic savannas with a tree-grassland `matrix' experience frequent
   fires (i.e. every 1-3 yr). Aboveground responses to frequent fires have
   been well studied, but responses of fungal litter decomposers, which
   directly affect fuels, remain poorly known. We hypothesized that each
   fire reorganizes belowground communities and slows litter decomposition,
   thereby influencing savanna fuel dynamics. In a pine savanna, we
   established patches near and away from pines that were either burned or
   unburned in that year. Within patches, we assessed fungal communities
   and microbial decomposition of newly deposited litter. Soil variables
   and plant communities were also assessed as proximate drivers of fungal
   communities. Fungal communities, but not soil variables or vegetation,
   differed substantially between burned and unburned patches. Saprotrophic
   fungi dominated in unburned patches but decreased in richness and
   relative abundance after fire. Differences in fungal communities with
   fire were greater in litter than in soils, but unaffected by pine
   proximity. Litter decomposed more slowly in burned than in unburned
   patches. Fires drive shifts between fire-adapted and sensitive fungal
   taxa in pine savannas. Slower fuel decomposition in accordance with
   saprotroph declines should enhance fuel accumulation and could impact
   future fire characteristics. Thus, fire reorganization of fungal
   communities may enhance persistence of these fire-adapted ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The negative impacts of non-native invasive plants on native plants has
   prompted intensive eradication efforts, but whether eradication can
   restore soil microbial communities that are also sensitive to invasion
   is generally not considered. Some invasive plants, like Alliaria
   petiolata (garlic mustard), specifically alter soils in ways that
   promote the invasion process. Garlic mustard disrupts mycorrhizas,
   increases fungal pathogen loads, and elevates soil nutrient availability
   and soil pH; thus, the fungal community and soil property responses to
   garlic mustard eradication may be key to restoring ecosystem function in
   invaded forests. We conducted a garlic mustard eradication experiment at
   eight temperate, deciduous forests. 1 and 3 years after initiating
   annual garlic mustard removal (hand pulling), we collected soil samples
   and characterized fungal community structure using DNA metabarcoding
   alongside a suite of edaphic properties. We found that fungal richness,
   the number of shared fungal species, fungal biomass, and the relative
   abundance of fungal guilds became less similar to invaded plots by year
   three of eradication and more similar to uninvaded reference plots.
   However, fungal community composition did not resemble uninvaded
   communities by the third year of eradication and remained comparable to
   invaded communities. Soil chemical and physical properties also remained
   similar to invaded conditions. Overall soil abiotic-biotic restoration
   was not observed after 3 years of garlic mustard removal. Garlic mustard
   eradications may therefore not achieve management goals until soil
   physical, chemical, and biological properties become more similar to
   uninvaded forested areas or at least more dissimilar to invaded
   conditions that can promote invasion.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal forest soils store significant amounts of carbon and are
   cohabited by saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM). The `Gadgil
   effect' implies antagonistic interactions between saprotrophic fungi and
   ECM. Plant photosynthates support the competitive fitness of the ECM,
   and may also shape the soil bacterial communities. Many `Gadgil effect'
   experiments have focused on litter layer (O-L) or have litter and
   root-fragments present, and thus possibly favor the saprotrophs. We
   compared how the restriction of plant roots and exudates affect soil
   microbial community structures in organic soil (mixed O-F and O-H). For
   this, we established a 3-yr field experiment with 3 different mesh
   treatments affecting the penetration of plant roots and external fungal
   hyphae. Exclusion of plant photosynthates induced modest changes in both
   fungal and bacterial community structures, but not to potential
   functionality of the microbial community. The microbial community was
   resilient towards rather short-term disturbances. Contrary to the
   `Gadgil effect', mesh treatments restricting the entrance of plant roots
   and external fungal hyphae did not favor saprotrophs that originally
   inhabited the soil. Thus, we propose that different substrate
   preferences (fresh litter vs. fermented or humified soil), rather than
   antagonism, maintain the spatial separation of saprotrophs and
   mycorrhizal fungi in boreal forest soils.}},

Abstract = {{Wood-inhabiting fungi (WIF) are pivotal to wood decomposition, which in
   turn strongly influences nutrient dynamics in forest soils. However,
   their dispersal mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that the
   majority of WIF are soil-borne. For this reason, the presented research
   aimed to quantify the contribution of soil as a source and medium for
   the dispersal of WIF to deadwood using high-throughput sequencing. We
   tested effects of tree species (specifically Schima superba and Pinus
   massoniana) on the percentage of WIF shared between soil and deadwood in
   a Chinese subtropical forest ecosystem. We also assessed the taxonomic
   and ecological functional group affiliations of the fungal community
   shared between soil and deadwood. Our results indicate that soil is a
   major route for WIF colonization as 12\%-15\% (depending on the tree
   species) of soil fungi were simultaneously detected in deadwood. We also
   demonstrate that tree species (p < 0.01) significantly shapes the
   composition of the shared soil and deadwood fungal community. The pH of
   decomposing wood was shown to significantly correspond (p < 0.01) with
   the shared community of wood-inhabiting (of both studied tree species)
   and soil fungi. Furthermore, our data suggest that a wide range of
   fungal taxonomic (Rozellida, Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota)
   and ecological functional groups (saprotrophs, ectomycorrhizal,
   mycoparasites, and plant pathogens) may use soil as a source and medium
   for transport to deadwood in subtropical forest ecosystem. While
   12\%-62\% of saprotrophic, ectomycorrhizal, and mycoparasitic WIF may
   utilize soil to colonize deadwood, only 5\% of the detected plant
   pathogens were detected in both soil and deadwood, implying that these
   fungi use other dispersal routes. Animal endosymbionts and lichenized
   WIF were not detected in the soil samples. Future studies should
   consider assessing the relative contributions of other possible
   dispersal mechanisms (e.g. wind, water splash, water dispersal, animal
   dispersal, and mycelial network) in the colonization of deadwood by soil

Abstract = {{Trait-based ecology claims to offer a mechanistic approach for
   explaining the drivers that structure biological diversity and

   to environmental change. However, support for this claim is lacking
   across broad taxonomic groups. A framework for defining ecosystem
   processes in terms of the functional traits of their constituent taxa
   across large spatial scales is needed. Here, we provide a comprehensive
   assessment of the linkages between climate, plant traits and soil
   microbial traits at many sites spanning a broad latitudinal temperature
   gradient from tropical to subalpine forests. Our results show that
   temperature drives coordinated shifts in most plant and soil bacterial
   traits but these relationships are not observed for most fungal traits.
   Shifts in plant traits are mechanistically associated with soil
   bacterial functional traits related to carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and
   phosphorus (P) cycling, indicating that microbial processes are tightly
   linked to variation in plant traits that influence rates of ecosystem
   decomposition and nutrient cycling. Our results are consistent with
   hypotheses that diversity gradients reflect shifts in phenotypic optima

Abstract = {{Boreal forests carry out functions that are critical to global
   biogeochemical cycling and climate regulation. Soil microbial diversity
   has been reported to drive multiple functions simultaneously
   (multifunctionality) in drylands and temperate ecosystems, however, the
   role and importance of bacterial and fungal diversity in driving
   multiple soil functions in boreal forest ecosystems remains poorly
   understood. We collected soils from 58 plots across upland and lowland
   (swamp) habitats in a boreal forest ecosystem to evaluate the linkages
   between fungal/bacterial diversity and multiple soil functions. Fungal
   and bacterial diversity were determined using 18S rDNA and 16S rDNA
   amplicons sequencing, and functions related to nutrient cycling
   (dissolved inorganic and organic nitrogen and carbon, nitrification) and
   climate regulation (CO2 and N2O emissions) were measured. The results
   showed that fungal but not bacterial richness was positively related to
   soil multifunctionality. We further used structural equation modelling
   to identify the effects of fungal and bacterial communities, and other
   environmental variables (moisture, pH, soil organic carbon and habitat
   types) on multifunctionality. Our model predicted 65.0\% of the
   variation in soil multifunctionality, and confirmed that along with
   moisture and habitats, fungal richness and community composition were
   significantly and positively associated with multifunctionality.
   Finally, we identified specific fungal genera strongly associated with
   soil multifunctionality, and saprotrophic fungi were especially
   important for maintaining multiple soil functions. Our results suggest
   that potential losses in fungal diversity could result in reductions in
   soil functions particularly linked to nutrient cycling and climate

Abstract = {{Understanding how extraradical mycorrhizal fungal hyphae (EMH) regulate
   the cycling and retention of plant-assimilated carbon (C) in forest

   combination with hyphal in-growth mesh bags ({''}in-growth bags{''}) was
   proposed in recent studies. However, poor knowledge on the decomposition
   of field-grown EMH prevents confirmation of assumed EMH decomposition

   density of field-grown EMH of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) over
   eight months in in-growth bags incubated in a warm-temperate
   Chamaecyparis obtusa forest, to study EMH decomposition under field
   conditions. We used exponential decay models to describe the changes in
   the decomposition rate of EMH over the incubation time, between EMH
   diameter classes, and between seasons. A rapid decrease of the
   decomposition rate of EMH within two months from 2.5 to 0.1 month(-1)
   was estimated, corresponding to an increase in half-life from 0.3 to 7
   months. Furthermore, significant differences in the initial maximum
   decomposition rate were estimated between fine (1.6 month(-1); minimum
   half-life: 0.4 months) and coarse EMH (3.1 month(-1); minimum half-life:
   0.2 months) and between incubations during spring-summer (April and
   August; 2.7 month(-1); minimum half-life: 0.3 months) and autumn-winter

   This large variability in the decomposition rates of EMH of AM fungi has

Abstract = {{Decomposition is a major flux of the carbon cycle in forest soils and
   understanding the involved processes is a key for budgeting carbon
   turnover. Decomposition is constrained by the presence of biological
   agents such as microorganisms and the underlying environmental
   conditions such as water availability. A metabarcoding approach of
   ribosomal markers was chosen to study the succession of bacterial and
   fungal decomposers on root litter. Litterbags containing pine roots were
   buried in a pine forest for two years and sequentially sampled.
   Decomposition and the associated communities were surveyed under ambient
   dry and long-term irrigation conditions. Early decomposition stages were
   characterized by the presence of fast-cycling microorganisms such as
   Bacteroidetes and Helotiales, which were then replaced by more
   specialized bacteria and litter-associated or parasitic groups such as
   Acidobacteria, white rots, and Pleosporales. This succession was likely
   driven by a decrease of easily degradable carbohydrates and a relative
   increase in persistent compounds such as lignin. We hypothesize that
   functional redundancy among the resident microbial taxa caused similar
   root decomposition rates in control and irrigated forest soils. These
   findings have important implications for drought-prone Alpine forests as
   frequent drought events reduce litter fall, but not litter
   decomposition, potentially resulting in lower carbon stocks.}},

Abstract = {{Both fungal and bacterial communities in soils play key roles in driving
   forest ecosystem processes across multiple time scales, but how seasonal
   changes in environmental factors shape these microbial communities is
   not well understood. Here, we aimed to evaluate the importance of
   seasons, elevation, and soil depth in determining soil fungal and
   bacterial communities, given the influence of climate conditions, soil
   properties and plant traits. In this study, seasonal patterns of
   diversity and abundance did not synchronize between fungi and bacteria,
   where soil fertility explained the diversity and abundance of soil fungi
   but soil water content explained those of soil bacteria. Model-based
   clustering showed that seasonal changes in both abundant and rare
   taxonomic groups were different between soil fungi and bacteria. The
   cluster represented by ectomycorrhizal genus Lactarius was a dominant
   group across soil fungal communities and fluctuated seasonally. For soil
   bacteria, the clusters composed of dominant genera were seasonally
   stable but varied greatly depending on elevation and soil depth.
   Seasonally changing clusters of soil bacteria (e.g., Nitrospira and
   Pelosinus) were not dominant groups and were related to plant phenology.
   These findings suggest that the contribution of seasonal changes in
   climate conditions, soil fertility, and plant phenology to microbial
   communities might be equal to or greater than the effects of spatial
   heterogeneity of those factors. Our study identifies
   aboveground-belowground components as key factors explaining how
   microbial communities change during a year in forest soils at

Abstract = {{Leaf-cutter ants are a prominent feature in Neotropical ecosystems, but
   a comprehensive assessment of their effects on ecosystem functions is
   lacking. We reviewed the literature and used our own recent findings to
   identify knowledge gaps and develop a framework to quantify the effects
   of leaf-cutter ants on ecosystem processes. Leaf-cutter ants disturb the
   soil structure during nest excavation changing soil aeration and
   temperature. They mix relatively nutrient-poor soil from deeper layers
   with the upper organic-rich layers increasing the heterogeneity of
   carbon and nutrients within nest soils. Leaf-cutter ants account for
   about 25\% of all herbivory in Neotropical forest ecosystems, moving
   10\%-15\% of leaves in their foraging range to their nests. Fungal
   symbionts transform the fresh, nutrient-rich vegetative material to
   produce hyphal nodules to feed the ants. Organic material from roots and
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi enhances carbon and nutrient turnover in
   nest soils and creates biogeochemical hot spots. Breakdown of organic
   matter, microbial and ant respiration, and nest waste material
   decomposition result in increased CO2, CH4, and N2O production, but the
   build-up of gases and heat within the nest is mitigated by the tunnel
   network ventilation system. Nest ventilation dynamics are challenging to
   measure without bias, and improved sensor systems would likely solve
   this problem. Canopy gaps above leaf-cutter ant nests change the light,
   wind and temperature regimes, which affects ecosystem processes. Nests
   differ in density and size depending on colony age, forest type and
   disturbance level and change over time resulting in spatial and temporal
   changes of ecosystem processes. These characteristics remain a challenge
   to evaluate rapidly and non-destructively. Addressing the knowledge gaps
   identified in this synthesis will bring insights into physical and
   biological processes driving biogeochemical cycles at the nest and
   ecosystem scale and will improve our understanding of ecosystem
   biogeochemical heterogeneity and larger scale ecological phenomena. A

Abstract = {{Ecosystem processes and the organisms involved are generally limited by
   the availability of one or more elements in soil, an important
   phenomenon to consider for our understanding of ecosystem functioning
   and future changes. Especially in tropical forests, typically growing on
   nutrient depleted soils, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) or other
   limitations are assumed. However, large-scale nutrient manipulation
   experiments revealed complex site-specific patterns and several authors
   raised the need for novel approaches to reveal deeper mechanistic
   insights on limitation patterns, especially concerning soil microbial
   activity. In order to gain such deeper knowledge, based on a short
   review of previous small-scale studies focusing on soil micro-organisms,
   we developed an experimental approach which controls for common biases,
   including indirect treatment effects, addition of co-elements or
   nutrient pulses. Using this technique, we tested the hypotheses that
   fungi growing in tropical forest soils are mainly limited by P and that
   N versus P limitations shift along an altitudinal gradient. Mesh bags of
   38 mu m filled with sand were amended with weak ion exchange resins
   loaded with N, P or potassium (K) and buried underneath the litter layer
   at three altitudinal sites in southern Ecuador. After a period of four
   months, the in-growth of fungal hyphae was quantified, phospholipid
   fatty acids were analysed for a subset of samples, and chemical
   properties were determined. In line with the first hypothesis, hyphal
   abundance was increased in P-amended mesh bags, indicating P limitation.
   However, this pattern was not significantly shifted along the
   altitudinal gradient. By contrast, N addition increased hyphal abundance
   at the lowest site, compared to significant reductions at 2,000 and
   3,000 m-not only in fungi but also in bacterial abundance as indicated
   by PLFA analyses, contradicting common soil-age hypotheses. Decreased
   nutrient immobilization and fungal in-growth at higher elevations
   suggest slow microbial activity, including nitrification, which may have
   caused toxic ammonium accumulation. The experimental design offers a
   promising tool to provide more mechanistic and soil-focused analyses
   specifically targeting microbes, which in this system strongly supported
   the hypothesis of primary fungal P limitation in tropical forest soils.

Title = {{What do we know about soil carbon destabilization?}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Most empirical and modeling research on soil carbon (C) dynamics has
   focused on those processes that control and promote C stabilization.
   However, we lack a strong, generalizable understanding of the mechanisms
   through which soil organic carbon (SOC) is destabilized in soils. Yet a
   clear understanding of C destabilization processes in soil is needed to
   quantify the feedbacks of the soil C cycle to the Earth system.
   Destabilization includes processes that occur along a spectrum through
   which SOC shifts from a `protected' state to an `available' state to
   microbial cells where it can be mineralized to gaseous forms or to
   soluble forms that are then lost from the soil system. These processes
   fall into three general categories: (1) release from physical occlusion
   through processes such as tillage, bioturbation, or freeze-thaw and
   wetting-drying cycles; (2) C desorption from soil solids and colloids;
   and (3) increased C metabolism. Many processes that stabilize soil C can
   also destabilize C, and C gain or loss depends on the balance between
   competing reactions. For example, earthworms may both destabilize C
   through aggregate destruction, but may also create new aggregates and
   redistribute C into mineral horizon. Similarly, mycorrhizae and roots
   form new soil C but may also destabilize old soil C through priming and
   promoting microbial mining; labile C inputs cause C stabilization
   through increased carbon use efficiency or may fuel priming. Changes to
   the soil environment that affect the solubility of minerals or change
   the relative surfaces charges of minerals can destabilize SOC, including
   increased pH or in the reductive dissolution of Fe-bearing minerals. By
   considering these different physical, chemical, and biological controls
   as processes that contribute to soil C destabilization, we can develop
   thoughtful new hypotheses about the persistence and vulnerability of C
   in soils and make more accurate and robust predictions of soil C cycling
   in a changing environment.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystems with ectomycorrhizal plants have high soil carbon : nitrogen

   between ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi for nitrogen slows litter
   decomposition, may increase soil carbon. However, experimental evidence
   for the Gadgil effect is equivocal. Here, we apply resource-ratio theory
   to assess whether interguild fungal competition for different forms of
   organic nitrogen can affect litter decomposition. We focus on variation
   in resource input ratios and fungal resource use traits, and evaluate
   our model's predictions by synthesizing prior experimental literature
   examining ectomycorrhizal effects on litter decomposition. In our model,
   resource input ratios determined whether ectomycorrhizal fungi
   suppressed saprotrophic fungi. Recalcitrant litter inputs favored the
   former over the latter, allowing the Gadgil effect only when such inputs
   predominated. Although ectomycorrhizal fungi did not always hamper
   litter decomposition, ectomycorrhizal nitrogen uptake always increased
   carbon : nitrogen ratios in litter. Our meta-analysis of empirical
   studies supports our theoretical results: ectomycorrhizal fungi appear
   to slow decomposition of leaf litter only in forests where litter inputs
   are highly recalcitrant. We thus find that the specific contribution of
   the Gadgil effect to high soil carbon : nitrogen ratios in
   ectomycorrhizal ecosystems may be smaller than predicted previously.}},

Abstract = {{Among plant traits, plant secondary metabolites such as tannins mediate
   plant-herbivore interactions but also have after-life effects on litter
   decomposition and nutrient cycling. We propose that niche construction
   mechanisms based on positive plant-soil feedback (PSF) could influence
   the evolution of tannin production. By modelling the flow of nitrogen
   (N) and carbon (C) through plants and soil in a spatially explicit
   context, we explored the relative contribution of herbivory and positive
   PSF as drivers of tannin evolution. We assumed soil N to be contained in
   labile and recalcitrant compartments, the latter made of tannin-protein
   complexes from which plants can absorb nutrients via associations with
   mycorrhizal fungi. In infertile environments and for plants with low
   biomass turnover rates, we show that when tannins modify soil properties
   locally, positive PSF alone can drive their evolution. We further
   predict the existence of positive coevolutionary feedback between
   associations with mycorrhizal fungi with a decaying ability and tannins,
   possibly triggered by the evolution of the latter as protection against
   herbivores. In line with our theoretical results, empirical evidence
   suggest that tannins are mostly present in plants with low tissue
   turnover, associated with mycorrhizal fungi able to decay organic matter
   and inhabiting infertile environments. Synthesis. Our model proposes
   that the evolution of tannin production can be triggered by positive
   plant-soil feedback, provided that tannins promote the local N retention
   and that mycorrhizal fungi associated with plants are able to absorb N
   from tannin-protein complexes. In our model, tannin production evolves
   only in infertile ecosystems, in agreement with field observations. Our
   findings highlight that the strength of niche construction depends on
   the ecological context, hence that global ecological properties
   constrain local eco-evolutionary dynamics.}},

Month = {{JUL 17}},
Abstract = {{Background. Soil microbial communities and their associated enzyme
   activities play key roles in carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems.
   Soil microbial communities are sensitive to resource availability, but
   the mechanisms of microbial regulation have not been thoroughly
   investigated. Here, we tested the mechanistic relationships between
   microbial responses and multiple interacting resources.
   Methods. We examined soil carbon properties, soil microbial community
   structure and carbon-related functions under nitrogen addition and plant
   inputs removal (litter removal (NL), root trench and litter removal
   (NRL)) in a pure Larix principis-rupprechtii plantation in northern
   China.
   Results. We found that nitrogen addition affected the soil microbial
   community structure, and that microbial biomass increased significantly
   once 100 kg ha a of nitrogen was added. The interactions between
   nitrogen addition and plant inputs removal significantly affected soil
   bacteria and their enzymatic activities (oxidases). The NL treatment
   enhanced soil microbial biomass under nitrogen addition. We also found
   that the biomass of gram-negative bacteria and saprotrophic fungi
   directly affected the soil microbial functions related to carbon
   turnover. The biomass of gram-negative bacteria and peroxidase activity
   were key factors controlling soil carbon dynamics. The interactions
   between nitrogen addition and plant inputs removal strengthened the
   correlation between the hydrolases and soil carbon.
   Conclusions. This study showed that nitrogen addition and plant inputs
   removal could alter soil enzyme activities and further affect soil
   carbon turnover via microbial regulation. The increase in soil microbial
   biomass and the microbial regulation of soil carbon both need to be
   considered when developing effective sustainable forest management
   practices for northern China. Moreover, further studies are also needed
   to exactly understand how the complex interaction between the plant and
   below-ground processes affects the soil microbial community structure.}},

Abstract = {{There is evidence that anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition enhances
   carbon (C) sequestration in boreal forest soils. However, it is unclear
   how free-living saprotrophs (bacteria and fungi, SAP) and
   ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi responses to N addition impact soil C
   dynamics. Our aim was to investigate how SAP and EM communities are
   impacted by N enrichment and to estimate whether these changes influence
   decay of litter and humus. We conducted a long-term experiment in
   northern Sweden, maintained since 2004, consisting of ambient, low N
   additions (0, 3, 6, and 12 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) simulating current N
   deposition rates in the boreal region, as well as a high N addition (50
   kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). Our data showed that long-term N enrichment
   impeded mass loss of litter, but not of humus, and only in response to
   the highest N addition treatment. Furthermore, our data showed that EM
   fungi reduced the mass of N and P in both substrates during the
   incubation period compared to when only SAP organisms were present. Low
   N additions had no effect on microbial community structure, while the
   high N addition decreased fungal and bacterial biomasses and altered EM
   fungi and SAP community composition. Actinomycetes were the only
   bacterial SAP to show increased biomass in response to the highest N
   addition. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of how
   anthropogenic N enrichment can influence soil C accumulation rates and
   suggest that current N deposition rates in the boreal region (<= 12 kg N

   Trees shape their surrounding by both leaf litter and roots generating

   leaf litter quality and root associated mycorrhizal symbionts, affect
   oribatid mite communities by shaping below- and aboveground resources

   microbial biomass and the amount of remaining litter mass. Although leaf
   litter species with higher nutritional values decomposed considerably
   faster, microbial biomass only slightly differed between leaf litter
   species. Neither root species nor leaf litter species affected
   abundance, species richness or community structure of oribatid mites.
   However, root species had an effect on the proportion of parthenogenetic

Abstract = {{Wildfire is the dominant disturbance in boreal forests and fire activity
   is increasing in these regions. Soil fungal communities are important
   for plant growth and nutrient cycling postfire but there is little
   understanding of how fires impact fungal communities across landscapes,
   fire severity gradients, and stand types in boreal forests.
   Understanding relationships between fungal community composition,
   particularly mycorrhizas, and understory plant composition is therefore
   important in predicting how future fire regimes may affect vegetation.
   We used an extreme wildfire event in boreal forests of Canada's
   Northwest Territories to test drivers of fungal communities and assess
   relationships with plant communities. We sampled soils from 39 plots 1
   year after fire and 8 unburned plots. High-throughput sequencing (MiSeq,
   ITS) revealed 2,034 fungal operational taxonomic units. We found soil pH
   and fire severity (proportion soil organic layer combusted), and
   interactions between these drivers were important for fungal community
   structure (composition, richness, diversity, functional groups). Where
   fire severity was low, samples with low pH had higher total fungal,
   mycorrhizal, and saprotroph richness compared to where severity was
   high. Increased fire severity caused declines in richness of total
   fungi, mycorrhizas, and saprotrophs, and declines in diversity of total
   fungi and mycorrhizas. The importance of stand age (a surrogate for fire
   return interval) for fungal composition suggests we could detect
   long-term successional patterns even after fire. Mycorrhizal and plant
   community composition, richness, and diversity were weakly but
   significantly correlated. These weak relationships and the distribution
   of fungi across plots suggest that the underlying driver of fungal
   community structure is pH, which is modified by fire severity. This
   study shows the importance of edaphic factors in determining fungal
   community structure at large scales, but suggests these patterns are
   mediated by interactions between fire and forest stand composition.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in carbon (C) inputs can augment soil organic matter (SOM), or
   reduce SOM by accelerating decomposition. Thus, there is a need to
   understand how and why ecosystems differ in their sensitivity to C
   inputs. Invasive plants that invade wide-ranging habitats, accumulate
   biomass rapidly, and contribute copious amounts of C to soil can be
   ideal for addressing this gap. We quantified the effects of the invasive
   C4 grass, Microstegium vimineum, on SOM in three temperate forests
   across plots varying in their relative abundance of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) versus ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees. We hypothesized
   that invasion would differentially affect SOM along the mycorrhizal
   gradient owing to recognized patterns in nitrogen availability (AM>ECM)
   and the proportion of unprotected SOM (ECM>AM). Across all sites, M.
   vimineum was associated with lower particulate organic matter (POM) in
   ECM-dominated plots, consistent with our hypothesis that invader-derived
   C inputs should stimulate decomposers to acquire nitrogen from
   unprotected SOM in soils with low nitrogen availability. However, the
   pattern of lower POM in the ECM-dominated soils was offset by greater
   mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM)-and isotopic data suggest this
   was largely driven by native- rather than invader-derived SOM-implying
   an invasion-associated transfer of native-derived POM into MAOM. Our
   results demonstrate a context-dependent shift in the form of SOM in a
   system with presumably enhanced C inputs. This finding suggests a need
   to look beyond changes in total SOM stocks, as intrinsic SOM changes
   could lead to important long-term feedbacks on invasion or priming
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{The roles of soil fungal diversity and community composition in
   regulating soil respiration when above- and below-ground plant carbon
   (C) inputs are excluded remain unclear. In the present study, we aimed
   to examine the following. (a) How does the exclusion of above- and
   below-ground plant C inputs affect soil respiration and soil fungi
   singly and in combination? (b) Are changes in soil fungal diversity
   aligned with changes in soil respiration? A field experiment with
   manipulation of plant C inputs was established in a subtropical forest
   in southwest China in 2004 with litter removal and tree stem-girdling to
   exclude inputs of the above- and below-ground plant C, respectively. In
   2009, we measured the rates of soil respiration with an infrared gas
   analyser and soil fungal community structure using Illumina sequencing.
   We found that the rates of soil respiration were reduced significantly
   by litter removal and girdling, by similar magnitudes. However, they
   were not decreased further by the combination of these two treatments
   compared to either treatment alone. In contrast, litter removal
   increased the diversity of soil fungal communities, whereas girdling
   decreased the abundance of symbiotrophic fungi but increased the
   abundance of saptrotrophic and pathotrophic fungi. These changes in soil
   fungal community might initiate CO2 emission from soil C decomposition,
   offsetting further decline in soil respiration when plant C inputs are
   excluded. These results revealed that the exclusion of the above- and
   below-ground plant C inputs led to contrasting soil fungal communities
   but similar soil function. Our findings suggest that both above- and
   below-ground plant C are important in regulating soil respiration in
   subtropical forests, by limiting substrates for soil fungal growth and
   altering the diversity and composition of the soil fungal community.

Journal = {{PEDOBIOLOGIA}},

Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{24-33}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{American chestnut (Castenea dentata), once dominant throughout the
   eastern deciduous forest of North America, was extirpated from its
   native range by chestnut blight fungus. Through development of
   blight-resistant trees, the reintroduction of chestnut is likely, though
   little is known about the biogeochemistry of forests influenced by
   chestnut. We performed a one-year laboratory incubation experiment with
   soil and litter from 10-year-old monoculture plantings of pure American
   chestnut, black cherry, and northern red oak, in addition to a
   field-based C-13 isotopic analysis of soil C. Parameters included litter
   decomposition, C respiration, N leaching, soil oxidizable C,
   extracellular enzyme activity related to nutrient acquisition, and
   litter chemistry. Results indicate that chestnut litter decayed more
   rapidly than that of oak or cherry (19.0\%, 10.8\%, 14.1\% mass loss in
   chestnut, oak, and cherry litter, respectively). Chestnut had lower N
   leaching rates than soils beneath oak or cherry (7.8, 11.5, and 12.0 mg
   N kg(-1) in chestnut, cherry, and oak soils, respectively), greater
   dissolved organic C (DOC) in leachate than soils influenced by oak (32.2
   and 26.4 mg kg(-1) in chestnut and oak soil, respectively). No
   differences in soil respiration or total soil C by species were
   detected. We conclude that surface soils influenced by chestnut have
   large inputs of C through rapid litter decomposition and low inorganic N
   availability, indicating potential for accumulation of C in surface soil
   over the long-term.}},

Abstract = {{Subtropical broadleaved forests play a crucial role in supporting
   terrestrial ecosystem functions, but little is known about their
   belowground soil fungal communities despite that they have central
   functions in C, N, and P cycles. This study investigated the structures
   and identified the drivers of soil fungal communities in subtropical
   deciduous and evergreen broadleaved forests, using high-throughput
   sequencing and FUNGuild for fungal identification and assignment to the
   trophic guild. Fungal richness was much higher in the deciduous than in
   the evergreen forest. Both forests were dominated by Ascomycota and
   Basidiomycota phyla, but saprophytic fungi were more abundant in the
   deciduous forest and ectomycorrhizal fungi predominated in the evergreen
   forest. Fungal communities had strong links to plant and soil
   properties. Specifically, plant diversity and litter biomass were the
   main aboveground drivers of fungal diversity and composition in the
   deciduous forest, while host effects were prominent in the evergreen
   forest. The belowground factors, i.e., soil pH, water content, and
   nutrients especially available P, were identified as the primary drivers
   of soil fungal communities in the broadleaved forests. Co-occurrence
   network analysis revealed assembly of fungal composition in broadleaved
   forest soils was non-random. The smaller modularity of the network in
   the deciduous forest reflects lower resistance to environment changes.
   Concluding, these results showed that plant community attributes, soil
   properties, and potential interactions among fungal functional guilds
   operate jointly on the divergence of soil fungal community assembly in
   the two broadleaved forest types.}},

Abstract = {{Suites of fungal adaptation to nutrient acquisition and allocation of
   vegetations are observed along forest succession gradients. However, the
   mechanisms behind seral shifts in plant-associated fungi need to be
   uncovered. To bridge this knowledge gap, the current study investigated
   the litter and soil chemical variables as well as the fungal community
   using high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing along a 30a-100a
   succession gradient of a subtropical forest ecosystem in Xishuangbanna,
   southwestern China. Litter nitrogen (N) content changed consistently
   with fungal alpha-diversity and the relative abundances of functional
   guilds, such as saprotrophs and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi.
   However, this trend was opposite to that observed for ectomycorrhizal
   (EcM) fungi and litter carbon (C) content. The total and water-soluble C
   and N contents as well as the C/N ratios in soil decreased with stand
   age, while the relative abundances of Rozellomycota, Chytridiomycota and
   lichens as well as the microbial C and N use efficiencies exhibited
   increasing trends across succession stages. Multivariate analysis and
   multiple linear regression showed that the seral shifts in fungal
   diversity and composition were closely related to the C:N stoichiometry
   of soil and litter. Specifically, the litter C content either negatively
   explained the alpha-diversity and saprotroph abundance or positively
   explained the abundance of EcM fungi. In contrast, the litter N content
   presented opposite trends. Further, the variances in the abundances of
   Rozellomycota and AM fungi were negatively explained by water-soluble C
   content but positively explained by water-soluble N content in the soil.
   These findings confirm that the replenishment and reduction of available
   nutrients are determined by plant-fungus interactions via the C:N
   stoichiometry of litter and soil along the forest chronosequence.}},

Abstract = {{The Philippines is known as one of the megadiverse countries in the
   world. One of its important biological resources are macrofungi which
   play an active role in wood decomposition, thereby contributing to
   nutrient recycling in the forest ecosystem. However, in spite of the
   important ecological role of macrofungi, little is known about their
   biodiversity in the Philippines. Investigations on the taxonomy and
   diversity of macrofungi are also gaining importance, as many macrofungi
   species are on the brink of extinction due to environmental destruction.
   Therefore, this study was conducted to document the different species of
   macrofungi in Ifugao Province, Philippines to come up with a species
   list of macrofungi in areas inhabited by the Ifugao indigenous
   community. Purposive sampling method was done to scan the nine barangay
   study sites: Bangaan, Poitan and Viewpoint in the municipality of
   Banaue, Bokiawan, Hapao and Poblacion in the municipality of Hungduan,
   and Chaya, Chumang and Mapawoy in the municipality of Mayoyao. Collected
   macrofungal samples were identified using both morphological and
   molecular methods. A total of 144 macrofungal samples were collected;
   out of these, 109 species were identified: 74 morphologically and 35
   molecularly. Of these samples, 71 macrofungi were identified up to the
   species level while 34 could only be identified up to the genus level.
   The identified macrofungi belonged to 30 families, 47 genera and 47
   species. Sixteen identified species of macrofungi were utilized as food
   as declared by the community and these are Agaricus sp., Auricularia
   auricula, Coprinellus disseminatus, Coprinus comatus, Lentinus
   sajorcaju, Lenzites elegans, Mycena sp., Oudemansiella canarii,
   Phellinus sp., Pleurotus djamor, Pleurotus ostreatus, Pleurotus sp.,

Abstract = {{Fine root decomposition constitutes a critical yet poorly understood

   Consistent positive effects of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations
   and negative effects of lignin concentration emerged on decomposition
   rates within sites. Similar relationships were present across sites,
   along with positive effects of temperature and moisture. Calcium was not
   consistently related to decomposition rate at either scale. While the

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In boreal ecosystems plant production is often limited by low
   availability of nitrogen. Nitrogen retention in below-ground organic
   pools plays an important role in restricting recirculation to plants and
   thereby hampers forest production. Saprotrophic fungi are commonly
   assigned to different decomposer strategies, but how these relate to
   nitrogen cycling remains to be understood. Decomposition of Scots pine
   needle litter was studied in axenic microcosms with the ligninolytic
   litter decomposing basidiomycete Gymnopus androsaceus or the stress
   tolerant ascomycete Chalara longipes. Changes in chemical composition
   were followed by C-13 CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy and nitrogen dynamics was
   assessed by the addition of a N-15 tracer. Decomposition by C. longipes
   resulted in nitrogen retention in non-hydrolysable organic matter,
   enriched in aromatic and alkylic compounds, whereas the ligninolytic G.
   androsaceus was able to access this pool, counteracting nitrogen
   retention. Our observations suggest that differences in decomposing
   strategies between fungal species play an important role in regulating
   nitrogen retention and release during litter decomposition, implying
   that fungal community composition may impact nitrogen cycling at the

Title = {{Changes in Fungal Communities across a Forest Disturbance Gradient}},
Journal = {{APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Deforestation has a substantial impact on aboveground biodiversity, but
   the response of belowground soil fungi remains poorly understood. In a
   tropical montane rainforest in southwestern China, plots were
   established along a forest degradation gradient ranging from mature and
   regenerated forests to open land to examine the impacts of forest
   degradation and deforestation on ecosystem diversity and function. Here,
   we evaluated the changes in belowground fungal diversity and community
   composition using a metabarcoding approach. Soil saprotrophic fungal
   richness declined with increasing forest disturbance. For example,
   Penicillium spp. (phosphorus {[}P]-solubilizing fungi) dominated in
   mature forest but were less abundant in regenerating forests and showed
   the lowest abundance in open land sites. Conversely, the abundance of
   facultative pathogenic fungi increased along the disturbance gradient.
   The decline in soil saprophytic fungi may be a direct result of forest
   disturbance or it may be associated with increased availability of soil
   phosphorus indirectly through an increase in soil pH. The increase in
   abundance of facultative pathogenic fungi may be related to reduced
   competition with saprotrophic fungi, changes in microclimate, or
   increased spore rain. These results demonstrate a loss of dominant
   P-solubilizing saprotrophic fungi along the disturbance gradient,
   indicating a change from soil P limitation in mature tropical forests to
   soil C limitation in deforested sites. The increased prevalence of
   pathogenic fungi may inhibit plant succession following deforestation.
   Overall, this research demonstrates that soil fungi can be used as a
   sensitive indicator for soil health to evaluate the consequences of
   forest disturbance.
   IMPORTANCE The soil fungal functional group changes in response to
   forest disturbance and indicates a close interaction between the
   aboveground plant community and the belowground soil biological
   community. Soil saprotrophic fungi declined in relative abundance with
   increasing forest disturbance. At the same time, the relative abundance
   of facultative pathogenic fungi increased. The loss of saprotrophic
   fungal richness and abundance may have been a direct result of forest
   disturbance or an indirect result of changes in soil pH and soil P.
   Furthermore, the dominant P-solubilizing saprotrophic fungi were
   replaced by diverse facultative pathogenic fungi, which have weaker C
   decomposition ability. These changes potentially indicate a shift from
   soil phosphate limitation to carbon limitation following deforestation.
   This study suggests that changes in fungal functional group composition
   can be used as an indicator of the effects of forest disturbance on soil
   carbon and nutrients.}},

   Hypholoma, Pholiota, Rhodocollybia and Calocera had delta N-15 values
   similar to ectomycorrhizal fungi, indicating overlap in use of older
   nitrogen from soil or roots or use of newly fixed nitrogen. Genera of
   litter and wood decay fungi varied up to 6 parts per thousand in delta
   C-13 and 10 parts per thousand in delta N-15, suggesting large
   differences in carbon and nitrogen sources and processing. Similar delta
   C-13 between white and brown rot wood decay fungi also suggest that
   white rot fungi do not use lignin-derived carbon. Together, these delta
   C-13 and delta N-15  patterns of fungi from Finnish boreal forests
   enhance our knowledge of fungal functional diversity and indicate broad
   use of litter, wood and soil resources. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Abstract = {{Spore characteristics of wood-inhabiting fungi suggest that wind is
   their predominant dispersal vector. However, since they are restricted
   to ephemeral habitats, colonizing new patches should benefit from
   dispersal by animals with similar habitat preferences because the
   directed, resource-searching movement of animals increases the
   likelihood of reaching suitable habitats. Here we determine which fungal
   guilds are carried by wood-inhabiting beetles and what influences
   beetle-associated fungal communities. High-throughput sequencing
   identified >1800 fungal taxa from beetle communities that emerged from
   64 experimental logs. Beetle-associated fungi included mutualistic,
   decomposing, pathogenic and mycorrhizal fungi; decomposers were the most
   diverse. Partial-procrustes analysis revealed that the total
   beetle-associated community and mutualists were correlated (p <= 0.05)
   with beetle community composition and decomposers were marginally
   correlated (p <= 0.10) with beetle community composition. All three
   groups were marginally correlated with the total fungal communities that
   inhabit the dead wood. Our results show that beetles carry a broad range
   of wood-inhabiting fungi and beetle-associated fungal communities are
   determined by environmental factors and the vectoring beetle community
   and to some degree by the fungal source community. This suggests that
   wood-inhabiting beetles contribute to fungal dispersal, including
   directed dispersal, which could affect fungal community assembly and
   ecosystem processes like wood decomposition. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Aim Leaf nutrient resorption is a key nutrient conservation trait, which
   also influences nutrient cycling rates and pools. Most global
   biogeochemical models assume that resorption is non-varying at a
   temporal scale. However, this trait can differ substantially within
   populations among years. We assessed the commonality of attaining
   proficient resorption, the factors associated with proficient
   resorption, as well as the variability of this trait and the factors
   controlling trait variability. Location Global. Time period 1965-2009.
   Major taxa studied Plants. Methods We compiled multi-year nutrient
   resorption data from the literature, representing 50 studies, 94 unique
   study locations, and 141 species from 53 families and 29 orders. We used
   multiple linear regression to relate resorption data, as well as the
   variability in this trait, expressed as the coefficient of variation, to
   environmental factors. Results Resource availability was a key driver of
   resorption, with nutrient-poor soils associated with more complete
   resorption and lower resorption plasticity. Nitrogen and phosphorus
   resorption differentially responded to some drivers, such as leaf habit,
   soil order and mycorrhizal status. Main conclusions Overall,
   environmental and biological factors representing a strong selective
   force for nutrient conservation, such as nutrient-poor soil orders,
   semi-arid soil moisture regimes, or lack of plant mutualists, were
   associated with complete resorption, whereas incomplete resorption was
   associated with weak selective forces, such as nutrient-rich soil
   orders, or factors impeding this physiological process (e.g., drought).
   Inter-annual variability in resorption was common, particularly for
   phosphorus. This plasticity has implications for ecosystem nutrient
   cycling and plant productivity, and accounting for this plasticity in
   dynamic models of nutrient cycling will improve predictions of nutrient
   limitations and productivity under future climate conditions.}},

   Soil Microsites Differing in Phosphatase Activity}},
Journal = {{PEDOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{To understand nutrient cycling in soils, soil processes and
   microorganisms need be better characterized. To determine whether
   specific trophic groups of fungi are associated with soil enzyme
   activity, we used soil imprinting to guide mm-scale sampling from
   microsites with high and low phosphatase activities in birch/Douglas-fir
   stands. Study 1 involved sampling one root window per site at 12 sites
   of different ages (stands); study 2 was conducted at one of the
   stem-exclusion stands, at which 5 root windows had been installed. Total
   fungal and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal terminal-restriction fragment
   length polymorphism (TRFLP) fingerprints differed between high- and
   low-phosphatase activity microsites at 8 of 12 root windows across 12
   sites. Where differences were detected, fewer EM fungi were detected in
   high- than low-phosphatase activity microsites. Using 5 root windows at
   one site, next-generation sequencing detected similar fungal communities
   across microsites, but the ratio of saprotrophic to EM fungal reads was
   higher in high-phosphatase activity microsites in the two windows that
   had low EM fungal richness. In windows with differences in fungal
   communities, both studies indicated that EM fungi were less successful
   than saprotrophic fungi in colonizing fine-scale, organic matter-rich
   microsites. Fine-scale sampling linked with in situ detection of enzyme
   activity revealed relationships between soil fungal communities and
   phosphatase activity that could not be observed at the scales employed
   by conventional approaches, thereby contributing to the understanding of
   fine-scale phosphorus cycling in forest soils.}},

Title = {{Climatic controls of decomposition drive the global biogeography of

Abstract = {{The identity of the dominant root-associated microbial symbionts in a
   forest determines the ability of trees to access limiting nutrients from
   atmospheric or soil pools(1,2), sequester carbon(3,4) and withstand the
   effects of climate change(5,6). Characterizing the global distribution
   of these symbioses and identifying the factors that control this
   distribution are thus integral to understanding the present and future
   functioning of forest ecosystems. Here we generate a spatially explicit
   global map of the symbiotic status of forests, using a database of over
   1.1 million forest inventory plots that collectively contain over 28,000
   tree species. Our analyses indicate that climate variables-in
   particular, climatically controlled variation in the rate of
   decomposition-are the primary drivers of the global distribution of
   major symbioses. We estimate that ectomycorrhizal trees, which represent
   only 2\% of all plant species(7), constitute approximately 60\% of tree
   stems on Earth. Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis dominates forests in which
   seasonally cold and dry climates inhibit decomposition, and is the
   predominant form of symbiosis at high latitudes and elevation. By
   contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees dominate in aseasonal, warm
   tropical forests, and occur with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate
   biomes in which seasonally warm-and-wet climates enhance decomposition.
   Continental transitions between forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal or
   arbuscular mycorrhizal trees occur relatively abruptly along
   climate-driven decomposition gradients; these transitions are probably
   caused by positive feedback effects between plants and microorganisms.
   Symbiotic nitrogen fixers-which are insensitive to climatic controls on
   decomposition (compared with mycorrhizal fungi)-are most abundant in
   arid biomes with alkaline soils and high maximum temperatures. The
   climatically driven global symbiosis gradient that we document provides
   a spatially explicit quantitative understanding of microbial symbioses
   at the global scale, and demonstrates the critical role of microbial
   mutualisms in shaping the distribution of plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Declining biodiversity (BD) is affecting food security, agricultural
   sustainability, and environmental quality. Agroforestry (AF) is
   recognized as a possible partial solution for BD conservation and
   improvement. This manuscript uses published peer-reviewed manuscripts,
   reviews, meta-analysis, and federal and state agency documents to
   evaluate relationships between AF and BD and how AF can be used to
   conserve BD. The review revealed that floral, faunal, and soil microbial
   diversity were significantly greater in AF as compared to monocropping,
   adjacent crop lands, and within crop alleys and some forests. Among the
   soil organisms, arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi (AMF), bacteria, and enzyme
   activities were significantly greater in AF than crop and livestock
   practices. Agroforestry also creates spatially concentrated high-density
   BD near trees due to favorable soil-plant-water-microclimate conditions.
   The greater BD was attributed to heterogeneous vegetation, organic
   carbon, microclimate, soil conditions, and spatial distribution of
   trees. Differences in BD between AF and other management types
   diminished with time. Evenly distributed leaves, litter, roots,
   dead/live biological material, and microclimate improve soil and
   microclimate in adjacent crop and pasture areas as the system matures.
   Results of the study prove that integration of AF can improve BD in
   agricultural lands. Selection of site suitable tree/shrub/grass-crop
   combinations can be used to help address soil nutrient deficiencies or
   environmental conditions. Future studies with standardized management
   protocols may be needed for all regions to further strengthen these
   findings and to develop AF establishment criteria for BD conservation
   and agricultural sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the responses of heterotrophic (R-h) and autotrophic (R-a)
   components of soil respiration (R-s) to warming is important in
   evaluating and modelling the effects of changes in climate on soil
   carbon (C) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. We used a mesocosm system
   with buried heating cables (5 degrees C warming) to investigate the
   responses of R-s, R-h and R-a to warming in a subtropical forest in
   southern China. Soil CO2 effluxes were measured with a portable
   automatic soil CO2 flux system from March 2014 to July 2015. We found
   that warming increased mean R-s and R-h from 788 to 1036 g C m(-2)
   year(-1) (+31\%) and from 512 to 707 g C m(-2) year(-1) (+38\%),
   respectively. There was no difference in R-a between the warming
   treatment and the control. The lack of response of R-a to warming was
   probably because the fine root biomass did not change with warming
   treatment. Soil warming also increased available dissolved organic
   carbon, microbial biomass carbon, actinomycetal biomass and arbuscular
   mycorrhizal biomass. Our results suggest that R-h might be more
   sensitive to climate warming than R-a, and future climate warming could
   increase soil C loss from increased R-h in subtropical forest
   ecosystems. Highlights

Title = {{Influence of Ammonium on Formation of Mineral-Associated Organic Carbon
   by an Ectomycorrhizal Fungus}},
Journal = {{APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and mineral
   particles are critical for the stabilization of soil organic matter
   (SOM) in terrestrial ecosystems. The processing of DOM by
   ectomycorrhizal fungi contributes to the formation of mineral-stabilized
   SOM by two contrasting pathways: the extracellular transformation of DOM
   (ex vivo pathway) and the secretion of mineral-surface-reactive
   metabolites (in vivo pathway). In this study, we examined how changes in
   nitrogen (N) availability affected the formation of mineral-associated
   carbon (C) from these two pathways. DOM was extracted from forest soils.
   The processing of this DOM by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus
   involutus was examined in laboratory-scale studies with different levels
   of ammonium. At low levels of ammonium (i.e., under N-limited
   conditions), the DOM components were slightly oxidized, and fungal C
   metabolites with iron-reducing activity were secreted. Ammonium
   amendments decreased the amount of C metabolites, and no additional
   oxidation of the organic matter was detected. In contrast, the
   hydrolytic activity and the secretion of N-containing compounds
   increased, particularly when high levels of ammonium were added. Under
   these conditions, C, but not N, limited fungal growth. Although the
   overall production of mineral-associated organic C was not affected by
   ammonium concentrations, the observed shifts in the activities of the ex
   vivo and in vivo pathways affected the composition of organic matter
   adsorbed onto the mineral particles. Such changes will affect the
   properties of organic matter-mineral associations and, thus, ultimately,
   the stabilization of SOM.
   IMPORTANCE Nitrogen (N) availability plays a critical role in the
   cycling and storage of soil organic matter (SOM). However, large
   uncertainties remain in predicting the net effect of N addition on soil
   organic carbon (C) storage due to the complex interactions between
   organic matter, microbial activity, and mineral particles that determine
   the formation of stable SOM. Here, we attempted to disentangle the
   effects of ammonium on these interactions in controlled microcosm
   experiments including the ectomycorrhizal fungus P.involutus and
   dissolved organic matter extracted from forest soils. Increased ammonium
   levels affected the fungal processing of the organic material as well as
   the secretion of extracellular metabolites. Although ammonium additions
   did not increase the net production of mineral-adsorbed C, changes in
   the decomposition and secretion pathways altered the composition of the
   adsorbed organic matter. These changes may influence the properties of
   the organic mattermineral associations and, thus, the stabilization of
   SOM.}},

Abstract = {{Rates of leaf litter decay are generally expected to accelerate with

   changes in the quality of litter residues or in the composition of
   decompose communities that result in unexpected decay responses. We
   performed a 23-month litter decomposition study al a long-term soil
   warming experiment to determine how soil warming affects litter decay
   rate, litter chemistry extracellular enzyme activities, and fungal
   community composition. Experimental soil warming did not affect litter
   mass loss, but did result in a 23\% increase in the relative abundance
   of lignin; a concomitant shift in enzyme activity wherein
   lignin-decomposing enzymes had higher activity in the heated treatment
   while cellu. lose-decomposing enzymes were suppressed; and a shift in
   the composition of the active fungal community. In particular,
   ectomycorrhizal fungi were three times more abundant in the heated
   treatment than the control, and shifts in fungal community composition
   were significantly correlated with the observed changes in extracellular
   enzyme activities. Our results suggest that warming altered the
   trajectory of decay resulting in litter residue: enriched in lignin

Abstract = {{Information on pathways and rates of decomposition of coarse woody
   debris (CWD) from one of the dominant boreal tree species-Siberian larch
   (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) - is scarce. We examined presence and
   distribution of internal decay in its living trees and decomposition
   rates in an 88-year chronosequence of logs in an old-growth mesic mixed
   European boreal forest. Fifty-two percent of the trees started decaying
   prior to death. Butt or stem rot was caused by white- and brown-rot
   biotrophic fungi in almost equal proportions. Those trees lost on
   average 29\% of their initial wood mass. The mean decomposition rate of
   wood as related to initial conditions was 0.007 yr(-1) for wood with
   initial biotrophic decay and 0.010 yr(-1) for wood with saprotrophic
   decay. Bark lost its mass and volume faster-at a rate of 0.056 yr(-1).
   The rate of carbon (C) loss for the whole stem was 0.024 yr(-1) in wood
   affected by saprotrophic fungi and 0.007 yr(-1) when the tree was
   affected by biotrophic fungi. When calculating C losses due to
   decomposition, separating bark and wood with different C concentrations
   and decomposition patterns as well as the rate of biotrophic and
   saprotrophic decay enables us to refine estimates of the role of
   Siberian larch CWD in C cycling. Further research is still needed to
   resolve uncertainties around the role of fungal communities and the
   origins and decomposition rates of butt rots and stem rots in living
   trees of Siberian larch, as well as the distribution patterns of these
   fungi and decomposition processes in individual trees and at the

Abstract = {{It is now widely accepted that the majority of tropical landscapes are
   in transition from disturbance to recovery. Remediation efforts are
   occurring in Central and South America, attempting to recuperate the
   soils, often using indigenous nitrogen (N)-fixing tree species. Tree
   species-generated soil microbial heterogeneity might be important in
   facilitating regeneration of forest vegetation growth and, although some
   work has identified these efforts may enhance the soil carbon (C), there
   have been few studies conducted on how these trees are affecting the
   below-ground soil biological dynamics in these regions. Here, we
   explored how and to what extent individual plant effects of a native
   N-fixing and non-N-fixing plant has affected the below-ground soil C and
   N metrics and soil bacterial and fungal community composition. To begin
   to address this, we examined if there were differences in various soil
   abiotic factors (ToC, TN, C:N ratio, C-mic , NH4+, NO3-, pH, and \%
   moisture) and in the soil bacterial and fungal community composition
   associated with soil of a native non-N-fixer, Dipteryx panamensis and a
   native N-fixer, Pentaclethra macroloba, and in comparison to the primary
   forest bulk-soil in which these tree species occur. We found that
   primary forest-soils had the greatest amounts of soil NH4+ and C-mic,
   followed by Pentaclethra-soils. Dipteryx-soils had the least amount of
   soil C-mic and NH4+, but the greatest amounts of soil NO3-. The
   PERMANOVA results indicated that the Bray-Curtis soil bacterial and
   fungal community compositions were significantly different between
   N-fixing and non-N-fixing tree-soils, and also to that of the primary
   forest-soils. Our results also demonstrated that soil NH4+ best
   explained the variation observed in the soil C-mic patterns (39.2\%),
   and, both the soil bacterial (22.8\%) and fungal community composition
   (18.1\%). Furthermore, we provide evidence that the N-fixer
   Pentaclethra-soils stimulates the production of more soil C-mic than the
   non-N-fixer Dipteryx-soils. It is clear that these tree species are
   important in creating changes in the soil microbial community
   composition, and that NH4+ may be associated with a shift in a
   functional response that may have implications for CUE and remediation
   in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Recent initiatives, such as the United Nations declaring 2015 as the
   International Year of Soils and the French ``4 per 1000{''} initiative
   call attention on soils and on the importance of maintaining and
   increasing soil organic matter stocks for soil fertility and food
   security, and for climate change adaptation and mitigation. We stress
   that soil organic carbon storage (i.e. an increase of soil organic
   carbon stocks) should be clearly differentiated from soil organic carbon
   sequestration, as the latter assumes a net removal of atmospheric CO2.
   Implementing management options that allow increasing soil organic
   carbon stocks at the local scale raises several questions, which are
   discussed in this article: how can we increase SOC stocks, at which rate
   and for how long; where do we prioritize SOC storage; how do we estimate
   the potential gain in C and which agricultural practices should we
   implement? We show that knowledge and tools are available to answer many
   of these questions, while further research remains necessary for others.
   A range of agricultural practices would require a re-assessment of their
   potential to store C and a better understanding of the underlying
   processes, such as no tillage and conservation agriculture, irrigation,
   practices increasing below ground inputs, organic amendments, and N
   fertilization. The vision emerging from the literature, showing the
   prominent role of soil microorganisms in the stabilization of soil
   organic matter, draw the attention to more exploratory potential levers,
   through changes in microbial physiology or soil biodiversity induced by
   agricultural practices, that require in-depth research.}},

Abstract = {{Rising winter air temperature will reduce snow depth and duration over
   the next century in northern hardwood forests. Reductions in snow depth
   may affect soil bacteria and fungi directly, but also affect soil
   microbes indirectly through effects of snowpack loss on plant roots. We
   incubated root exclusion and root ingrowth cores across a winter
   climate-elevation gradient in a northern hardwood forest for 29 months
   to identify direct (i.e., winter snow-mediated) and indirect (i.e.,
   root-mediated) effects of winter snowpack decline on soil bacterial and
   fungal communities, as well as on potential nitrification and net N
   mineralization rates. Both winter snowpack decline and root exclusion
   increased bacterial richness and phylogenetic diversity. Variation in
   bacterial community composition was best explained by differences in
   winter snow depth or soil frost across elevation. Root ingrowth had a
   positive effect on the relative abundance of several bacterial taxonomic
   orders (e.g., Acidobacterales and Actinomycetales). Nominally
   saprotrophic (e.g., Saccharomycetales and Mucorales) or mycorrhizal
   (e.g., Helotiales, Russalales, Thelephorales) fungal taxonomic orders
   were also affected by both root ingrowth and snow depth variation.
   However, when grouped together, the relative abundance of saprotrophic
   fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and ectomycorrhizal fungi were not
   affected by root ingrowth or snow depth, suggesting that traits in
   addition to trophic mode will mediate fungal community responses to
   snowpack decline in northern hardwood forests. Potential soil
   nitrification rates were positively related to ammonia-oxidizing
   bacteria and archaea abundance (e.g., Nitrospirales, Nitrosomondales,
   Nitrosphaerales). Rates of N mineralization were positively and
   negatively correlated with ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi,
   respectively, and these relationships were mediated by root exclusion.
   The results from this study suggest that a declining winter snowpack and
   its effect on plant roots each have direct effects on the diversity and
   abundance of soil bacteria and fungal communities that interact to
   determine rates of soil N cycling in northern hardwood forests.}},

   years later, the different methods of management resulted in
   unexpectedly distinctive habitat heterogeneity with a high variation in

   into soil resulted in lower abundance of fungi but greater fungal
   diversity (which may enhance ecosystem stability) and was beneficial for
   the growth of Scots pines. Removal of post-harvest woody debris from the

   in the soil of the subsequent 10-year-old Scots pine plantation having:

Abstract = {{Plants produce above- and below-ground biomass. However, our
   understanding of both production and decomposition of below-ground
   biomass is poor, largely because of the difficulties of accessing roots.
   Below-ground organic matter decomposition studies are scant and
   especially rare in the tropics. In this study, we used a litter bag
   experiment to quantify the mass loss and nutrient dynamics of
   decomposing twigs and small roots from an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal
   associated tree, Parashorea chinensis Wang Hsie, in a tropical rain
   forest in Southwest China. Overall, twig litter decomposed 1.9 times
   faster than small roots (decay rate (k) twig = 0.255, root = 0.134). The
   difference in decomposition rates can be explained by a difference in
   phosphorus (P) concentration, availability, and use by decomposers or
   carbon quality. Twigs and small roots showed an increase in nitrogen
   concentration, with final concentrations still higher than initial
   levels. This suggests nitrogen transfer from the surrounding environment
   into decomposing twigs and small roots. Both carbon and nitrogen
   dynamics were significantly predicted by mass loss and showed a negative
   and positive relationship, respectively. Our study results imply that
   small roots carbon and nitrogen increase the resident time in the soil.
   Therefore, a better understanding of the carbon cycle requires a better
   understanding of the mechanisms governing below-ground biomass
   decomposition.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Forest Thinning on Soil Microbial Community Structure and

Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Microbial communities and their associated enzyme activities play key
   roles in carbon cycling in ecosystems. Forest thinning is likely to
   change the soil properties and feedbacks on the structure and function
   of microbial communities, consequently affecting microbial regulation on
   the soil carbon process. However, few studies have focused on the
   mechanism of how thinning affects the quantity and stability of soil
   carbon. To reveal the influence of thinning on soil carbon and to
   explore the regulated key factors, this study was conducted in a pure
   Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr plantation with different thinning
   intensity (light, medium, and high) in Shanxi province, China. Soil
   properties (soil pH, soil water content, soil organic carbon, and soil
   microbial biomass carbon) were measured. Meanwhile, soil microbial
   communities were examined with the method of phospholipid fatty acid
   (PLFA), and soil enzyme activities were measured as indicators of soil
   microbial functions. The results showed that medium and high thinning
   has positive effects on soil organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon,
   soil microbial abundance, and soil enzyme activities. Actinomycetes and
   gram-negative bacteria were the major factors to affect soil microbial
   community function relating to carbon decomposition. Soil pH contributed
   to actinomycetes and gram-negative bacteria through direct influences on
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Moreover, there were strong correlations
   between soil pH and microbial community to control soil carbon turnover.
   The increasing of soil microbial abundance and the microbial regulation
   on soil carbon in forest thinning need to be considered for sustainable
   forest management practices in northern China.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate projections of the terrestrial carbon (C) sink are critical to
   understanding the future global C cycle and setting CO2 emission
   reduction goals. Current earth system models (ESMs) and dynamic global
   vegetation models (DGVMs) with coupled carbon-nitrogen cycles project
   that future terrestrial C sequestration will be limited by nitrogen (N)
   availability, but the magnitude of N limitation remains a critical
   uncertainty. Plants use multiple symbiotic nutrient acquisition
   strategies to mitigate N limitation, but current DGVMs omit these
   mechanisms. Fully coupling N-acquiring plant-microbe symbioses to soil
   organic matter (SOM) cycling within a DGVM for the first time, we show
   that increases in N acquisition via SOM decomposition and atmospheric
   N-2 fixation could support long-term enhancement of terrestrial C
   sequestration at global scales under elevated CO2. The model reproduced
   elevated CO2 responses from two experiments (Duke and Oak Ridge)
   representing contrasting N acquisition strategies. N release from
   enhanced SOM decomposition supported vegetation growth at Duke, while
   inorganic N depletion limited growth at Oak Ridge. Global simulations
   reproduced spatial patterns of N-acquiring symbioses from a novel
   niche-based map of mycorrhizal fungi. Under a 100-ppm increase in CO2
   concentrations, shifts in N acquisition pathways facilitated 200 Pg C of
   terrestrial C sequestration over 100years compared to 50 Pg C for a
   scenario with static N acquisition pathways. Our results suggest that N
   acquisition strategies are important determinants of terrestrial C
   sequestration potential under elevated CO2 and that nitrogen-enabled
   DGVMs that omit symbiotic N acquisition may underestimate future
   terrestrial C uptake.
   Plain Language Summary
   Plants grow faster when there is more carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air.
   Because plant growth removes CO2 from the air, this faster plant growth
   could lessen the warming that is caused by CO2 emissions from human
   activities. However, plants also need nitrogen to grow, and the
   availability of this nutrient could constrain, or limit, how much CO2
   plants can remove from the air. Correctly predicting the degree of
   nitrogen limitation of plant growth is a major challenge for global land
   models. Some plants can overcome nitrogen limitation by partnering with
   fungi that extract nitrogen from the soil or with bacteria that extract
   nitrogen from the air. We incorporated these plant-microbe partnerships
   into a global land model, and we show that these partnerships could
   sustain plant growth under rising CO2 concentrations. This suggests that
   existing models and experiments that do not include these partnerships
   may underestimate the potential for future CO2 uptake by plants.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical forests play a dominant role in the global carbon (C) cycle,
   and models predict increases in tropical net primary productivity (NPP)
   and C storage in response to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)
   concentrations. The extent to which increasing CO2 will enhance NPP
   depends in part on the availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)
   to support growth. Some tropical trees can potentially overcome nutrient
   limitation by acquiring N via symbiotic dinitrogen (N-2) fixation, which
   may provide a benefit in acquiring P via investment in N-rich
   phosphatase enzymes or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We conducted a
   seedling experiment to investigate the effects of elevated CO2 and soil
   nutrient availability on the growth of two N-2-fixing and two
   non-N-2-fixing tropical tree species. We hypothesized that under
   elevated CO2 and at low nutrient availability (i.e., low N and P), N-2
   fixers would have higher growth rates than non-N-2 fixers because N-2
   fixers have a greater capacity to acquire both N and P. We also
   hypothesized that differences in growth rates between N-2 fixers and
   non-N-2 fixers would decline as nutrient availability increases because
   N-2 fixers no longer have an advantage in nutrient acquisition. We found
   that the N-2 fixers had higher growth rates than the non-N-2 fixers
   under elevated CO2 and at low nutrient availability, and that the
   difference in growth rates between the N-2 and non-N-2 fixers declined
   as nutrient availability increased, irrespective of CO2. Overall, N-2
   fixation, root phosphatase activity, and AM colonization decreased with
   increasing nutrient availability, and increased under elevated CO2 at
   low nutrient availability. Further, AM colonization was positively
   related to the growth of the non-N-2 fixers, whereas both N-2 fixation
   and root phosphatase activity were positively related to the growth of
   the N-2 fixers. Though our results indicate all four tree species have
   the capacity to up- or down-regulate nutrient acquisition to meet their
   stoichiometric demands, the greater capacity for the N-2 fixers to
   acquire both N and P may enable them to overcome nutritional constraints
   to NPP under elevated CO2, with implications for the response of
   tropical forests to future environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Many trees form ectomycorrhizal symbiosis with fungi. During symbiosis,
   the tree roots supply sugar to the fungi in exchange for nitrogen, and
   this process is critical for the nitrogen and carbon cycles in forest
   ecosystems. However, the extents to which ectomycorrhizal fungi can
   liberate nitrogen and modify the soil organic matter and the mechanisms
   by which they do so remain unclear since they have lost many enzymes for
   litter decomposition that were present in their freeliving, saprotrophic
   ancestors. Using time-series spectroscopy and transcriptomics, we
   examined the ability of two ectomycorrhizal fungi from two independently
   evolved ectomycorrhizal lineages to mobilize soil organic nitrogen. Both
   species oxidized the organic matter and accessed the organic nitrogen.
   The expression of those events was controlled by the availability of
   glucose and inorganic nitrogen. Despite those similarities, the
   decomposition mechanisms, including the type of genes involved as well
   as the patterns of their expression, differed markedly between the two
   species. Our results suggest that in agreement with their diverse
   evolutionary origins, ectomycorrhizal fungi use different decomposition
   mechanisms to access organic nitrogen entrapped in soil organic matter.
   The timing and magnitude of the expression of the decomposition activity

   investigated relationships among decay rates, mycorrhizal association,

Abstract = {{Litter decomposition is a prominent pathway for nutrient availability

   cropland, shrubland, grassland, and forest, selected randomly from a
   300-700 m elevation were investigated for the experiment using the
   litter bag technique. Litter mass loss ranged from 26.9\% (forest) to
   44.3\% (cropland) varying significantly among land use types. The
   initial litter quality, mainly N and C/N, had a significant effect on
   the litter loss rate. The interaction of elevation x land use types x
   time was significant (p < 0.001). Litter nutrient mobility (K > P
   approximate to N > C) of the decomposing litter was sporadic with
   substantial stoichiometric effects of C/N, N/P, and C/P. The residual
   litters were enriched in N-15 and depleted in C-13 as compared to the
   initial litter. Increment of N, P, and delta N-15 values in residual

Abstract = {{Wildfires burn approximately 1\% of boreal forest yearly, being one of
   the most significant factors affecting soil organic matter (SOM) pools.
   Boreal forests are largely situated in the permafrost zone, which
   contains half of global soil carbon (C). Wildfires advance thawing of
   permafrost by burning the insulating organic layer and decreasing
   surface albedo, thus increasing soil temperatures. Fires also affect SOM
   quality through chemical and physical changes, such as the formation of
   resistant C compounds. The long-term post-fire effects on SOM quality,
   degradability and isotopic composition are not well known in permafrost
   forests. We studied the effect of forest fires on the proportional sizes
   of SOM pools with chemical fractionation (extracting with water, ethanol
   and acid) of soil samples (5, 30 and 50cm depths) collected from a fire
   chronosequence in the upland mineral soils of the Canadian permafrost
   zone. We also determined the C-13 and N-15 isotopic composition of soil
   after fire. In the topsoil horizon (5cm) recent fire areas contained a
   smaller fraction of labile SOM and were slightly more enriched with N-15
   and C-13 than older fire areas. The SOM fraction ratios reverted towards
   pre-fire status with succession. Changes in SOM were less apparent
   deeper in the soil. Best predictors for the size of recalcitrant SOM
   fraction were active layer depth, vegetation biomass and soil C/N ratio,

Abstract = {{AimsNitrogen (N) addition could affect litter decomposition through its
   direct effects on soil N availability and indirect effects on initial

   of fine roots with different diameter classes.MethodsA two-year
   reciprocal replant-transplant field experiment was conducted in a
   Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) plantation to examine
   the relative effect of exogenous and endogenous N enrichment induced by
   N addition (10gNm(-2)yr.(-1)) on the decomposition of fine roots with
   different diameter classes: < 0.5mm (small fine root, SFR) and 0.5-2mm
   (large fine root, LFR).ResultsThe LFR had significantly higher
   decomposition rates (k: 0.315-0.397yr.(-1)) than the SFR
   (0.245-0.274yr.(-1)) after 2years of incubation. Exogenous N (i.e.,
   increased soil N availability due to N addition) had no significant
   effect on the decomposition rates of fine roots, whereas endogenous N
   (i.e. increased N concentration in litter due to N addition) inhibited
   and accelerated the decomposition of SFR and LFR, respectively.
   Endogenous N decreased the net release of N but both endogenous and
   exogenous N increased the net release of phosphorus (P) from SFR. By
   contrast, exogenous and endogenous N decreased the net release of N and
   P from LFR.ConclusionsOur results suggest that N addition affected fine
   root decomposition indirectly by changing the chemical traits of fine
   roots rather than directly through changing soil N availability.
   Elevated input and decreased net N release of fine roots might be a
   potential mechanism explaining the increases of total organic carbon and
   total N in the semi-arid forest soil under N addition. Our study also
   suggests that SFR may be a more important source of stable soil organic

Abstract = {{Premise of research.Plant functional groups of different stages of

   length and incidence, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)
   colonization. Rhizospheric and bulk soils were sampled to assess
   microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN);
   basal respiration; total and labile C; and concentrations of N, P, K,
   Ca, and Mg.Pivotal results.Fine roots with longer SRL, greater incidence
   of root hairs, longer root hairs, and greater AMF colonization were
   exhibited by plants in early-successional stages in contrast with plants
   in late-successional ones. Nutrient depletion zones were detected in the
   rhizospheres of plants in early-successional stages. Fine roots from the
   late-successional sites exhibited greater diameter and tissue density.
   High values for labile C, MBC, MBN, basal respiration, and the nutrient
   accumulation zone occurred in the rhizospheres of plants in
   late-successional stages in contrast with the rhizospheres of plants in
   early-successional ones.Conclusions.Our results suggest that
   early-successional plant species invest in fine roots with morphological
   features for a highly efficient nutrient uptake and in AMF (scavenging
   strategy), whereas late-successional plant species invest in other
   chemoheterotrophic microorganisms in the rhizosphere (mining strategy)
   for nutrient acquisition.}},

Abstract = {{The extent of young postfire conifer forests is growing throughout
   western North America as the frequency and size of high-severity fires
   increase, making it important to understand ecosystem structure and
   function in early seral forests. Understanding nitrogen (N) dynamics
   during postfire stand development is especially important because
   northern conifers are often N limited. We resampled lodgepole pine
   (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) stands that regenerated naturally after
   the 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA) to ask (1)
   How have N pools and fluxes changed over a decade (15 to 25 yr postfire)
   of very rapid forest growth? (2) At postfire year 25, how do N pools and
   fluxes vary with lodgepole pine density and productivity? Lodgepole pine
   foliage, litter (annual litterfall, forest-floor litter), and mineral
   soils were sampled in 14 plots (0.25 ha) that varied in postfire
   lodgepole pine density (1,500 to 344,000 stems/ha) and aboveground net
   primary production (ANPP; 1.4 to 16.1 Mg center dot ha(-1)center dot
   yr(-1)). Counter to expectation, foliar N concentrations in lodgepole
   pine current-year and composite needles (1.33 and 1.11\% N,
   respectively) had not changed over time. Further, all measured ecosystem
   N pools increased substantially: foliar N increased to 89 kg N/ha
   (+93\%), O-horizon N increased to 39 kg N/ha (+38\%), and mineral soil
   percent total N (0-15 cm) increased to 0.08\% (+33\%). Inorganic N
   availability also increased to 0.69 mu g N center dot{[}g
   resin](-1)center dot d(-1) (+165\%). Thus, soil N did not decline as
   live biomass N pools increased. Among stands, biomass N pools at
   postfire year 25 remained strongly influenced by early postfire tree
   density: foliar and litterfall N concentrations declined with lodgepole
   pine density and ANPP, but the foliar N pool increased. Lodgepole pine
   ANPP correlated negatively with annual resin-sorbed N, and we found no
   indication of widespread N limitation. The large increases in N pools
   cannot be explained by atmospheric N deposition or presence of known N
   fixers. These results suggest an unmeasured N source and are consistent
   with recent reports of N fixation in young lodgepole pine.}},

   communities, bacterial communities, and soil enzymatic repertoires may
   be variably impacted by different site preparation schemes after
   disturbance. We compared effects of three rehabilitation schemes on
   fungal community composition, bacterial community composition, and
   potential hydrolase activities (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, acid
   phosphatase, and cellobiohydrolase) at two times (14 days and 5 months

   shifted to saprotroph dominance (i.e. increased Mortierella, and

   previously associated with mycelial necromass colonization were higher

Abstract = {{In forest ecosystems, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are important for
   plant growth and soil biogeochemical processes. The biochemical
   composition of ECM mycelium is an important fungal effect trait with
   consequences for its decomposition rate, and consequently on soil carbon
   pools and plant nutrition. Although the link between ECM fungi and leaf
   litter-released nutrients is well known, the response of ECM fungal
   biochemical composition to different leaf litter species remains poorly
   understood. To determine how leaf litter quality influences ECM fungi's
   biochemical profiles, we planted young beech trees in an oak forest and
   replaced the natural leaf litter with that of European beech (Fagus
   sylvatica), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), or
   lime (Tilia cordata). We assessed the biochemical profiles of ECM root
   tips colonized by common fungal taxa in temperate forests (i.e.,
   Cenococcum geophilum, Inocybe sp., and Lactarius subdulcis), using
   attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (ATR-FTIR). ECM fungal biochemical composition changed with leaf litter
   species. Changes were apparent in the infrared absorption bands assigned
   to functional groups of lipids, amides, and carbohydrates. C. geophilum
   and L. subdulcis exhibited large spectral differences corresponding to
   the initial pattern of leaf litter chemical composition between samples
   collected in the beech and ash leaf litter treatments. In contrast,
   Inocybe sp. was influenced by lime, but with no differences between
   samples from ash or beech leaf litter treatments. Although the spectral
   bands affected by leaf litter type differed among ECM fungi, they were
   mainly related to amides, indicating a dynamic response of the fungal
   proteome to soil nutritional changes. Overall, the results indicate that
   the biochemical response of ECM fungi to leaf litter species varies
   among ECM fungal species and suggests that the biochemical composition
   of ECM mycelium is a fungal response trait, sensitive to environmental
   changes such as shifts in leaf litter species.}},

Abstract = {{Humans have dramatically increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition
   globally. At the coarsest resolution, N deposition is correlated with
   shifts from ectomycorrhizal (EcM) to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree
   dominance. At finer resolution, ectomycorrhizal fungal (EcMF) and
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities respond strongly to
   long-term N deposition with the disappearance of key taxa.
   Conifer-associated EcMF are more sensitive than other EcMF, with current
   estimates of critical loads at 5-6 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for the former and
   10-20 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for the latter. Where loads are exceeded, strong
   plant-soil and microbe-soil feedbacks may slow recovery rates after
   abatement of N deposition. Critical loads for AMF and tropical EcMF
   require additional study. In general, the responses of EcMF to N
   deposition are better understood than those of AMF because of
   methodological tractability. Functional consequences of EcMF community
   change are linked to decreases by fungi with medium-distance exploration
   strategies, hydrophobic walls, proteolytic capacity, and perhaps
   peroxidases for acquiring N from soil organic matter. These functional
   losses may contribute to declines in forest floor decomposition under N
   deposition. For AMF, limited capacity to directly access complexed
   organic N may reduce functional consequences, but research is needed to
   test this hypothesis. Mycorrhizal biomass often declines with N
   deposition, but the relative contributions of alternate mechanisms for
   this decline (lower C supply, higher C cost, physiological stress by N)
   have not been quantified. Furthermore, fungal biomass and functional
   responses to N inputs probably depend on ecosystem P status, yet how N
   deposition-induced P limitation interacts with belowground C flux and
   mycorrhizal community structure and function is still unclear. Current
   `omic analyses indicate potential functional differences among fungal
   lineages and should be integrated with studies of physiology, host
   nutrition, growth and health, fungal and plant community structure, and

Abstract = {{The contribution of the mycorrhizospheric microbes in a stand of
   ectomycorrhizal Norway spruce (Picea abies) featuring mycorrhiza with

   fungus with respect to pathogen attack could be validated against
   Botrytis cinerea and Heterobasidion annosum in co-cultures revealing
   reduced pathogen growth, higher survival rate of the spruce trees and
   reduced symptoms on needles upon symbiosis with T. vaccinum. The
   community structure was shown to yield a high diversity in ECM forming
   basidiomycetes of Thelephorales and Agaricales associated with a rich
   bacterial diversity dominated by Rhizobiales with the most abundant
   Nitrobacter winogradski (3.9\%). Isolated bacteria were then used to
   address plant growth promoting abilities, which included production of
   the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (performed by 74\% of the

   (23\%). Among the isolates, mycorrhiza helper bacteria (MHB) were

   vaccinum, supporting tree germination, shoot elongation, and root
   formation as well as higher mycorrhization rates. Thus, a huge pool of

Abstract = {{The effects of logging on forest ecosystems are severe and long-lasting.
   In addition, these effects are often paralleled with shifts in soil
   fungal community composition and functional guilds with potential
   feedbacks on ecosystem functioning. Clarifying how soil fungal
   communities are linked to the effects of historical logging could help
   us better understand the ecological consequences of logging. Here, we
   collected soils from 61 25 m x 25 m quadrats across a 160-km(2) tropical
   rainforest in Hainan Island, China, which had been partially clear cut
   or selectively harvested and left to recover for up to 50 years. Soil
   fungal community composition and species co-variation networks were
   investigated in the selectively harvested (select cut) and clear cut
   forest stands and were compared to data from the primary stands without
   a history of logging. Historical logging shifted fungal community
   composition from Zygomycota towards Basidiomycota domination mainly
   through modifying vegetation composition and soil properties. The
   relative abundance of root associated fungi (i.e., ectomycorrhizal and
   ericoid mycorrhizal), animal pathogens and wood saprotrophs increased 50
   years after logging, while the relative abundance of undefined
   saprotrophs decreased. In select cut stands, the fungal community was
   better organized with higher numbers of functionally interrelated
   operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and more generalist OTUs. In
   contrast, the number of functionally interrelated OTUs was lowest in the
   fungal network in clear cut stands. By comparing the topological roles
   of the shared OTUs among the three types of forest stands, we found
   role-shifts among fungal members from the specialists in the primary
   stands to the generalists in the select cut stands. Ascomycota and
   Basidiomycota were the major phyla involved in the role-shifts.
   Moreover, the fungal network in primary stands was positively associated
   with litter nutrients, while that in select cut stands was positively
   related to soil nutrients content. This indicated that the major drivers
   of fungal community organization shifted from litter nutrients content
   in the primary forest towards soil nutrients content in the selectively
   harvested forest. In the clear cut stands, however, the associations
   between fungal network and both litter and soil nutrients content
   decreased when compared with those in the primary and select cut stands.
   More than 60\% of the total links among fungal members in clear cut
   stands were negative, implying a trend of niche partitioning among
   fungal groups with a half-century recovery after clearcutting in the
   tropical rainforest.}},

Abstract = {{The role of mycorrhizal symbiosis as a control of the biogeochemical
   cycle of nitrogen in soils and in the nitrogen nutrition of plants is

   ectomycorrhiza (EcM) to nitrogen (N) supply of host plants is well
   known, whereas the role of arbuscular mycorrhiza (ArM) is insufficiently
   understood. Exoenzymes released into the soil from the ErM and EcM
   mycelium favor the hydrolysis of high-molecular-weight N-containing
   organic compounds of plant litter and soils to or amino acids that are
   then transported toward plant roots and are absorbed by them.
   ArM-producing fungi have a limited capacity to release hydrolytic
   enzymes capable to decompose high-molecular-weight organic compounds
   into the soil (or do not have it at all). Therefore, they are
   specialized on the absorption of inorganic forms of N and amino acids
   appearing in the soil in the course of decomposition of
   high-molecular-weight N-containing compounds by saprotrophic
   microorganisms. The activity of hydrolytic exoenzymes and the role of
   mycorrhiza in the nitrogen nutrition of plants become more significant
   under conditions of the low supply with mineral N compounds and decrease
   upon the rise in availability of mineral Ncompounds. At the same time,
   mycorrhizal fungi and host plants may compete for the limited resource.
   The isotopic composition of N in plants (N-15) and the fractionation of
   N-15 isotope between the mycorrhizal fungi and host plants are

Abstract = {{The temporal dynamics of soil bacterial communities are understudied,

   bacterial communities vary across diurnal, sub-seasonal and seasonal
   time-scales in a 5.8 m(2) plot and test the hypothesis that bacterial
   diversity varies on each of these scales. We used 16S rDNA gene amplicon
   sequencing to quantify the alpha and beta diversity of soil bacteria as
   well as the Net Relatedness Index and Nearest Taxon Indices to assess
   the degree of phylogenetic clustering, and the extent to which community
   shifts were driven by stochastic vs. deterministic limitation. We found
   that species richness was highest in winter, lowest in fall and that
   communities were compositionally distinct across seasons. There was no
   evidence of diurnal-scale shifts; the finest temporal scale over which
   community shifts were detected using our DNA-based analysis was between
   sampling dates separated by 6 weeks. Phylogenetic analyses suggested
   that seasonal-scale differences in community composition were the result
   of environmental filtering and homogeneous selection. Our findings
   provide insight into temporal variation of soil bacterial communities
   across the hourly to seasonal scales while minimizing the potential

Abstract = {{Fungi play important regulatory roles in terrestrial ecosystem
   functioning. However, fungal diversity and community composition in
   forests along gradients of plant communities at a regional scale remain

   five forest sites on Purple Mountain in Nanjing, China. Illumina
   sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 region was used for
   fungal identification. We examined the effects of vegetation type on the
   taxonomic and functional structure of the fungal community in litter.
   Fungal taxonomic and functional diversity were each significantly
   positively correlated with tree diversity and soil carbon content,
   negatively related to soil pH. At the regional scale, litter resources
   and tree species more strongly affected the diversity of fungi than did
   tree species richness. Our study suggests a predominant effect of plant
   diversity in conjunction with nutrient resources and edaphic conditions
   on litter fungal communities in subtropical ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Uncovering trophic positions and food resources of soil animals using
   bulk natural stable isotope composition}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{37-59}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Despite the major importance of soil biota in nutrient and energy
   fluxes, interactions in soil food webs are poorly understood. Here we
   provide an overview of recent advances in uncovering the trophic
   structure of soil food webs using natural variations in stable isotope
   ratios. We discuss approaches of application, normalization and
   interpretation of stable isotope ratios along with methodological
   pitfalls. Analysis of published data from temperate forest ecosystems is
   used to outline emerging concepts and perspectives in soil food web
   research. In contrast to aboveground and aquatic food webs, trophic
   fractionation at the basal level of detrital food webs is large for
   carbon and small for nitrogen stable isotopes. Virtually all soil
   animals are enriched in C-13 as compared to plant litter. This `detrital
   shift' likely reflects preferential uptake of C-13-enriched microbial
   biomass and underlines the importance of microorganisms, in contrast to
   dead plant material, as a major food resource for the soil animal
   community. Soil organic matter is enriched in N-15 and C-13 relative to
   leaf litter. Decomposers inhabiting mineral soil layers therefore might
   be enriched in N-15 resulting in overlap in isotope ratios between
   soil-dwelling detritivores and litter-dwelling predators. By contrast,
   C-13 content varies little between detritivores in upper litter and in
   mineral soil, suggesting that they rely on similar basal resources, i.e.
   little decomposed organic matter. Comparing vertical isotope gradients
   in animals and in basal resources can be a valuable tool to assess
   trophic interactions and dynamics of organic matter in soil. As
   indicated by stable isotope composition, direct feeding on living plant
   material as well as on mycorrhizal fungi is likely rare among soil
   invertebrates. Plant carbon is taken up predominantly by saprotrophic
   microorganisms and channelled to higher trophic levels of the soil food
   web. However, feeding on photoautotrophic microorganisms and
   non-vascular plants may play an important role in fuelling soil food
   webs. The trophic niche of most high-rank animal taxa spans at least two
   trophic levels, implying the use of a wide range of resources.
   Therefore, to identify trophic species and links in food webs, low-rank
   taxonomic identification is required. Despite overlap in feeding
   strategies, stable isotope composition of the high-rank taxonomic groups
   reflects differences in trophic level and in the use of basal resources.
   Different taxonomic groups of predators and decomposers are likely
   linked to different pools of organic matter in soil, suggesting
   different functional roles and indicating that trophic niches in soil
   animal communities are phylogenetically structured. During last two
   decades studies using stable isotope analysis have elucidated the
   trophic structure of soil communities, clarified basal food resources of
   the soil food web and revealed links between above- and belowground
   ecosystem compartments. Extending the use of stable isotope analysis to
   a wider range of soil-dwelling organisms, including microfauna, and a
   larger array of ecosystems provides the perspective of a comprehensive
   understanding of the structure and functioning of soil food webs.}},

Abstract = {{Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) is a hydrophobic glycoprotein that
   can protect soil organic carbon (SOC) from decomposition by promoting
   the formation of soil aggregates. Few studies, however, have evaluated
   the response of aggregate-associated SOC and GRSP to freeze-thaw cycles
   (FTs) under different patterns of vegetation restoration. Soil samples
   were collected from three typical natural-succession grasslands
   (dominated by Artemisia capalaris, A. sacrorum, and Bothriochloa
   ischaemum) and a Chinese pine (Pains tabuliformis) forest before and
   after natural FTs during a winter-spring season on the Loess Plateau in
   China. The soil aggregate stability and concentrations of SOC, easily
   extractable GRSP (EE-GRSP) and total GRSP (T-GRSP) in different
   aggregate fractions were measured. The FTs decreased the proportion of >
   5.0 mm wet-sieved fractions, increased the proportion of < 0.25 mm
   wet-sieved fractions, and decreased the mean weight diameters by 8.7,
   9.5, 2.9, and 9.4\% in the soils of A. capiilaris, A. sacrorum, B.
   ischaemum, and P. tabuliformis, respectively. The SOC, T-GRSP, and
   EE-GRSP concentrations in each aggregate fraction generally decreased
   after FTs in the four vegetation types. The SOC, T-GRSP, and EE-GRSP
   concentrations did not differ significantly in the larger aggregate
   fractions before the FTs in the soils for B. ischaemum and P.
   tabuliformis, but their concentrations were significantly higher for B.
   ischaemum than P. tabuliformis after FTs. The SOC and GRSP
   concentrations were significantly and linearly correlated in most
   aggregate fractions both before and after the FTs. These results
   indicated that the FTs decreased SOC by decreasing the GRSP
   concentration in each aggregate fraction and that SOC was more sensitive
   to FTs in forest than in natural-succession grassland.}},

Abstract = {{Pinus greggii Engelm. ex Parl. is an endemic pine of Mexico with

   Four-month-old P. greggii var. greggii seedlings were inoculated with
   ground fruiting bodies of the ECM species Astraeus spp., Boletus
   barrowsii, Geastrum minimum, Lactarius deliciosus var. deterrimus,
   Russula cf. atroglauca, Russula spp., Suillus caerulescens, as well as a

Abstract = {{Tropical secondary forests currently represent over half of the world's
   remaining tropical forests and are critical candidates for maintaining
   global biodiversity and enhancing potential carbon-use efficiency (CUE)
   and, thus, carbon sequestration. However, these ecosystems can exhibit
   multiple successional pathways, which have hindered our understanding of
   the soil microbial drivers that facilitate improved CUE. To begin to
   address this, we examined soil \% C; \% N; C:N ratio; soil microbial
   biomass C (C-mic); NO3-; NH4+; pH; \% moisture; \% sand, silt, and clay;
   and elevation, along with soil bacterial and fungal community
   composition, and determined which soil abiotic properties structure the
   soil C-mic and the soil bacterial and fungal communities across a
   primary forest, 33-year-old secondary forest, and 22-year-old young
   secondary in the Northern Zone of Costa Rica. We provide evidence that
   soil microbial communities were mostly distinct across the habitat types
   and that these habitats appear to have affected the soil ectomycorrhizal
   fungi and the soil microbial groups associated with the degradation of
   complex carbon compounds. We found that soil C-mic levels increased
   along the management gradient from young, to old secondary, to primary
   forest. In addition, the changes in soil C-mic and soil fungal community
   structure were significantly related to levels of soil NO3-. Our
   analyses showed that even after 33years of natural forest regrowth, the
   clearing of tropical forests can have persistent effects on soil
   microbial communities and that it may take a longer time than we
   realized for secondary forests to develop carbon-utilization
   efficiencies similar to that of a primary forest. Our results also
   indicated that forms of inorganic N may be an important factor in
   structuring soil C-mic and the soil microbial communities, leading to
   improved CUE in regenerating secondary forests. This study is the first
   in the region to highlight some of the factors which appear to be
   structuring the soil C-mic and soil microbial communities such that they
   are more conducive for enhanced CUE in secondary forests.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{13749-13758}},
Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal association is ubiquitous and can be found in
   majority of natural habitats. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play a
   key role in the absorption of plant nutrients, soil aggregation and
   fertility. The basic role of AMF in the plant growth is to increase the
   absorption and translocation of relatively immobile ions and elements.
   In the past, studies have focused primarily on the mycorrhiza
   development and their general role in the growth of plants. Here, in
   this review manuscript, we highlight the role of AMF in the growth of
   old forests. In many studies, it has been found that concentration of
   phosphorous (P) decreases with the stand age which as a result leads to
   phosphorous (P) deficiency. This phosphorous (P) deficiency is
   considered as a cause of slow growth of old forests. In this review
   article, we argued that apart from the low concentration of phosphorous
   (P), weak arbuscular mycorrhizal associations are also a cause of slow
   growth of old forests. Furthermore, we also highlight the ecological
   role of AMF in the soil carbon storage. AMF provide physical (hyphae
   frame) and chemical support (Glomalin) to the dispersed soil particles
   to create stable aggregated soil structure. The Glomalin compound which
   is released by AMF acts like a glue and consequently increases soil
   aggregation. The soil organic matters stored in soil aggregates are less
   exposed to decomposition. Hence, soil can be used as a large sink where
   a huge amount of carbon can be stored in the form of soil organic
   matters which as a result can contribute to the mitigation of global
   climate change.}},

Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{1. The mechanistic links between nitrogen (N) availability and
   investment in plant phosphorus (P) acquisition have important
   implications for plant growth, species distributions, and responses to
   CO2 fertilization under global change, especially in P-poor tropical
   ecosystems. Currently, it is unclear whether investment in strategies
   that enhance plant P acquisition (arbuscular mycorrhizal, AM;
   colonization or root phosphatase activity, RPA) are determined primarily
   by phylogeny, or whether these strategies differ among N-2-fixing
   legumes and nonfixing plants as a result of differing N availability.
   2. We hypothesized that plant N status, which can vary widely
   independent of N fixation, correlates with investment in P acquisition,
   because: (a) N and P concentrations scale in plant tissue indicative of
   coupled demand and (b) plants with more N may have more resources
   available to allocate to acquisition strategies.
   3. We grew seedlings of eight tropical tree species from three families
   (including three N-2-fixing and one nonfixing legume) under greenhouse
   conditions in native forest soil for four months. Species represented
   almost the full range of foliar N observed in tropical trees.
   4. Neither foliar N nor P concentrations correlated with investment in P
   acquisition. Across all species, we found an inverse relationship
   between investment in AM colonization and RPA, but this trade-off was
   unrelated to foliar N or P and did not differ between functional types
   (i.e., N-2 fixers vs. nonfixers).
   5. Within legumes (family Fabaceae), two strategies were evident that
   were unrelated to fixation status. High-fixing Inga and nonfixing
   Dialium displayed high foliar N and P concentrations and greater
   proportional investment in RPA versus AM, while lower fixing Ormosia
   species were characterized by lower foliar nutrient concentrations and
   proportionally more investment in AM.
   6. Synthesis.Investment in P acquisition strategies in tropical trees is
   not dependent on foliar N or functional group, but instead may be
   controlled in part by resource trade-offs. High diversity in nutrient
   strategies between related species cautions again the use of simple
   functional groupings to draw conclusions about nutrient acquisition in
   tropical trees.}},

Abstract = {{1. Although nitrogen-fixing plants play a crucial role in maintaining
   high ecosystem productivity, their effects on forest diversity are
   greatly debated. Legumes can reduce local diversity because of the
   fertilization effect; however, they can also facilitate species
   coexistence through complementary resource utilization.
   2. In natural forests, nitrogen requirements and biological nitrogen
   fixation (BNF) vary widely among legumes. We used leaf nitrogen isotopic
   composition to differentiate the level of BNF activity among seven
   legumes across a steep gradient of soil available nitrogen within a
   60-ha stem-mapping plot in a montane tropical rainforest in Hainan
   Island, China, and we evaluated their spatial distribution and
   neighbourhood diversity.
   3. Results show that the levels of BNF activity are tightly correlated
   with legume association to available soil nitrogen, where legumes
   associated with nitrogen-rich habitats exhibit surprisingly greater BNF
   activity and a more diverse neighbourhood.
   4. Synthesis. These findings indicate that legumes satisfy their
   nitrogen-demanding metabolism through a synergy of habitat preference
   and BNF activity. High BNF activity drives local diversity by promoting
   complementary resource utilization rather than intensifying above-ground
   competition. This may be achieved by improving litter quality and
   stimulating mycorrhizal and microbial diversity. The abundance of
   nitrogen fixers in nitrogen-rich habitats also explains how legumes
   contribute to maintaining high levels of soil nitrogen in tropical

   sporocarps in vivo are not well understood. We examined natural
   abundance isotope data to investigate this phenomenon. For this purpose,
   C, N and their stable isotopes (C-13, N-15) content of fungal sporocarps
   and their potential nutrient sources (i.e., foliage, litter, fine roots,
   wood, and soil) were investigated from two well-studied sites in Finland
   and Japan. Our results show that C-13 values of T. matsutake and other
   fungal groups are consistent with those of most studies, but a very high
   N-15 value (16.8 parts per thousand +/- 2.3) is observed in T.
   matsutake. Such isotopic pattern of fungal N-15 suggests that matsutake
   has a greater proteolytic potential to digest chemically complex
   N-15-enriched organic matter and hydrophobic hyphae. This assumption is
   further supported by a significant and positive correlation between
   C-13(cap-stipe) and N-15(cap-stipe) exclusively in T. matsutake, which
   suggests common C and N sources (protein) possible for isotopically
   enriched cap. The C-13 increase of caps relative to stipe presumably
   reflects greater contents of C-13-enriched protein than C-13-depleted
   chitin. We conclude that T. matsutake is a typical ECM fungus which
   obtains for its sporocarp development for both C and N from a common
   protein source (vs. photosynthetic carbon) present in soil organic
   matter.}},

Abstract = {{1. Fine root turnover plays a critical role in carbon and nutrient
   cycling in forest ecosystems. In this study, we focused on the most
   abundant deciduous species in Nordic countries, silver birch (Betula
   pendula Roth) and its fine root dynamics, including the amount of litter
   produced by fine roots as well as by aboveground vegetation.
   2. The minirhizotron method was used to quantify fine root longevity of
   silver birch and understory fine roots and rhizomes in northern Finland.
   Fine root biomass per basal area and ectomycorrhizal short root numbers
   per mg were also quantified. The fine root litter production was
   estimated by fine root biomass and longevity, and then compared with the
   aboveground litter collected with litter traps.
   3. Birch fine root biomass was 1.4-fold higher than that of understory
   fine roots and rhizomes (234 +/- 22, 171 +/- 19 g m(-2) respectively).
   Fine root longevity of birch (372 days) was significantly (P < 0.05)
   shorter than that of understory vegetation (643 days). The birch fine
   root longevity was positively related to root diameter and soil depth.
   Hazard analysis showed that thicker roots, long roots, roots produced
   late in the growing season, and roots growing deeper in the soil had
   relatively lower mortality hazard compared to the reference data. The
   total annual soil C input, including both birch and understory, was 283
   g C m(-2) yr(-1). The proportion of understory annual C input was 35\%
   of the total. Total annual belowground C input was 1.4-fold greater than
   that of aboveground.
   4. Our study indicated that the total annual belowground litter
   production was greater than that of the aboveground litter in a boreal
   deciduous forest stand. Therefore, more emphasis should be put to
   quantify the C cycling of both above- and belowground parts of different
   tree species as well as understory in boreal forests.}},

Abstract = {{Tree species associated with different mycorrhizal fungi play a crucial
   role in the carbon (C) cycling of forest ecosystems, while their effects
   on soil respiration (R-S) and the underlying mechanisms remain
   uncertain. In this study, we used a common garden experiment that
   included five monocultures (two arbuscular mycorrhizal - (AM) and three
   ectomycorrhizal-associated (ECM) temperate tree species) to explore the
   effects of mycorrhizal associations on the R-S and the driving factors.
   Our specific objectives were to (1) compare the R-S between the AM and
   ECM stands, and (2) explore the driving factors of the R-S. We found
   that the R-S in the AM stands was significantly greater (34.3\%) than
   that in the ECM stands. The R-S was significantly and positively
   correlated with microbial biomass C (C-mic), fine roots biomass
   (B-root), or soil water content (W-5), but negatively with forest floor
   mass (F-mass) or soil dissolved organic C content (C-dis). The
   best-fitted models of R-S explained 46.3\%, 38.3\%, and 45.4\% of the
   variations in the R-S for the AM stands, the ECM stands, and the
   combined dataset, respectively. However, the factors contributing to the
   R-S varied with mycorrhizal groups. The R-S of the AM stands was mainly
   influenced by C-mic, B-root, root C/N ratio, F-mass, and C-dis, whereas
   the R-S of the ECM stands was mainly affected by litter C/N ratio,
   C-dis, soil dissolved nitrogen content, soil temperature and W-5. These
   findings highlight the significance of shifts in AM or ECM tree
   abundance due to forest management and global change in forest C

Abstract = {{Fine roots are a dominant, but often overlooked source of carbon (C) in
   forest soils, and decomposition of this material may have important
   consequences for C storage and turnover in forest ecosystems. Forest
   harvesting modifies soil physicochemical properties and microbial
   communities, which may lead to faster decomposition rates, but the
   effect of harvesting on fine-root decomposition is rarely investigated.
   Variable-retention harvesting, where some trees are left on site after
   harvest, often results in lower soil moisture and temperature, and
   increased ectomycorrhizal diversity relative to clearcut harvesting. As
   such, this harvesting practice may influence fine-root decomposition
   rates. In Douglas-fir forests in coastal British Columbia, we measured
   fine-root (< 2 mm diameter) decomposition rates in variable-retention
   (aggregate and dispersed arrangements), clearcut, and uncut treatments,
   and determined if any effects persisted as stands aged. Within the
   variable-retention treatments, we also examined if fine-root
   decomposition rates varied with distance from retention trees or
   retention patches. Further, we determined which soil physicochemical
   variables best explained variation in fine-root carbon loss after two
   years of decomposition. Increased tree coverage slowed fine root
   decomposition; fine roots decomposed as slowly under variable-retention
   treatments as in uncut stands, and 15-19\% more carbon was retained in
   these treatments relative to the clearcut treatment. Fine roots also
   decomposed faster with increasing distance from retention patches or
   retention trees as decomposition was twofold slower in the aggregate
   centre relative to open areas, with similar patterns observed in the
   dispersed retention treatment. However, fine roots decomposed at similar
   rates in forests and stands with more advanced regeneration, suggesting
   the effects of harvesting on decomposition rates was not persistent.
   Across all sampling locations, 37\% of the variation in fine-root carbon
   loss was explained by fine-root biomass, and nitrate, potassium and
   sulphate availability. Nitrate availability was also positively
   correlated with the proportional mass of carbon lost during the
   decomposition experiment, suggesting that fine-root decomposition is
   sensitive to harvesting-induced changes in soil physicochemistry, and
   that variable-retention harvesting moderates the effects of harvesting
   on decomposition rates. These findings indicate that shortly after
   harvest, retention of even single trees can prevent the increase in
   fine-root decomposition rates associated with clearcut harvesting in
   these coastal Douglas-fir forests. Accordingly, management practices
   such as variable-retention harvesting that retain some trees in a
   cutblock may reduce soil C losses following forest harvesting.}},

   two questions: (i) Does rapid urbanization in Delhi (India) affect

   measured the AM fungal diversity at nine sites located in Delhi forests,
   which had different types of urban usage in terms of heavy vehicular

   The study revealed a significant decrease in AM fungal diversity (alpha

   extractable glomalin related soluble proteins (EE-GRSP) at polluted

   revealed significant differences in AM fungal community structure which
   could be correlated with variations in soil moisture, temperature, pH,
   carbon, and nitrogen and phosphorus levels. BEST (biota and
   environmental matching) analysis of biological and environmental samples
   revealed that soil temperature and moisture accounted for 47.6 \% of the

Abstract = {{The soil decomposer community is a primary driver of carbon cycling in
   forest ecosystems. Understanding the processes that structure this
   community is critical to our understanding of the global carbon cycle.
   In North American forests, soil fungal communities are regulated by
   grazing soil invertebrates, which are in turn controlled by the
   predatory red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus). The presence of
   these soil invertebrate taxa is known to exert direct top-down control
   via selective grazing on saprotrophic fungi, with direct consequences
   for biogeochemical cycling in soil. We investigated whether the removal
   of P. cinereus would relieve top-down control on decomposer fungal
   communities in a tri-trophic mesocosm study. Fungal communities were
   characterized using metabarcoding and high-throughput DNA sequencing.
   The beta-diversity of fungal communities differed between salamander
   presence and absence treatments with a strong effect on saprotrophic
   fungal communities. We concluded that P. cinereus, a mesopredator in the
   detritivore food chain, exerts a prominent control on the composition
   and functional diversity of fungal communities in soil through a
   multi-trophic top-down process. Given their capacity to govern the
   compositions of soil invertebrates, the activity of these amphibians may
   be important for regulating ecosystem function and nutrient cycling in

Abstract = {{Although water is a critical resource for organisms,
   microbially-mediated processes such as decomposition and nitrogen (N)
   transformations can endure within ecosystems even when water is scarce.
   To identify underlying mechanisms, we examined the genetic potential for
   fungi to contribute to specific aspects of carbon (C) and N cycling in a
   drought manipulation in Southern California grassland. In particular, we
   measured the frequency of fungal functional genes encoding enzymes that
   break down cellulose and chitin, and take up ammonium and amino acids,
   in decomposing litter. Furthermore, we used ``microbial cages{''} to
   reciprocally transplant litter and microbes between control and drought
   plots. This approach allowed us to distinguish direct effects of drought
   in the plot environment versus indirect effects via shifts in the
   microbial community or changes in litter chemistry. For every fungal
   functional gene we examined, the frequency of that gene within the
   microbial community increased significantly in drought plots compared to
   control plots. In contrast, when plot environment was held constant,
   frequencies of these fungal functional genes did not differ
   significantly between control-derived microbes versus drought-derived
   microbes, or between control-derived litter versus drought-derived
   litter. It appears that drought directly selects for fungi with the
   genetic capacity to acquire these specific C- and N-containing
   compounds. This genetic trait may allow fungi to take advantage of
   ephemeral water supplies. Altogether, proliferation of fungi with the
   genetic capacity for C and N acquisition may contribute to the
   maintenance of biogeochemical cycling under drought.}},

   has been limited research on rhizosphere soil stoichiometry, especially
   for co-existing overstory and understory plant species. We investigated
   the bulk and rhizosphere soil C:N:P stoichiometry of dominant overstory
   trees and understory shrubs (Adinandra millettii, Eurya muricata, and
   Loropetalum chinense) inPinus massoniana Lamb., Pinus elliottii Engelm.,
   and Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook. plantations in subtropical
   China. Rhizosphere soil C, N, and P concentrations and ratios increased
   significantly compared with bulk soil, and those of overstory trees were
   higher than those of understory shrubs with the exception of L.
   chinense. Rhizosphere soil C:N, C:P, and N:P of L. chinense were not
   significantly different with those of overstory trees but were higher
   than those of A. millettii and E. muricata. Soil pH significantly
   influenced the profiles produced by soil C, N, and P concentrations and
   their stoichiometries. This study indicated that the difference in
   nutrient status between overstory trees and understory shrubs was
   related to shrub species, in which soil pH was the dominant driving
   factor. Understory shrub species should be considered in plantation
   management to reduce resource competition among species.}},

Abstract = {{Ferriferous savannas, also known as cangas in Brazil, are
   nutrient-impoverished ecosystems adapted to seasonal droughts. These
   ecosystems support distinctive vegetation physiognomies and high plant
   diversity, although little is known about how nutrient and water
   availability shape these ecosystems. Our study was carried out in the
   cangas from Carajas, eastern Amazonia, Brazil. To investigate the N
   cycling and drought adaptations of different canga physiognomies and
   compare the findings with those from other ecosystems, we analyzed
   nutrient concentrations and isotope ratios (C-13 and N-15) of plants,
   litter, and soils from 36 plots distributed in three physiognomies:
   typical scrubland (SB), Vellozia scrubland (VL), and woodland (WD).
   Foliar N-15 values in cangas were higher than those in savannas but
   lower than those in tropical forests, indicating more conservative N
   cycles in Amazonian cangas than in forests. The lower N-15 in savanna
   formations may be due to a higher importance of mycorrhizal species in
   savanna vegetation than in canga vegetation. Elevated C-13 values
   indicate higher water shortage in canga ecosystems than in forests.
   Foliar and litter nutrient concentrations vary among canga
   physiognomies, indicating differences in nutrient dynamics. Lower
   nutrient availability, higher C:N ratios, and lower N-15 values
   characterize VL, whereas WD is delineated by lower C-13 values and
   higher soil P. These results suggest lower water restriction and lower P
   limitation in WD, whereas VL shows more conserved N cycles due to lower
   nutrient availability. Differences in nutrient and water dynamics among
   physiognomies indicate different ecological processes; thus, the
   conservation of all physiognomies is required to ensure the maintenance
   of functional diversity in this unique ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient amendment increases plant productivity but the effects and
   mechanisms on soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and stability
   remain unclear, especially in nutrient deficient alpine ecosystem. Here,
   based on an experiment combining nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) input
   continuously for 15 years, we found that nutrient amendment did not
   affect total SOC content, but increased mineral-associated C with
   decreasing soil aggregate stability. Despite increased total
   phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and bacteria PLFA, nutrient amendment
   decreased soil enzyme activities involved in C cycling. The C-13 NMR
   analyses showed that nutrient amendment decreased the aliphaticity but
   enhanced aromaticity of SOC. Structural equation models indicated that P
   availability (Olsen-P content) was most related to shifts in microbial
   community composition and decreased enzyme activities. Moreover, the
   concomitantly reduced aggregation and increased mineral-associated C
   were mainly attributable to the decrease of fungal biomass and increase
   of bacterial biomass. Together, interconnected factors such as increased
   acidity, aggregate destabilization, microbial community shift towards
   bacteria, and loss of oxidative enzyme activities could contribute to
   the overall response of SOC under intensive N and P input. In
   particular, available P rather than N may re-shape the pattern of
   physical and chemical stabilization of SOC, shifting from moderately
   physical protection to highly chemical stability, implicating the
   pivotal roles of P management in C cycling of alpine ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial necromass is now recognized as an important input into stable
   soil organic matter pools in terrestrial ecosystems. While melanin and
   nitrogen content have been identified as factors that influence the
   decomposition rate of fungal necromass, the effects of mycelial
   morphology on necromass decomposition remain largely unknown. Using the
   fungus Armillaria mellea, which produces both diffuse and rhizomorphic
   biomass in pure culture, we assessed the effects of necromass morphology
   on decomposition in a 12 week field experiment in Pinus and Quercus
   dominated forests in Minnesota, USA. Diffuse and rhizomorphic necromass
   was incubated for 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks to assess differences in decay
   rates and changes in residual necromass chemistry. Rhizomorphic
   necromass decomposed significantly slower than diffuse necromass in both
   forest types. This difference was correlated with initial necromass
   chemistry, particularly nitrogen content, but not with hydrophobicity.
   Over the course of the incubation, there was a greater change in the
   chemistry of diffuse versus rhizomorphic necromass, with both becoming
   more enriched in recalcitrant compounds. Given that many fungi with both
   saprotrophic and mycorrhizal ecologies produce rhizomorphs, these

Abstract = {{The presence of living roots can markedly change soil properties,
   microbial activities, and biogeochemical cycling in the rhizosphere
   compared to bulk soil. Such rhizosphere effect has been increasingly
   recognized to play a crucial role in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling
   in terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we investigated the rhizosphere effects
   of 12 tree species associated with two contrasting mycorrhizal types
   (arbuscular mycorrhizal, AM vs. ectomycorrhizal, ECM) and co-occurring
   in a temperate secondary forest in Northeast China. The adhering soil
   method was adopted to sample paired rhizosphere and bulk soils of
   field-grown trees in the peak growing season. Generally, we found
   positive rhizosphere effects on soil properties (ammonium and nitrate
   content, total C and N content, and C:N ratio), microbial abundances
   (bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes), enzyme activities (C- and
   N-degradation enzymes), and C mineralization rate (C-min), but minor
   rhizosphere effects on soil pH, phosphorus content and phosphatase
   activity, net N mineralization rate (N-min), and specific C-min and
   N-min. (per unit soil C or N). Because of large intraspecific and
   particularly interspecific variations, less than half of the rhizosphere
   effects were statistically significant (P < 0.05), and none of the
   rhizosphere effects differed significantly between the two mycorrhizal
   types (AM vs. ECM). Moreover, most soil variables varied greatly within
   and across species, and thus did not differ significantly between the
   two mycorrhizal types (AM vs. ECM). However, soil pH, nitrate content,
   microbial abundance, and C-degradation enzyme activity were notably
   lower under ECM species than under AM species. Collectively, these
   results show that rhizosphere effects varied greatly among the six
   species within both mycorrhizal groups, and such variations within
   mycorrhizal group were even larger than those between mycorrhizal group.
   Future work should include a larger number of tree species to increase
   statistical power, and combine phylogenic history and functional traits
   of plant species with the type and traits of mycorrhizal fungi to better
   understand how plant-microbe interactions influence biogeochemical

   fertilizer (NP), organic manure (M) and combined fertilizer (NPM) by the
   Illumina HiSeq sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR to target
   fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes. The results show: (1)
   compared to the unfertilized soil, fertilizer application increased
   fungal diversity and ITS gene copy numbers, and shifted fungal community
   structure. Such changes were more pronounced in the M and NPM soils than
   in the NP soil (except for fungal diversity), which can be largely
   attributed to the manure induced greater increases in soil total organic
   C, total N and available P. (2) Compared to the unfertilized soil, the
   NP and NPM soils reduced the proportion of saprotrophs by 40\%, the
   predominant taxa of which may potentially affect cellulose

   25.6\% of its total community, but that only accounted for 0.9\% in the

Abstract = {{Decomposition is a key component of the global carbon (C) cycle, yet
   current ecosystem C models do not adequately represent the contributions
   of plant roots and their mycorrhizae to this process. The understanding
   of decomposition dynamics and their control by traits is particularly
   limited for the most distal first-order roots. Here we followed
   decomposition of first-order roots and leaf litter from 35 woody plant
   species differing in mycorrhizal type over 6 years in a Chinese
   temperate forest. First-order roots decomposed more slowly (k = 0.11 +/-
   0.01 years(-1)) than did leaf litter (0.35 +/- 0.02 years(-1)), losing
   only 35\% of initial mass on average after 6 years of exposure in the
   field. In contrast to leaf litter, nonlignin root C chemistry
   (nonstructural carbohydrates, polyphenols) accounted for 82\% of the
   large interspecific variation in first-order root decomposition. Leaf
   litter from ectomycorrhizal (EM) species decomposed more slowly than
   that from arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) species, whereas first-order roots
   of EM species switched, after 2 years, from having slower to faster
   decomposition compared with those from AM species. The fundamentally
   different dynamics and control mechanisms of first-order root
   decomposition compared with those of leaf litter challenge current
   ecosystem C models, the recently suggested dichotomy between EM and AM
   plants, and the idea that common traits can predict decomposition across
   roots and leaves. Aspects of C chemistry unrelated to lignin or
   nitrogen, and not presently considered in decomposition models,
   controlled first-order root decomposition; thus, current paradigms of
   ecosystem C dynamics and model parameterization require revision.}},

Abstract = {{Deconvoluting the relative contributions made by specific biotic and
   abiotic drivers to soil fungal community compositions facilitates
   predictions about the functional responses of ecosystems to
   environmental changes, such as losses of plant diversity, but it is
   hindered by the complex interactions involved. Experimental assembly of
   tree species allows separation of the respective effects of plant
   community composition (biotic components) and soil properties (abiotic
   components), enabling much greater statistical power than can be
   achieved in observational studies. We therefore analyzed these
   contributions by assessing, via pyrotag sequencing of the internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS2) rDNA region, fungal communities in young
   subtropical forest plots included in a large experiment on the effects
   of tree species richness. Spatial variables and soil properties were the
   main drivers of soil fungal alpha and beta-diversity, implying strong
   early-stage environmental filtering and dispersal limitation. Tree
   related variables, such as tree community composition, significantly
   affected arbuscular mycorrhizal and pathogen fungal community structure,
   while differences in tree host species and host abundance affected
   ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition. At this early stage of the
   experiment, only a limited amount of carbon inputs (rhizodeposits and
   leaf litter) was being provided to the ecosystem due to the size of the
   tree saplings, and persisting legacy effects were observed. We thus
   expect to find increasing tree related effects on fungal community
   composition as forest development proceeds.}},

   higher temperature (22 degrees C versus 16 degrees C) increased the

   for fungal growth (lignin versus sucrose) had a much greater impact on
   enzyme Vmax than temperature. Following experimental evolution, the

Abstract = {{Improved understanding of the nutritional ecology of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is important in understanding how tropical
   forests maintain high productivity on low-fertility soils. Relatively
   little is known about how AM fungi will respond to changes in nutrient
   inputs in tropical forests, which hampers our ability to assess how
   forest productivity will be influenced by anthropogenic change. Here we
   assessed the influence of long-term inorganic and organic nutrient
   additions and nutrient depletion on AM fungi, using two adjacent
   experiments in a lowland tropical forest in Panama. We characterised AM
   fungal communities in soil and roots using 454-pyrosequencing, and
   quantified AM fungal abundance using microscopy and a lipid biomarker.
   Phosphorus and nitrogen addition reduced the abundance of AM fungi to a
   similar extent, but affected community composition in different ways.
   Nutrient depletion (removal of leaf litter) had a pronounced effect on
   AM fungal community composition, affecting nearly as many OTUs as
   phosphorus addition. The addition of nutrients in organic form (leaf
   litter) had little effect on any AM fungal parameter. Soil AM fungal
   communities responded more strongly to changes in nutrient availability
   than communities in roots. This suggests that the `dual niches' of AM
   fungi in soil versus roots are structured to different degrees by
   abiotic environmental filters, and biotic filters imposed by the plant
   host. Our findings indicate that AM fungal communities are fine-tuned to
   nutrient regimes, and support future studies aiming to link AM fungal

Abstract = {{Rapid responses of microbial biomass and community composition following
   a precipitation event have been reported for soil bacteria and fungi,
   but measurements characterizing ectomycorrhizal fungi remain limited.
   The response of ectomycorrhizal fungi after a precipitation event is
   crucial to understanding biogeochemical cycles and plant nutrition.
   Here, we examined changes in ectomycorrhizal formation, diversity, and
   community composition at the end of a summer drought and following
   precipitation events in a conifer-oak mixed forest under a semiarid,
   Mediterranean-type climate in CA, USA. To study the effects of different
   amounts of precipitation, a water addition treatment was also
   undertaken. Ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and community composition
   changed within 6 days following precipitation, with increased
   simultaneous mortality and re-growth. Ectomycorrhizal diversity
   increased and community composition changed both in the natural rainfall
   (less than 10 mm) and water addition (50 mm) treatments, but larger
   decreases in ectomycorrhizal diversity were observed from 9 to 16 days
   after precipitation in the water addition treatment. The changes were
   primarily a shift in richness and abundance of Basidiomycota species,
   indicating higher drought sensitivity of Basidiomycota species compared
   with Ascomycota species. Our results indicate that ectomycorrhizal
   formation, diversity, and community composition rapidly respond to both
   precipitation events and to the amount of precipitation. These changes
   affect ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling, decomposition, and
   plant nutrient uptake, in semiarid regions.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how soil processes, belowground plant and fungal species
   composition, and nutrient cycles are altered by disturbances is
   essential for understanding the role forests play in mitigating global
   climate change. Here we ask: How are root and fungal communities altered
   in a mid-successional forest during shifts in dominant tree species
   composition? This study utilizes the Forest Accelerated Succession
   ExperimenT (FASET) at the University of Michigan Biological Station
   (UMBS) as a platform for addressing this question. FASET consists of a
   39-ha treatment in which all mature early successional aspen (Populus
   spp.) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) were killed by stem-girdling
   in 2008. Four years after girdling, neither overall fungal diversity
   indices, plant diversity indices, nor root biomass differed between
   girdled (treated) and non-girdled (reference) stands. However,
   experimental advancement of succession by removal of aspen and birch
   resulted in 1) a shift in fungal functional groups, with significantly
   less ectomycorrhizal fungi, 2) a trend toward less arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi, and 3) a significant increase in the proportion of
   saprotrophs in girdled stands. In addition to shifts in functional
   groups between treated and untreated stands, ectomycorrhizal fungi
   proportions were negatively correlated with NH4+ and total dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in soil. This research illustrates the
   propensity for disturbances in forest ecosystems to shift fungal
   community composition, which has implications for carbon storage and
   nutrient cycling in soils under future climate scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Global changes such as atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition can alter the

   increased species richness and relative abundance of yeasts in the total

Abstract = {{Human-driven increases in bioavailable nitrogen over the last century

   that increasing inorganic nitrogen strongly influences the diversity and

   nitrogen addition, the predominant form of nitrogen in soils, remains
   less clear. In this study, we conducted a field experiment manipulating
   both the amount and composition of soil organic nitrogen present in soil
   fungal in-growth bags, followed by molecular characterization of fungal
   communities after a four-month incubation. Saprotrophic and
   ectomycorrhizal fungi readily colonized experimental in-growth bags,
   indicating a broad overlap in the fundamental niches of these two
   functional guilds. Increases in labile forms of organic nitrogen
   resulted in sharp declines in species richness and diversity across
   fungal guilds, as well as notable shifts in fungal community
   composition. The relative abundance of fungi classified as molds and
   yeasts peaked where organic nitrogen was both high and most labile,
   whereas slower-growing saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi were more
   abundant in the non-amended treatments. Taken together, our results

Abstract = {{Common ecological restoration treatments such as thinning trees and

   produce extracellular enzymes that are important in soil nutrient
   cycling. We conducted a community survey of ectomycorrhizal fungi and
   assayed ectomycorrhizal root tip enzyme activity using substrate plugs
   in northern Mississippi upland oak-pine woodland plots differing in
   restoration history to explore the influence of woodland restoration on
   ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition and function. Restoration
   treatment was significant in explaining the occurrence of the most

Abstract = {{Tropical tree and lianas in the understory are limited by soil nutrients

   We measured differences in root architecture and mycorrhizal
   colonization, and leaf nutrients of a nomadic vine, Philodendron
   fragrantissimum (Araceae), in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)
   fertilization plots in a lowland tropical moist forest in central Panama
   to measure potential nutrient limitation.
   Relative to plants in control plots, leaf P concentration was 54\%
   higher and leaf N concentration was 10\% higher for plants in the P- and
   N-addition treatments, respectively. The N:P of leaves suggested
   P-limitation in the N-addition treatment and the control but not in the
   P-addition treatment. Root branching was highest in the P-addition
   treatment, and P-addition reduced mycorrhizal colonization.
   The large effect of P fertilization suggests that, like many tropical
   plants, P. fragrantissimum has the potential to be P-limited. Although
   further study is needed, we suggest that nomadic vines be added to the
   growth forms that respond to nutrient addition in the forest understory

   soil were screened for associated fungi. The fungal community was
   assessed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses in
   a predatory (Leptogamasus obesus) and a predominantly saprobic (Oppiella
   subpectinata) mite species as well as in the organic soil layer. Key
   fungi were identified by sequencing, and community composition was

   Composition of the fungal communities differed between mite species and
   between mites and organic soil layer. The mites were predominantly
   associated with Zygomycota, less frequently with Ascomycota, and rarely
   with Basidiomycota. The bulk soil was colonized by roughly equal
   proportions of the three phyla. Fungal taxa being known to exhibit
   chitinolytic activity were predominantly restricted to mites.
   Compositional and functional differences between the communities suggest

Abstract = {{Ecological forest succession can be influenced by plant-plant
   interactions that exert contrasting effects on early- and
   late-successional species. In this study, we explored the role of
   indirect plant-plant interactions and the underlying microbial
   mechanisms in forest succession.
   In a mesocosm experiment, we used Schima superba, a widespread
   mid-successional species in subtropical China, as a model species to
   explore how inoculating the rhizosphere soil of Schima affected the
   performances of two early-successional species (Pinus massoniana and
   Rhodomyrtus tomentosa) and two late-successional species (Cryptocarya
   chinensis and Machilus chinensis). All direct and indirect correlations
   between plant performance and soil microbial composition were examined
   using partial least square path models.
   Schima inoculum inhibited the growth of the early-successional species
   but had little effect on the growth of the late-successional species.
   Inoculation reduced non-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (non-AMF)
   colonization in both species groups but increased arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi (AMF) colonization in the late-successional species. The
   percentage of root lesions in the early-successional species increased
   with inoculation, while that in the late-successional species decreased.
   Plant nutrient acquisition was not responsive to inoculation. According
   to the path models, soil microbes explained 51\% of the growth variances
   in the early-successional species but barely explained any growth
   variances in the late species.
   Schima may increase the competitive advantage of the late-successional
   species over early-successional species by inhibiting the mutualistic
   association between non-AMF and the latter, which in turn may facilitate
   forest succession.}},

Abstract = {{Managers use restorative fire and thinning for ecological benefits and
   to convert fuel-heavy forests to fuel-lean landscapes that lessen the
   threat of stand-replacing wildfire. In this study, we evaluated the
   long-term impact of thinning and prescribed fire on soil biochemistry
   and the mycorrhizal fungi associated with ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa). Study sites were located in the Blue Mountains of
   northeastern Oregon where prescribed fire treatments implemented in 1998
   and thinning treatments in 2000 included prescribed fire, mechanical
   thinning of forested areas, a combination of thinning followed by fire,
   and an untreated control. Soil sampling for this study occurred in 2014
   and included four replications of each treatment for a total of 16
   experimental units. Differences among treatments in Bray-P, total C and
   N, and pH were likely driven by the thinning treatments and the
   resultant deposition of residual slash following harvesting or the
   consumption of slash by prescribed fire. Similar litter depths across
   treatments suggest that litter depth stabilizes over time in these
   forests. After more than a decade of recovery, mycorrhizal fungi in dry
   inland forests dominated by ponderosa pine that were subjected to fire
   returned to levels similar to the untreated controls. The results of
   this study demonstrate the resiliency of these forests to disturbances
   associated with restoration treatments, providing managers increased
   flexibility if maintaining abundant and persistent fungal communities
   for healthy soils is an objective.}},

Abstract = {{Forest soils store large amounts of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), yet how
   predicted shifts in forest composition will impact long-term C and N
   persistence remains poorly understood. A recent hypothesis predicts that
   soils under trees associated with arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) store less
   C than soils dominated by trees associated with ectomycorrhizas (ECM),
   due to slower decomposition in ECM-dominated forests. However, an
   incipient hypothesis predicts that systems with rapid
   decompositione-e.g. most AM-dominated forestsenhance soil organic matter
   (SOM) stabilization by accelerating the production of microbial
   residues. To address these contrasting predictions, we quantified soil C
   and N to 1 m depth across gradients of ECM-dominance in three temperate
   forests. By focusing on sites where AM- and ECM-plants co-occur, our
   analysis controls for climatic factors that covary with mycorrhizal
   dominance across broad scales. We found that while ECM stands contain
   more SOM in topsoil, AM stands contain more SOM when subsoil to 1 m
   depth is included. Biomarkers and soil fractionations reveal that these
   patterns are driven by an accumulation of microbial residues in
   AM-dominated soils. Collectively, our results support emerging theory on
   SOM formation, demonstrate the importance of subsurface soils in
   mediating plant effects on soil C and N, and indicate that shifts in the
   mycorrhizal composition of temperate forests may alter the stabilization
   of SOM.}},

Abstract = {{Saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) forest fungi decompose organic
   matter and mobilize nutrients for host plants, respectively. Competition
   between the two guilds may cause the so-called Gadgil effect, i.e.,
   decreased litter decomposition rates resulting in increased carbon
   storage in soil. The Gadgil effect was supposed to even affect global
   climate, highlighting the necessity to understand fungal distribution
   and interactions in soil. Searching for evidence of competition between
   saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi, we analyzed the distribution of
   fungi along a well-stratified vertical spruce forest soil profile in two
   seasons, i.e., autumn and the following spring. The different soil
   strata (i.e., two mineral horizons and two organic layers) underneath
   the litter layer were colonized by distinct fungal communities, which
   included roughly consistent proportions of all fungal guilds and phyla
   at each time. However, the community composition changed quantitatively
   between the sampling dates. Along the vertical soil profile, it differed
   mostly between the organic layers and the mineral soil, which is
   supposed to be due to differences in the predominant energy sources
   (i.e., aboveground litter and rhizodeposition, respectively). Network
   analyses revealed co-occurrences (i.e., positive correlations of
   individual abundances) to outweigh mutual exclusions (i.e., negative
   correlations) between individual fungi in each soil stratum and season.
   This also applied for interactions between saprotrophic and EcM fungi.
   Network analyses therefore provided no indications for a possible Gadgil
   effect. However, considering individual nutrient use efficiencies might
   refine insights from network analyses in future studies and facilitate
   linking community dynamics to ecosystem processes.}},

Volume = {{123}},

Abstract = {{While multiple lines of evidence suggests that root carbon (C) can
   significantly impact the soil organic C (SOC) pool and subsequent C
   cycles via rhizosphere priming effects, the relative magnitude of the
   effects that root- and fungal-derived C inputs have in driving the
   priming of SOC decomposition are currently unknown. In this study, we
   used ingrowth cores and stable C isotope analyses to quantify root- and
   mycelium-derived C sequestered in soil labile and recalcitrant C pools
   and their relative contributions to the decomposition of native SOC in a
   spruce-fir-dominated coniferous forest on the eastern Tibetan Plateau,
   China. The results showed that new C sequestered in the soil labile C
   pool was primarily (77\%) from mycelium-derived C, while 60\% of the
   root derived C sequestered in the soil was incorporated into the
   recalcitrant pool. Furthermore, although the total native SOC pool was
   not significantly influenced by new C derived from both roots and
   mycelia, mycelium derived C induced a remarkably greater negative
   priming effect (-12.0\%) on the native labile C pool than did
   root-derived C (-5.8\%); in contrast, mycelium-derived C induced a
   greater positive priming effect (13.8\%) than root-derived C (7.1\%) on
   the native recalcitrant C pool. Collectively, our findings suggest that
   mycelium-derived C make a greater contribution to the newly sequestered
   C in the soil labile C pool than root-derived C, thereby inducing a
   remarkably greater positive priming effect on the decomposition of
   native soil recalcitrant C. Therefore, mycelium-derived C inputs may
   play a dominant role in soil C dynamics and long-term C storage, at
   least in alpine forest ecosystems where ectomycorrhizal mutualisms

Abstract = {{Fire at the dry southern margin of the Amazon rainforest could have
   major consequences for regional soil carbon (C) storage and ecosystem
   carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, but relatively little information exists
   about impacts of fire on soil C cycling within this sensitive ecotone.
   We measured CO2 effluxes from different soil components (ground surface
   litter, roots, mycorrhizae, soil organic matter) at a large-scale burn
   experiment designed to simulate a severe but realistic potential future
   scenario for the region (Fire plot) in Mato Grosso, Brazil, over 1year,
   and compared these measurements to replicated data from a nearby,
   unmodified Control plot. After four burns over 5 years, soil CO2 efflux
   (R-s) was similar to 5.5 t C ha(-1) year(-1) lower on the Fire plot
   compared to the Control. Most of the Fire plot R-s reduction was
   specifically due to lower ground surface litter and root respiration.
   Mycorrhizal respiration on both plots was around similar to 20\% of R-s.
   Soil surface temperature appeared to be more important than moisture as
   a driver of seasonal patterns in R-s at the site. Regular fire events
   decreased the seasonality of R-s at the study site, due to apparent
   differences in environmental sensitivities among biotic and abiotic soil
   components. These findings may contribute toward improved predictions of
   the amount and temporal pattern of C emissions across the large areas of
   tropical forest facing increasing fire disturbances associated with
   climate change and human activities.}},

Abstract = {{While we know that understory vegetation affects the soil microbial
   biomass and extracellular enzyme activities in subtropical Chinese fir
   (Cunninghamia lanceolata) forests, we are less certain about the degree
   of its influence. We determined the degree to which the soil abiotic and
   biotic properties, such as PLFAs and extracellular enzyme activities,
   were controlled by understory vegetation. We established a paired
   treatment in a subtropical Chinese fir plantation, which comprised one
   plot from which the understory vegetation and litter were removed (None)
   and another from which the litter was removed but the understory
   vegetation was left intact (Understory). We evaluated how the understory
   vegetation influenced the soil abiotic properties, the bacterial,
   fungal, and actinobacterial PLFAs, and the activities of five hydrolases
   and two oxidative enzymes. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   particulate organic carbon, soil organic carbon, ammonia nitrogen
   (NH4+-N), and total nitrogen contents and soil moisture were 18 \%, 25
   \%, 12 \%, 34 \%, 8 \%, and 4\% lower in the None treatments than in the
   Understory treatments, respectively (P < 0.05). Soil bacterial, fungal,
   and total PLFAs, and the potential activities of beta-1,4-glucosidase
   (beta G), beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, phenol oxidase, and
   peroxidase, were as much as 24\% lower in None treatments than in
   Understory treatments (P < 0.05). The specific activities of C-acquiring
   enzymes were as much as 41\% higher (P < 0.05), and the ratio of C- to
   N-acquiring enzymes was also higher in the None treatments than in the
   Understory treatments. This suggests that in the absence of understory
   vegetation microbes invested more in C acquisition than N acquisition
   because the carbon (C) inputs were less labile. The negative
   relationship between DOC and AP shows that DOC is consumed when
   P-acquiring enzymes are produced. The positive correlation between
   NH4+-N and beta G suggested the increased availability of N promoted the
   decomposition of C. More extracellular enzymes that degrade soil organic
   matter are produced when there is understory vegetation, which leads to
   losses of soil C. On the other hand, the soil C sink is maintained by
   increased inputs of C. We can therefore conclude that understory
   vegetation contributes to C sequestration in Chinese fir forests and
   suggest that understory should be maintained to sustain soil quality in
   subtropical Chinese fir plantations.}},

Abstract = {{The American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was once an integral part of
   eastern United States deciduous forests, with many environmental,
   economic, and social values. This ended with the introduction of an
   invasive fungal pathogen that wiped out over three billion trees.
   Transgenic American chestnuts expressing a gene for oxalate oxidase
   successfully tolerate infections by this blight fungus, but potential
   non-target environmental effects should be evaluated before new
   restoration material is released. Two greenhouse bioassays evaluated
   belowground interactions between transgenic American chestnuts and
   neighboring organisms found in their native ecosystems. Potential
   allelopathy was tested by germinating several types of seeds, all native
   to American chestnut habitats, in the presence of chestnut leaf litter.
   Germination was not significantly different in terms of number of seeds
   germinated or total biomass of germinated seedlings in transgenic and
   non-transgenic leaf litter. Separately, ectomycorrhizal associations
   were observed on transgenic and non-transgenic American chestnut roots
   using field soil inoculum. Root tip colonization was consistently high
   (>90\% colonization) on all plants and not significantly different
   between any tree types. These observations on mycorrhizal fungi
   complement previous studies performed on older transgenic lines which
   expressed oxalate oxidase at lower levels. Along with other
   environmental impact comparisons, these conclusions provide further
   evidence that transgenic American chestnuts are not functionally
   different with regard to ecosystem interactions than non-transgenic

Abstract = {{Aim: Trees associating with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi typically occur
   in infertile soils and use nutrients more conservatively than arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) trees. We hypothesized that ECM trees would have
   greater nutrient resorption (i.e., proportion of nutrients resorbed
   during leaf senescence) than AM trees.
   Location: Global.
   Methods: We synthesized nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) resorption data
   from 378 species from sub/tropical, temperate and boreal forests,
   including 43 studies where ECM and AM trees cooccurred, and conducted a
   meta-analysis. Additionally, we quantified N resorption in 45 plots
   varying in ECM-AM tree abundances in the temperate deciduous forests of
   southern Indiana, USA.
   Results: Overall, resorption patterns were driven primarily by
   mycorrhizal type, climate zone, and to a lesser degree, leaf habit. In
   the boreal forest, P resorption was 76\% greater for ECM than AM trees
   (p < .05). In the sub/tropics, AM trees resorbed 30\% more N than ECM
   trees. At the sites where AM and ECM trees co-occurred, ECM trees
   resorbed more N in temperate forests (15\% greater; p < .001) whereas AM
   trees tended to resorb more N in sub/tropical forests (by 29\%; p5.08).
   Besides, deciduous ECM trees resorbed more N (10\%) and P (15\%) than
   deciduous AM trees, while evergreen ECM and AM trees did not differ. In
   the deciduous forests of Indiana, where ECM and AM trees co-occurred,
   the relative abundance of ECM trees in a plot was positively correlated
   to plot-scale N resorption (R-2 = 5.25, p=.001), indicating greater
   nutrient conservatism with increasing ECM-dominance.
   Main conclusions: Our results indicate that mycorrhizal association - in
   addition to other factors - is correlated with the degree to which trees
   recycle nutrients, with the strongest effects occurring for N resorption
   by temperate deciduous trees.}},

Abstract = {{Forest soils represent important terrestrial carbon (C) pools where C is
   primarily fixed in the plant-derived biomass but it flows further
   through the biomass of fungi and bacteria before it is lost from the
   ecosystem as CO2 or immobilized in recalcitrant organic matter.
   Microorganisms are the main drivers of C flow in forests and play
   critical roles in the C balance through the decomposition of dead
   biomass of different origins. Here, we track the path of C that enters
   forest soil by following respiration, microbial biomass production, and
   C accumulation by individual microbial taxa in soil microcosms upon the
   addition of C-13-labeled biomass of plant, fungal, and bacterial origin.
   We demonstrate that both fungi and bacteria are involved in the
   assimilation and mineralization of C from the major complex sources
   existing in soil. Decomposer fungi are, however, better suited to
   utilize plant biomass compounds, whereas the ability to utilize fungal
   and bacterial biomass is more frequent among bacteria. Due to the
   ability of microorganisms to recycle microbial biomass, we suggest that
   the decomposer food web in forest soil displays a network structure with
   loops between and within individual pools. These results question the
   present paradigms describing food webs as hierarchical structures with
   unidirectional flow of C and assumptions about the dominance of fungi in

Abstract = {{During long-term ecosystem development and its associated decline in
   soil phosphorus (P) availability, the abundance of mycorrhizal plant
   species declines at the expense of non-mycorrhizal species with root
   specialisations for P-acquisition, such as massive exudation of
   carboxylates. Leaf manganese (Mn) concentration has been suggested as a
   proxy for such a strategy, Mn concentration being higher in
   non-mycorrhizal plants that release carboxylates than in mycorrhizal
   plants. Shifts in nitrogen (N)-acquisition strategies also occur;
   nodulation in legumes is expected at low N availability, when sufficient
   P is available. We investigated whether two congeneric legume species
   (Bossiaea linophylla and Bossiaea eriocarpa) occurring along two
   long-term chronosequences on the south-western Australian coast and
   grown in a glasshouse at varying N and P supply exhibited plasticity in
   nutrient-acquisition strategies. We hypothesised that the shifts in
   nutrient limitation and nutrient-acquisition strategies at the community
   level would also be found at the species level. Leaf N: P ratios and the
   responses to nutrient availability suggested that growth of both species
   exhibited P-limitation in all treatments, due to the very high leaf
   {[}N] of legumes afforded by symbiotic N-fixation. Mycorrhizal
   colonisation was not greater at higher P supply, and root exudation of
   carboxylates was not stimulated at low P supply; both were unrelated to
   leaf {[}Mn]. However, nodule production declined with increasing N
   supply. We conclude that intraspecific variation in nutrient-acquisition
   and use is low in these species, and that the variation at the community
   level, observed in previous studies, is likely driven by high-species
   turnover.}},

Abstract = {{The Neotropics are among the least explored regions from a mycological
   perspective. A few recent molecular studies in South America have shown
   high fungal diversity as well as numerous groups of mostly undescribed
   taxa. Through soil metabarcoding analysis we compared richness and
   species composition among macrofungal communities, belonging to
   Agaricales, Russulales, Boletales and Phallomycetidae groups, in three
   elevational forests types in the subtropical Yungas of Northwestern
   Argentina (Piedmont forest; Montane forest, Montane cloud forest). The
   aims of this study were to assess richness of taxonomic and functional
   groups along the elevation gradient and to assess the relationships
   between environmental variables and species composition in the studied
   fungal communities. The results have shown rich Agaricomycetes
   communities, diversely structured among forests habitats. The elevation
   gradient differentially affected the richness and distribution of
   Agaricales, Russulales, Boletales and Phallomycetidae. Based on fungal
   trophic modes and guilds, the gradient also affected the ectomycorrhizal
   taxa distribution. When considering the basidiomata growth forms
   (agaricoid, boletoid, gasteroid, etc.), only the secotioid type showed
   significant elevational differences. Additional analyses indicated that
   saprotrophic nutritional mode was dominant along the entire gradient,
   being partially replaced by biotrophic modes at higher elevations.
   Fungal communities in the Montane cloud forests are most dissimilar when
   compared with communities at the Piedmont forest and Montane forest,
   which is consistent with the different biogeographic origins of these
   forests. DNA metabarcoding sequence analysis provided detailed
   information on the diversity and taxonomic and functional composition of
   macrofungal communities.}},

Abstract = {{A Mg isotope study of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) in a field
   site in southern Quebec, Canada, and seedlings grown in sterile soil
   substrate in the laboratory, both demonstrate per mil level within-tree
   Mg isotope fractionation. However, only sugar maple seedlings grown in
   the laboratory fractionate Mg isotopes during uptake into fine roots,
   favoring heavy isotope enrichment in the plant compared to the growth
   medium. Absence of uptake-related Mg isotope fractionation in field
   stands of sugar maple is tentatively attributed to the activities of the
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that colonize fine roots of the trees in
   the field, but were absent from the laboratory grown specimens. The
   fungi facilitate nutrient uptake for the tree, while the tree provides
   valuable carbohydrates to the fungi. Without the symbiotic fungi,
   pot-grown trees in the laboratory are visibly stressed and often die.
   The mechanisms responsible for Mg isotopic fractionation in stressed
   trees remain to be elucidated. Rivers are isotopically light compared to
   bedrock weathering sources of Mg, and this has bearing on the delta
   Mg-26 value of the continental weathering flux of Mg to the oceans,
   which is an important parameter in studies of ocean Mg cycling in the
   geological past. If uptake-related fractionation is negligible in many
   other naturally growing tree species, as it is in sugar maple, then
   forest growth will exert little or no influence on the delta Mg-26 value
   of the export flux of Mg to first-order streams and rivers, and in turn
   the ocean Mg cycle. Above the tree line, preferential retention of heavy
   Mg isotopes in clay minerals formed during silicate weathering has been
   linked to the low delta Mg-26 values in rivers. In the forested
   catchment of this study there is no clear evidence for these effects.
   The 1 N HNO3 leach of the Bf-BC and C mineral soils, which are often
   used to identify minerals that may be releasing Mg and other base
   cations to plant-available pools, have the same average delta Mg-26
   value (-0.66 parts per thousand, n = 2) as the litter layer and
   exchangeable leach of the forest floor, all soil solutions, and the
   stream (-0.63 +/- 0.17 parts per thousand 2 sigma, n = 23). More
   revealing is the molar Mg/Ca ratio of the 1 N HNO3 treatment (0.17),
   which is nearly identical to the bulk Mg/Ca ratio of the aboveground
   biomass (0.14). We conclude that the 1 N HNO3 leach in this setting
   releases Mg from secondary minerals, such as vermiculite, other clays,
   and amorphous phases, which have taken up plant-recycled Mg and Ca that
   has filtered down through the soil from the litter layer of the forest
   floor. A single mineral, chlorite, with an estimated delta Mg-26 value
   of -0.78\%e, appears to be responsible for supplying most of the Mg that
   is circulating between the forest and soils in this setting, which is
   weathered and cached over timescales of thousands of years. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has enhanced soil carbon (C) stocks
   in temperate forests. Most research has posited that these soil C gains
   are driven primarily by shifts in fungal community composition with
   elevated N leading to declines in lignin degrading Basidiomycetes.
   Recent research, however, suggests that plants and soil microbes are
   dynamically intertwined, whereby plants send C subsidies to rhizosphere
   microbes to enhance enzyme production and the mobilization of N. Thus,
   under elevated N, trees may reduce belowground C allocation leading to
   cascading impacts on the ability of microbes to degrade soil organic
   matter through a shift in microbial species and/or a change in
   plant-microbe interactions. The objective of this study was to determine
   the extent to which couplings among plant, fungal, and bacterial
   responses to N fertilization alter the activity of enzymes that are the
   primary agents of soil decomposition. We measured fungal and bacterial
   community composition, root-microbial interactions, and extracellular
   enzyme activity in the rhizosphere, bulk, and organic horizon of soils
   sampled from a long-term (> 25 years), whole-watershed, N fertilization
   experiment at the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA. We
   observed significant declines in plant C investment to fine root biomass
   (24.7\%), root morphology, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization
   (55.9\%). Moreover, we found that declines in extracellular enzyme
   activity were significantly correlated with a shift in bacterial
   community composition, but not fungal community composition. This
   bacterial community shift was also correlated with reduced AM fungal
   colonization indicating that declines in plant investment belowground
   drive the response of bacterial community structure and function to N
   fertilization. Collectively, we find that enzyme activity responses to N
   fertilization are not solely driven by fungi, but instead reflect a
   whole ecosystem response, whereby declines in the strength of
   belowground C investment to gain N cascade through the soil environment.}},

Abstract = {{Myxomycetes are one of the major microbial predator groups found in
   detrital food webs within terrestrial ecosystems. They are typical
   inhabitants of coarse woody debris (CWD). However, the association
   between fungal communities and the foraging habits of myxomycetes has
   not been explored sufficiently in the field. Our study aimed to find
   community relationships between myxomycetes and fungi, a potential prey,
   on CWD, and the trophic status of saproxylic myxomycetes using stable
   isotope analysis of their sporocarps. Records of sporocarps present on
   184 Pinus densifiora logs during a 3-year period listed 37 species of
   myxomycetes and 45 species of fungi. Ordination analysis using
   occurrence data of 34 dominant species (17 myxomycetes and 17 fungi)
   revealed their dynamic succession during log decay. Fungal dominants
   were clearly divided into two groups-earlier and later- and the majority
   of myxomycetes occurred during the middle stages of log decay between
   the first and second groups of fungal dominants. Species level
   associations between fungal and myxomycetes communities were rare.
   Isotopic nitrogen (delta N-15) values of myxomycetes were significantly
   higher than those of wood-decay fungi, but few myxomycetes showed delta
   N-15 values higher than those of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Isotopic carbon
   (delta C-13) values of myxomycetes were not significantly different from
   those of fungi. delta N-15 values of myxomycetes and fungi and delta
   C-15 of myxomycetes significantly increased with an increase in wood
   decay. However, these positive correlations between stable isotope
   profiles and wood decay disappeared after the values were calibrated by
   subtracting the delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of sapwood from those
   of myxomycetes and fungi. While saproxylic myxomycetes have long been
   assumed to be bacterivous, the results of this study suggest that
   wood-decay fungi could be an important part of their diet, and their
   foraging associations might be non species specific.}},

Abstract = {{Intensified anthropogenic activities will increase rates of nitrogen (N)
   deposition over the next decades, especially in the tropics. There are
   urgent needs to know how soil microbial community in N-rich tropical
   forests responds to long-term N deposition. This study examined effects
   of long-term N additions on soil microbial biomass (determined by
   chloroform fumigation), microbial community composition (based on
   phospholipid fatty acids, PLFAs), and microbial enzyme activities, using
   an ongoing experimental N additions field in an N rich tropical forest
   of South China. There were four N additions levels: no additions
   (Control); 50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (Low-N); 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)
   (Medium-N), and 150 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (High-N). Results showed that
   long-term N additions significantly decreased microbial biomass carbon
   (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), but had little effects on total PLFAs.
   However, elevated N inputs significantly reduced the relative abundance
   of bacterial PLFAs, especially gram-negative bacterial PLFAs with higher
   gram-positive bacteria: gram-negative bacteria ratio in N treatment
   plots. Although N additions did not change fungi: bacteria ratio, the
   proportion of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased significantly with
   N additions. Long-term N additions greatly increased bacterial stress
   indexes and enhanced specific enzyme activity (activity per unit of
   microbial biomass) involved in carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus
   mineralization. Meanwhile, shifts in microbial community composition and
   specific enzyme activity were correlated well with soil pH and available
   N. These results suggest that N-mediated environmental stresses can play
   an important role in shaping microbial community, and that soil microbes
   will invest more resources on enzyme production in N-rich forest under
   elevated N deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient cycling is greatly influenced by dominant plants that
   contribute high amounts of leaf litter to soils; however, less-dominant
   and rare species can play keystone roles in nutrient cycling if they
   have unique nutrient acquisition traits and provide high-quality litter.
   In many parts of the world, wildfire is likely to become more frequent
   and intense under a changing climate. The effect this will have on plant
   rarity and on species with unique nutrient acquisition traits, and thus
   nutrient cycling, remains poorly understood. Working within an
   Australian box-ironbark forest, we determined if a relationship existed
   between species rarity and the uniqueness of their leaf nutrient
   profiles, and if this relationship changed after prescribed burning. We
   created an index of species rarity from a data set of woody perennial
   species abundance in areas before and after autumn or spring burns, or
   left unburnt. We created indices of uniqueness for the leaf nutrient
   profiles of 42 woody perennial species occurring in the ecosystem, based
   on amounts of six macronutrients and four micronutrients found in fresh
   and senesced leaves of each species. Five nutrient acquisition
   strategies (mycorrhizal, N-fixing, carnivorous, hemiparasitic and
   proteoid roots) were represented in the data set. There was no
   community-wide relationship between rarity and uniqueness of leaf
   nutrient profiles, and this did not change as a result of fire. However,
   two hemiparasitic species were relatively rare in the ecosystem studied,
   and differed greatly from other species due to high K and P in senesced
   leaves. Thus, some of the rarest species, such as hemiparasites, can be
   functionally unique. Understanding the functional characteristics of
   rare species is important so that unique functional contributors can be
   identified and conserved to prevent local extinction.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{Plant-microbial interactions in the litter layer represent one of the
   most relevant interactions for biogeochemical cycling as litter
   decomposition is a key first step in carbon and nitrogen turnover.
   However, our understanding of these interactions in the litter layer
   remains elusive. In an old-growth mixed Nothofagus forest in Patagonia,
   we studied the effects of single tree species identity and themixture of
   three tree species on the fungal and bacterial composition in the litter
   layer. We also evaluated the effects of nitrogen (N) addition on these
   plant-microbial interactions. In addition, we compared themagnitude of
   stimulation of litter decomposition due to home field advantage (HFA,
   decomposition occurs more rapidly when litter is placed beneath the
   plant species from which it had been derived than beneath a different
   plant species) and Naddition that we previously demonstrated in this
   same forest, and usedmicrobial information to interpret these results.
   Tree species identity had a strong and significant effect on the
   composition of fungal communities but not on the bacterial community of
   the litter layer. The microbial composition of the litter layer under
   the tree species mixture show an averaged contribution of each single
   tree species. N addition did not erase the plant species footprint on
   the fungal community, and neither altered the bacterial community. N
   addition stimulated litter decomposition asmuch as HFA for certain tree
   species, but themechanisms behind N and HFA stimulation may have
   differed. Our results suggest that stimulation of decomposition from N
   addition might have occurred due to increased microbial activity without
   large changes in microbial community composition, while HFA may have
   resulted principally from plant species' effects on the litter fungal
   community. Together, our results suggest that plant-microbial
   interactions can be an unconsidered driver of litter decomposition in
   temperate forests.}},

   the seedlings of both species grew in the seedling pots within the main
   container but separated from the soil matrix by nylon membranes that

   but did result in higher seedling nutrient content. Adult plant identity
   affected the nutrient content for the Maianthemum seedlings. Adult plant
   identity did not directly affect the Arisaema seedlings, but connection
   with the CMN of a heterospecific adult improved leaf N content more than
   connection with the CMN of a conspecific adult. Water stress also
   impacted the seedlings differentlywater-stressed Arisaema seedlings had
   less seedling biomass, while water-stressed Maianthemum seedlings, for
   example, had higher nutrient content compared with well-watered plants.
   The Maianthemum seedlings also exhibited the highest gas exchange rates

Abstract = {{investigated how properties of soil organic matter (SOM) were altered

   ({[}CO2]) in a Mojave Desert ecosystem, using plant and microbial
   biomarkers. We focused on roles of Larrea tridentata, the dominant
   evergreen shrub which form islands of fertility, and biological soil
   crusts which have extensive cover in plant interspace. Soils to 5 cm in
   depth were collected under L. tridentata and plant interspace, and
   biological soil crusts to 0.5 cm in depth under three cover types,
   Pleuraphis rigida, a C-4 grass, shrubs and plant interspace. Soil
   organic carbon contents were not significantly different between
   elevated and ambient {[}CO2]. However, significantly higher abundance of
   n-alkanes, a major constituent of foliage wax material, occurred in the
   elevated compared to ambient {[}CO2] plots in the soils collected under
   L. tridentata, but no such difference was found in the soils at plant
   interspace or the biological soil crusts. There was no significant
   difference in abundance of microbial phospholipid fatty acids between
   the CO2 treatments in the soils of either cover types. However, neutral
   lipid fatty acid abundance was significantly higher under elevated than
   ambient {[}CO2] in the soils under L. tridentata, whereas no such
   significant difference was observed at plant interspace. These results
   emphasize important roles of the dominant shrubs in SOM formation under
   elevated {[}CO2] in arid ecosystems. Elevated {[}CO2] stimulated growth
   of L. tridentata in wet years, and aboveground litter deposition via

Abstract = {{Despite the general appreciation that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)
   can influence decomposition of organic materials, the underlying
   mechanisms remain unclear. Here we investigated whether AMF influence
   decomposition and change the associated soil bacterial and fungal
   communities through nutrient acquisition and whether this effect is
   altered by the level of soil phosphorus (P). We conducted a pot
   experiment using Medicago truncatula as host plant without or with AMF
   (a mixture of six species) and with two levels of soil P (4 and 24 mg
   kg(-1)). Hyphal-ingrowth mesh bags (which excluded roots but not hyphae
   or other microbes) were used to measure the effect of AMF hyphae on
   decomposition. Maize leaves dual-labeled with N-15:C-13 stable isotopes
   were used as the organic substrate. Bacterial and fungal communities
   were accessed via sequencing of partial 16S rRNA and ITS genes. The
   results showed the N-15 and C-13 content of the organic matter remaining
   in the mesh bags under low soil P availability were significantly lower
   in the treatment with AMF than without AMF. Under high soil P
   availability, however, no significant difference of N-15 content
   remaining was found between AMF and non-AMF treatments, while C-13
   content remaining was higher in AMF than in non-AMF treatment. Levels of
   mycorrhizal colonization and (1) N-5 transport from organic matter to
   the host by AMF hyphae were higher at low P availability than at high P
   availability, suggesting that the host can acquire more nutrients
   through the AM from organic matter when soil P availability was low. The
   composition of bacterial and fungal communities were altered by AMF at
   both soil P levels. For bacterial community, the richness and diversity
   were higher with low P availability, especially for the phyla
   Saccharibacteria and Nitrospirae. For fungal community, AMF increased
   the richness but not the diversity under low P availability. Together,
   we show that AMF acquire nutrients from organic matter for host,
   influence decomposition and alter the bacterial and fungal communities,
   and that these effects were modulated by the soil P availability.}},

   compare the physical and chemical properties of soils under GDF with

   topography. To this end, we set up sixteen 0.25-ha plots according to
   forest type and topography (plateau vs. bottomland), in the Yoko forest
   reserve, Democratic Republic of Congo. In each plot, we measured litter
   thickness and collected a total of 80 soil samples at depths of 0-5,
   5-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 120-150 cm, for standard physical and chemical
   analyses. When controlling for topography and soil texture, we found
   that most of the chemical properties of soils under GDF did not differ
   from those of soils under AMF, particularly acidity, cation
   concentration, total N and the C:N ratio. The litter layer was 2.3 times
   thicker under GDF than under AMF stands, and, for a given texture, soils
   under GDF had a slightly higher organic C concentration in the 0-5 cm

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{858-869}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Plant roots and the associated mycorrhizal fungal hyphae often
   selectively proliferate into patchily distributed soil nutrient
   hotspots, but interactions between these two components of a mycorrhizal
   root system are usually ignored or experimentally isolated in nutrient
   foraging studies.
   2. From studies in which both roots and mycorrhizal hyphae had access to
   nutrient hotspots, we compiled data on root foraging precision (increase
   in roots in nutrient hotspots relative to outside hotspots) of plant
   species from different ecosystems, ranging from temperate grasslands to
   subtropical forests. We found that root foraging precision across the
   wide range of plant species was strongly influenced by root morphology
   and mycorrhizal type.
   3. The precision of root nutrient foraging, as a plant functional trait,
   may coordinate with other root traits that are related to the economics
   of nutrient acquisition. High foraging precision is expected to
   associate with the strategy of fast return on the investment in roots,
   such as low construction cost, high metabolic rate and rapid turnover.
   4. Nutrient foraging by mycorrhizal fungi alone may be influenced by
   functional traits such as hyphal exploration distance, hyphal turnover,
   and hyphal uptake capacity and efficiency, but such data are limited to
   a small portion of mycorrhizal fungal species.
   5. We propose a conceptual framework in which to simulate nitrogen and
   phosphorus acquisition from both nutrient hotspots and outside hotspots
   in mixed-species plant communities. Simulation outputs suggest that
   plant species with varying root morphology and mycorrhizal type can be
   adaptive to a range of nutrient heterogeneity.
   6. Although there are still knowledge gaps related to nutrient foraging,
   as well as many unexplored plant and fungal species, we suggest that
   scaling nutrient foraging from individual plants to communities would
   advance understanding of plant species interactions and below-ground
   ecosystem function.}},

Abstract = {{Though typically discussed in the context of salinity, a shortage of

   fungal responses to sodium availability. Despite careful experimentation
   and the usage of different fungal strains we did not find evidence for
   fungal sodium demands using controlled nutrient media, not even in the
   absence of potassium. Likewise, there was no significant fungal response
   to sodium additions in litter samples, though decomposition rates were
   positively affected. These findings suggest that sodium is not essential

   Multivariate analyses were used to test community patterns between
   hydnoids and vegetation, divided into layers and plant functional
   groups. We confirmed the hypothesis that vegetation layers and
   functional groups have different effects on the individual hydnoid
   species. The occurrence of hydnoids is conditional especially on the
   dominant tree species. The main vegetation gradient of hydnoid sites is
   represented by the proportion of deciduous versus coniferous trees.
   Smaller trees in shrub and herb layers do not play a significant role
   except for spruce. Some hydnoids occur at sites with a species-rich herb
   layer, whereas others occur at sites with ericoid heaths and lichens,
   wet sites covered with hygrophilous mosses, or bare soils only covered
   by litter. Possible factors favouring hydnoids and causing their

Abstract = {{Litter decomposition is a crucial biogeochemical process linking
   nutrient cycling and carbon (C) storage in ecosystems, but few studies
   have investigated this process in agroforestry systems, where tree leaf
   litter is mixed with intercrop residues.
   A 360-day in situ litter bag decomposition experiment was conducted in
   three ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) plantation systems (a ginkgo-corn (Zea
   mays L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) system, ginkgo-rape (Brassica
   napus L.)-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) system, and pure ginkgo
   system).
   Ginkgo leaves decomposed fastest in the ginkgo-corn-wheat system,
   followed by the ginkgo-soybean-rape system, and the pure ginkgo system.
   Among all litter species, corn leaves and a ginkgo-corn mixture in the
   ginkgo-corn-wheat system decomposed fastest and wheat straw most slowly.
   The Olson's litter exponential decay model showed the same results;
   approximately 9 months and slightly less than 27 months was required to
   decompose 50 and 95\% of the litter, respectively. Compared to
   single-species litter, mixed litters accelerated litter decomposition,
   except for the ginkgo-wheat mixture. Litter nitrogen (N) loss varied
   dramatically among litter species during the 360-day in situ incubation.
   The agroforestry system, litter quality, and mixed effects play
   important roles in litter decomposition. The Ca content, organic carbon,
   and living vegetation should be taken into account when studying litter
   decomposition in agroforestry. Analysis during the litter decomposition
   process clearly indicated that litter N loss changes dramatically.}},

Abstract = {{While it is increasingly recognized that ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and
   arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree species vary in their effects on soil
   nitrogen (N) cycling, little is known about the mechanisms causing and
   how ECM and AM trees adapt to this variation. Using monoculture plots of
   six ECM and eight AM tropical trees planted in a common garden, we
   examined whether the contrasting effects of ECM and AM trees on soil N
   cycling could be explained by their differences in plant traits.
   Furthermore, rhizosphere effects on soil N transformations and soil
   exploration by fine roots were also measured to assess whether ECM and
   AM trees differed in N acquisition capacities. Results showed that soil
   NH4+-N concentration, net N mineralization and net nitrification rates
   were markedly lower, but soil C:N ratio was significantly higher beneath
   ECM trees than beneath AM trees. This more closed N cycling caused by
   ECM trees was attributed to their resource-conservative traits,
   especially the poorer leaf litter decomposability compared with AM
   trees. To adapt to their induced lower soil N availability, ECM trees
   were found to have greater rhizosphere effects on NO3--N concentration,
   net N mineralization and net nitrification rates to mine N, and higher
   soil exploration in terms of root length density to scavenge N from
   soils, indicating that these two strategies work in synergy to meet N
   demand of ECM trees. These findings suggest that ECM and AM trees have
   contrasting effects on soil N cycling owing to their differences in leaf
   litter decomposability and correspondingly possess different N
   acquisition capacities.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition rates are
   predicted to drastically increase in the coming decades. The ecosystem
   level consequences of these increases will depend on how plant tissue
   nutrient concentrations, stoichiometry and investment in nutrient uptake
   mechanisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) change in response
   to increased nutrient availability, and how responses differ between
   plant functional types. Using a factorial nutrient addition experiment
   with seedlings of multiple N-fixing and non-N-fixing tree species, we
   examined whether leaf chemistry and AMF responses differ between these
   dominant woody plant functional groups of tropical savanna and dry
   forest ecosystems. We found that N-fixers have remarkably stable foliar
   chemistry that stays constant with external input of nutrients.
   Non-N-fixers responded to N and N + P addition by increasing both
   concentrations and total amounts of foliar N, but showed a corresponding
   decrease in P concentrations while total amounts of foliar P stayed
   constant, suggesting a `dilution' of tissue P with increased N
   availability. Non-N-fixers also showed an increase in N:P ratios with N
   and N + P addition, probably driven by both an increase in N and a
   decrease in P concentrations. AMF colonization decreased with N + P
   addition in non-N-fixers and increased with N and N + P addition in
   N-fixers, suggesting differences in their nutrient acquisition roles in
   the two plant functional groups. Our results suggest that N-fixers and

Abstract = {{Understanding the factors that structure soil microbial communities and
   their relative importance in determining local community assemblages is
   fundamental to understanding how human activities, such as forest
   management, may impact soil ecosystems. We studied fungal communities in
   soil and litter under multiple sites dominated by spruce, beech and oak
   in a central European forest ecosystem to further understand the
   relative importance of vegetation and abiotic variables within a
   temperate forest. We sampled four times over a one-year period to
   determine if fungal community composition varied over time and whether
   the determination of driving factors was temporally dependent. We found
   that fungal community composition differed between litter and soil and
   among stand types but that community structure (richness,
   functional-guilds) was similar. In litter communities, composition was
   strongly coupled to dominant tree species; while in soil communities,
   both dominant tree and abiotic variables such as pH were important- with
   each variable explaining a separable portion of the variation in the
   fungal community composition. Further analyses showed that the relative
   importance of dominant tree species and abiotic drivers differed among
   functional groups subsets of the community. Across our sampled sites,
   both the litter and soil communities of a given stand type were
   well-characterized by a set of low abundance indicator species with
   consistent presence, regardless of location, suggesting stand type is an
   important local filter on the occurrence of these taxa within the
   spatial context of our study (100 km(2)). The marked difference in
   annual leaf break and leaf fall between coniferous and deciduous stands
   were not found to correlate with temporal changes in fungal community
   composition; however, a time-dependent trend was found across all soil
   communities and among all soil functional-group subsets regardless of

Abstract = {{Seedlings near a conspecific adult might suffer increased mortality due
   to pressure from enemies such as below-ground pathogenic fungi
   (Janzen-Connell hypothesis), however, variation exists among taxa such
   that some experience low levels of mortality. We hypothesized that
   seedlings close to adults might profit, rather than suffer, from
   below-ground fungi, notably from mycorrhiza or decomposers, in
   particular near large adult trees and under a closely related canopy. We
   planted oak seedlings in a temperate forest at different distances from
   adults and followed seedling mortality, budburst (early budburst
   permitting photosynthesis during the best light conditions) and leaf
   herbivory. We applied fungicide on half of the seedlings for 2years to
   identify the net effect of below-ground fungi on seedlings. We
   quantified seedling mycorrhization and fungal-driven decomposition of a
   neighbourhood-specific and an unspecific substrate, local oak leaves and
   cellulose respectively. Finally, we related mycorrhization and
   decomposition to seedling performance. We found that, in seedlings
   planted close to conspecific adults, below-ground fungi had a negative
   net effect on seedlings: elimination of fungi, surprisingly, decreased
   herbivory. This effect could be due to oak leaf decomposition, which was
   related to increased seedling herbivory and was higher near a
   conspecific adult. Under a closely related canopy, however, the net
   effect of below-ground fungi on nearby seedlings became positive:
   elimination of fungi delayed budburst. This effect could be due to
   colonization by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Cortinarius sp., which
   related to accelerated budburst and was higher near a conspecific under
   a closely related canopy. Effects of below-ground fungi on nearby
   seedlings were not dependent on the size of the conspecific and were
   species but not lineage specific. Overall, our results suggest that a
   Janzen-Connell-like pattern, that is, increased mortality of seedlings
   near conspecific adult, can be (1) induced by specialist decomposers
   increasing the nutritional quality of conspecific seedlings to
   herbivores, and (2) offset by ectomycorrhizal fungal mutualists under a
   closely related canopy. Coexistence among closely related adult trees
   appears to change interactions between adults and nearby conspecific
   seedlings from conspecific inhibition to conspecific facilitation.}},

Abstract = {{Forest management practices often severely affect forest ecosystem
   functioning. Tree removal by clearcutting is one such practice,
   producing severe impacts due to the total reduction of primary
   productivity. Here, we assessed changes to fungal community structure
   and decomposition activity in the soil, roots and rhizosphere of a Picea
   abies stand for a 2-year period following clearcutting compared to data
   from before tree harvest. We found that the termination of photosynthate
   flow through tree roots into soil is associated with profound changes in
   soil, both in decomposition processes and fungal community composition.
   The rhizosphere, representing an active compartment of high enzyme
   activity and high fungal biomass in the living stand, ceases to exist
   and starts to resemble bulk soil. Decomposing roots appear to separate
   from bulk soil and develop into hotspots of decomposition and important
   fungal biomass pools. We found no support for the involvement of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi in the decomposition of roots, but we found some
   evidence that root endophytic fungi may have an important role in the
   early stages of this process. In soil, activity of extracellular enzymes
   also decreased in the long term following the end of rhizodeposition by
   tree roots.}},

Abstract = {{1. Fungi play critical roles in ecosystem processes such as
   decomposition and nutrient cycling, but have also been highlighted as
   significant contributors to organic matter build-up in boreal forest
   soils. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) mycelial biomass and necromass dynamics
   have recently been highlighted as essential for regulating build-up of
   soil organic matter. Understanding the extent to which shifts in
   mycelial community or growth trait composition cause changes in mycelial
   production and turnover over ecological gradients would aid a
   mechanistic understanding of these important processes at an ecosystem
   scale.
   2. Here, we test the hypotheses that shifting species and mycelial trait
   (exploration type) composition within the mycelial community underpin
   changes in biomass turnover with increasing forest age. We quantified
   mycelial turnover and assessed fungal community composition in a
   chronosequence of eight, 12- to 158-year-old, managed Pinus sylvestris
   forests. Turnover was estimated by determining mycelial biomass
   (ergosterol) in a sequence of ingrowth mesh bags and applying
   mathematical models. Fungal communities in the bags were identified
   using Pacific Biosciences sequencing of fungal ITS2 amplicons. To
   evaluate the accuracy of this method to represent all ECM fungi,
   community composition in bags was followed over time and compared with
   communities in soil.
   3. Mycelial communities changed with stand age, but we found no evidence
   that there were concurrent shifts in mycelial exploration types. Forest
   age and turnover were significantly correlated with ECM mycelial
   community composition and collectively explained 39.4\% of total
   variation. The similarity between fungal communities in mesh bags and in
   soil was strongly forest age dependent, with communities in mesh bags
   diverging from soil communities in stands older than 60 years. However,
   in all stands, when bag incubation time exceeded 75 days, communities
   became more similar to soil communities.
   4. Synthesis. Our results support the idea that shifts in fungal
   community composition underpin the forest age-related decrease in
   mycelial turnover; however, since ingrowth mesh bags exclude some
   mycorrhizal species in older forests, it remains a possibility that
   turnover estimates were not reflecting the entire community. While we
   found no evidence that mycelial exploration types of fungi changed
   systematically with forest age, we suggest that other traits that relate
   to biomass turnover and necromass degradation require further study, as
   they may explain the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi regulate and
   contribute to soil organic matter accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{1. Root-derived inputs are increasingly viewed as primary controls of
   soil organic matter (SOM) formation; however, we have a limited
   understanding of how root decay rates depend on soil factors, and how
   decaying roots influence the breakdown of leaf litter and SOM.
   2. We incubated root and leaf litter (alone and in combination) from
   arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees in soils
   collected from forest plots dominated by AM and ECM trees in a factorial
   design. In each microcosm, we quantified litter decay rates and the
   effects of decaying litters on soil C balance. We hypothesized that (1)
   AM root litters would decompose faster than ECM root litters, (2) root
   litter decay would be greatest when decomposed in ``home{''} soils (e.g.
   AM litters in AM soils and ECM litters in ECM soils) and (3) root and
   leaf litters would decompose faster when decaying in the same microcosms
   than when decaying in separate microcosms, resulting in the largest CO2
   losses.
   3. Overall, AM root litter decomposed faster than ECM root litter, and
   the magnitude of this effect depended on soil origin. AM litters decayed
   fastest in AM soils, but ECM and mixed AM-ECM litters were unaffected by
   soil origin. Decaying roots increased leaf litter mass loss, but only in
   microcosms containing soils of the same origin (e.g. AM litters in AM
   soils; mixed litters in mixed soils).
   4. Carbon losses were dominated by microbial respiration, and the
   magnitude of this flux depended on litter type and soil origin. When
   leaves and roots decayed together, respiratory losses exceeded those
   from microcosms containing leaves and roots alone, with the largest
   losses occurring in each litters' ``home{''} soil. In AM soils, elevated
   losses were driven by roots accelerating leaf decay, while in ECM soils,
   elevated losses resulted from roots and leaves accelerating the decay of
   SOM; in mixed soils, root-induced increases in leaf and SOM decay
   contributed to elevated C losses.
   5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that root, leaf and SOM decay are
   intertwined, and that measurements of these processes in isolation may
   lead to incorrect estimates of the magnitude and source of C losses from
   soils.}},

Abstract = {{Functional differences between trees with arbuscular (AM) or
   ectomycorrhizal (ECM) partnerships influence important ecological
   processes including nutrient cycling, community assembly, and biomass
   allocation patterns. Although most broadleaf temperate forests show both
   mycorrhizal types, relatively few studies have addressed functional
   difference among coexisting mycorrhizal tree species. The maintenance of
   ECM associations usually requires higher C investment than AM, leading
   to (A) lower root biomass and (B) more conservative root trait syndromes
   in ECM tree species compared to AM species. Here we quantified the
   representation and trait syndromes of 14 canopy tree species associated
   with either AM or ECM fungi in a natural forest community. Our results
   showed that, whereas species root abundance was proportional to basal
   area, some ECM tree roots were largely under-represented (up to similar
   to 33\%). Most of the under-representation was due to lower than
   expected root abundance of Quercus rubra and Fagus grandifolia.
   Functional root traits in tree species were similar, with the exception
   of higher tissue density in ECM species. Moreover, closely related AM
   and ECM exhibited similar traits, suggesting inherited trait syndrome
   from a common ancestor. Thus, we found little evidence of divergent
   functional root trait syndromes between mycorrhizal types. Cores
   dominated by ECM species influenced trait distribution at the community
   level, but not total biomass, suggesting that mycorrhizal affiliation
   may have a stronger effect on the spatial distribution of traits but not
   on biomass stocks. Our results present an important step toward relating
   belowground carbon dynamics to species traits, including mycorrhizal
   type, in broadleaf temperate forests.}},

   was an increase in AMF root colonization of E. grandis when intercropped

   colonization and phosphatase activities were both involved in
   improvements in P cycling and P nutrition in soil. In addition, P
   cycling was favored in the intercropped plantation, which showed

Abstract = {{Due to the standing biomass and turnover of fungal biomass in forest
   topsoils, decomposition of fungal biomass represents an important
   process. Within plant litter, dead fungal biomass represents a unique
   substrate that is typically nitrogen (N)-rich and is assumed to be
   subject to rapid decomposition. However, our current knowledge of
   mycelial decomposition has been largely derived from short-term studies,
   often limited to a single mycelia type, and the guilds of microbial
   mycelium decomposers have not yet been described. Furthermore, nutrient
   content may vary largely in fungal mycelia, and the consequences of this
   variation are unknown. Here, we followed the decomposition of dead
   biomass of 12 ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic fungi of a
   temperate forest using mycobags incubated in litter for 3 and 9 weeks.
   Loss of substrate dry mass, microbial biomass content and community
   composition as well as the activity of extracellular enzymes reflecting
   microbial activity on this substrate were followed. Decomposition rates
   of fungal biomass were typically high (0.13-0.30 week(-1)), yet
   variable. The decomposition includes a rapid initial phase followed by a
   slower turnover of remaining biomass. The initial nitrogen content that
   ranged between 1.5\% and 10\% appeared to be the most important factor
   that affected colonization of dead mycelia and their decomposition. The
   relatively high content of N makes fungal mycelia an attractive resource
   in the N-poor habitat of plant litter. Decomposition of mycelia was
   performed by a guild of specialist decomposers that showed rather low
   abundance in surrounding litter and changed during decomposition.
   Bacteria were much more abundant on dead fungal biomass than in the
   surrounding litter and appeared to play an important role in
   decomposition. Fungi associated with dead mycelia were mainly
   represented by yeasts and moulds. Although the importance of fungal
   mycelia for the nutrient cycling in forests is not yet clear, the fact
   that they are turned over rapidly suggests that they may represent an
   important and dynamic pool of carbon and nitrogen.}},

   monthly over three years, together with climatic variables like humidity
   and temperature that influence fungal diversity and composition as shown
   by previous studies. In this mosaic landscape, a total of 855 fungal
   species were collected and identified based on morphological features,
   the majority of which belonged to Ascomycota (51 \%) and Basidiomycota
   (45 \%). Records of fungal species and plant species (218) for this area
   yielded a fungus to plant species ratio of 4:1, with a plant species
   accumulation curve that reached saturation. The three years of
   monitoring, however, were not sufficient to reveal the total fungal
   species richness and estimation factors showed that a fungus to plant
   species ratio of 6:1 may be reached by further sampling efforts. The
   effect of climatic conditions on fungal species richness differed
   depending on the taxonomic and ecological group, with temporal patterns
   of occurrence of Basidiomycota and mycorrhizal fungi being strongly
   associated with temperature and humidity, whereas the other fungal
   groups were only weakly related to abiotic conditions. In conclusion,
   long-term, monthly surveys over several years yield a higher diversity

Abstract = {{Edible forest mushrooms are one of the most important non-wood products
   and their economic importance is constantly growing. Only in Poland, the
   value of collected mushroom is estimated to about 740 million PLN a
   year. Such species as Boletus sp., Lactarius sp. or Tuber sp. are the
   most valuable non-wood forest products. Wild species, a great part of
   which are ectomycorrhizal fungi, not only play a key role in the growth
   and development of forest trees, but also belong to the most used in the
   Polish cuisine. A new challenge is to develop a scientific basis for the
   production of edible ectomycorrhizal fungi. Given the fact that
   fructification of fungi is influenced by many environmental, ecological,
   orographic and anthropogenic factors, their growing is rather a tough
   task. So far, methods of fungi growing have been developed in case of
   several species and they are still to be implemented on an economic
   scale. Under natural conditions, both mycorrhizal and fruiting processes
   may be stimulated by proper silviculture treatments, which are conducive
   to wood and mushrooms production as well. Nowadays, the concept of
   `mycosilviculture' is gaining more and more interest. In order to
   implement it, the knowledge of the biology of fungi and their
   host-species is needed. In this article, a rich body of studies dealing
   with the influence of management methods on fruitification of fungi is
   reviewed. The critical factor that appears is the proper regulation of
   tree density by appropriate severity of thinnings and regeneration cuts
   in order to meet the requirements of targeted fungi. The other kinds of
   treatments, such as removal of the herb cover, litter and upper soil
   level also affect fungi fructification. The effect of these treatments
   may vary for different species. The knowledge of wild mushroom
   production, forest management and climate changes still requires
   long-term and multidimensional research in a broad spectrum of tree

Abstract = {{1. Mycorrhizal fungi are known for their functional importance in plant
   growth and nutrition, and because these symbiotic fungi represent a
   fundamental linkage between plants and soils, they likely underpin a
   number of biogeochemical processes in ecosystems. However, our ability
   to isolate and quantify their role in ecosystems has remained a
   challenge.
   2. This special feature presents seven new studies that advance our
   understanding of how mycorrhizal fungi contribute to ecosystem function.
   We specifically highlight two complementary approaches by which
   ecologists are gaining insight: focusing on mycorrhizal fungal traits to
   target the biological mechanisms that scale up to the ecosystem, and
   capturing patterns and processes across ecosystems to understand the net
   effect of complex plant-fungal-soil interactions.
   3. The studies in our special feature provide evidence that traits both
   within and across species of mycorrhizal fungi can contribute to
   ecosystem processes, and that disturbance from global change and
   management may result in altered mycorrhizal traits and lead to
   compromised ecosystem function. From a broader perspective, studies also
   demonstrate that key ecosystem properties vary over gradients of
   mycorrhizal dominance and time, suggesting that mycorrhizal effects
   emerge from complex interactions within ecosystems
   4. Synthesis. Employing complementary approaches to the study of
   mycorrhizal ecology may allow us to isolate the mycorrhizal traits that
   matter most for ecosystem properties, as well as the suite of ecosystem
   properties that result from mycorrhizal fungi, thus converging on
   biogeochemical mechanisms that underpin terrestrial ecosystem function.}},

Abstract = {{1. Mycorrhizal fungal necromass is increasingly recognized as an
   important contributor to soil organic carbon pools, particularly in
   forest ecosystems. While its decomposition rate is primarily determined
   by biochemical composition, how traits such as melanin content affect
   the structure of necromass decomposer communities remains poorly
   understood.
   2. To assess the role of biochemical traits on microbial decomposer
   community composition and functioning, we incubated melanized and
   non-melanized necromass of the mycorrhizal fungus Meliniomyces bicolor
   in Pinus-and Quercus-dominated forests in Minnesota, USA and then
   assessed the associated fungal and bacterial decomposer communities
   after 1, 2 and 3 months using high-throughput sequencing.
   3. Melanized necromass decomposed significantly slower than
   non-melanized necromass in both forests. The structure of the microbial
   decomposer communities depended significantly on necromass melanin
   content, although the effect was stronger for fungi than bacteria. On
   non-melanized necromass, fungal communities were dominated by r-selected
   ascomycete and mucoromycete microfungi early and then replaced by
   basidiomycete ectomycorrhizal fungi, while on melanized necromass these
   groups were co-dominant throughout the incubation. Bacterial communities
   were dominated by both specialist mycophageous and generalist taxa.
   4. Synthesis. Our results indicate that necromass biochemistry not only
   strongly affects rates of decomposition but also the structure of the
   associated decomposer communities. Furthermore, the observed
   colonization patterns suggest that fungi, and particularly
   ectomycorrhizal fungi, may play a more important role in necromass

Title = {{Association of ectomycorrhizal trees with high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio
   soils across temperate forests is driven by smaller nitrogen not larger
   carbon stocks}},

Abstract = {{1. The distribution of mycorrhizal associations across biomes parallels
   a distinct gradient of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks, raising
   the question of how mycorrhizal traits relate to ecosystem properties.
   Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) hosts and fungi
   employ contrasting strategies for N acquisition, which may manifest in
   differences in soil C and N pools and/or soil C: N. However, cross-biome
   comparisons are confounded with climatic and edaphic gradients as well
   as phylogenetic and functional trait distributions of component plant
   species. Here, we test emerging hypotheses that soil C, N and C: N are
   related to the dominance of EM trees within a temperate forest region
   where AM and EM trees largely coexist but vary in local abundance.
   2. To determine the importance of mycorrhizal type on soil C and N, we
   analysed data from c. 1,000 forest inventory plots in the eastern United
   States. For each plot, we quantified the dominance of trees with
   different mycorrhizal associations and accounted for potentially
   confounding variables including phylogeny (angiosperm or gymnosperm),
   leaf N, soil clay content and climate. We used hierarchical Bayesian
   models to determine how these variables explained the patterns of soil C
   and N in the forest floor and mineral soil layers.
   3. Increasing EM dominance was associated with higher C: N across all
   soil layers. This relationship remained even after accounting for tree
   phylogeny, leaf N content, soil clay content, temperature and
   precipitation, which were all important for explaining soil C: N.
   However, this mycorrhizal pattern of soil C: N was not related to
   increases in soil C content; rather, increasing EM dominance was
   associated with reductions in soil N.
   4. Synthesis. Our findings are consistent with the proposition that
   mycorrhizal associations are related to terrestrial ecosystem
   properties. The mycorrhizal effect on soil C: N may result from
   differences in how arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plants
   interact with their fungal symbionts, decomposers and organic matter, to
   sustain differential cycling of C and N. Alternatively, these patterns
   could arise from differential success of the two mycorrhizal types in
   contrasting soil conditions; both processes may occur simultaneously,
   leading to a self-reinforcing positive feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Rates of recovery of soil organic matter (SOM) in abandoned fields of
   Mediterranean Spain are affected by spontaneous succession in the
   vegetation, the occurrence of periodic wildfires and lack of forest
   management. Soil organic matter has a relevant role together with the
   renaturalization process of shallow soil under vines (V) and olive
   groves (OL), cork oak (S) and pine (P1) trees, pasture (PR), Cisttis
   (MC) and Erica (MB) scrub in abandoned areas of NE Spain that are
   sensitive to fire. Physical, chemical, biological and biochemical
   properties of the soil determined season by season warned against its
   fragility. Pyrolysis-GC products showed in general moderate to strong
   positive and negative correlation with soil organic carbon (OC), easily
   extractable glomalin (EE-GRSP) and total glomalin (GRSP), f3-glucosidase
   and protease, which strengthens the hypothesis that both less and mote
   recalcitrant SOM fractions might be inferred and so there is a scale of
   potential carbon storage in the environments studied.
   Recently abandoned V and OL soil had small OC contents (mean 2.51 +/-
   0.25 and 15.26 +/- 1.39 g kg(-1)) and GRSP (mean 1.04 +/- 0.22 and 2.84
   +/- 0.53 g kg(-1)) and large contents of aromatic compounds. By
   contrast, PR and MB soil had large OC (mean 36.24 +/- 0.75 and 37.66 +/-
   2.38 g kg(-1)) and GRSP (mean 4.85 +/- 0.87 and 3.88 +/- 0.76 g kg(-1))
   content and smaller contents of aromatic compounds. This suggested a
   renewal of active OC in older soil. In fact, EE-GRSP and GRSP of more
   organic soil were positively correlated with the mineralization indices
   N/O (Furfural/Pyrrole) and O/Y (Pyrrole/Phenol) from active organic
   compounds (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively), and negatively
   correlated (P < 0.05) with the humification index B/E3 (Benzene/Toluene)
   from recalcitrant organic compounds. Principal component analysis (PCA)
   identified those environments where soil renaturalization is better. Our
   findings might indicate the potential for carbon storage in different
   abandoned shallow soil environments under renaturalization in
   Mediterranean climate conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The symbiosis between plants and Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) is shown to
   considerably influence the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes between
   the soil, rhizosphere, and plants in boreal forest ecosystems. However,
   ECM are either neglected or presented as an implicit, undynamic term in
   most ecosystem models, which can potentially reduce the predictive power
   of models.
   In order to investigate the necessity of an explicit consideration of
   ECM in ecosystem models, we implement the previously developed MYCOFON
   model into a detailed process-based, soil-plant-atmosphere model,
   Coup-MYCOFON, which explicitly describes the C and N fluxes between ECM
   and roots. This new Coup-MYCOFON model approach (ECM explicit) is
   compared with two simpler model approaches: one containing ECM
   implicitly as a dynamic uptake of organic N considering the plant roots
   to represent the ECM (ECM implicit), and the other a static N approach
   in which plant growth is limited to a fixed N level (nonlim). Parameter
   uncertainties are quantified using Bayesian calibration in which the
   model outputs are constrained to current forest growth and soil C / N
   ratio for four forest sites along a climate and N deposition gradient in
   Sweden and simulated over a 100-year period.
   The ``nonlim{''} approach could not describe the soil C / N ratio due to
   large overestimation of soil N sequestration but simulate the forest
   growth reasonably well. The ECM ``implicit{''} and ``explicit{''}
   approaches both describe the soil C / N ratio well but slightly
   underestimate the forest growth. The implicit approach simulated lower
   litter production and soil respiration than the explicit approach. The
   ECM explicit Coup-MYCOFON model provides a more detailed description of
   internal ecosystem fluxes and feedbacks of C and N between plants, soil,
   and ECM. Our modeling highlights the need to incorporate ECM and organic
   N uptake into ecosystem models, and the nonlim approach is not
   recommended for future long-term soil C and N predictions. We also
   provide a key set of posterior fungal parameters that can be further
   investigated and evaluated in future ECM studies.}},

Title = {{Limited Effects of Variable-Retention Harvesting on Fungal Communities
   Decomposing Fine Roots in Coastal Temperate Rainforests}},
Journal = {{APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Fine root litter is the principal source of carbon stored in forest
   soils and a dominant source of carbon for fungal decomposers.
   Differences in decomposer capacity between fungal species may be
   important determinants of fine-root decomposition rates.
   Variable-retention harvesting (VRH) provides refuge for ectomycorrhizal
   fungi, but its influence on fine-root decomposers is unknown, as are the
   effects of functional shifts in these fungal communities on carbon
   cycling. We compared fungal communities decomposing fine roots (in
   litter bags) under VRH, clearcut, and uncut stands at two sites (6 and
   13 years postharvest) and two decay stages (43 days and 1 year after
   burial) in Douglas fir forests in coastal British Columbia, Canada.
   Fungal species and guilds were identified from decomposed fine roots
   using high-throughput sequencing. Variable retention had short-term
   effects on beta-diversity; harvest treatment modified the fungal
   community composition at the 6-year-postharvest site, but not at the
   13-year-postharvest site. Ericoid and ectomycorrhizal guilds were not
   more abundant under VRH, but stand age significantly structured species
   composition. Guild composition varied by decay stage, with ruderal
   species later replaced by saprotrophs and ectomycorrhizae.
   Ectomycorrhizal abundance on decomposing fine roots may partially
   explain why fine roots typically decompose more slowly than surface
   litter. Our results indicate that stand age structures fine-root
   decomposers but that decay stage is more important in structuring the
   fungal community than shifts caused by harvesting. The rapid postharvest
   recovery of fungal communities decomposing fine roots suggests
   resiliency within this community, at least in these young regenerating
   stands in coastal British Columbia.
   IMPORTANCE Globally, fine roots are a dominant source of carbon in
   forest soils, yet the fungi that decompose this material and that drive
   the sequestration or respiration of this carbon remain largely
   uncharacterized. Fungi vary in their capacity to decompose plant litter,
   suggesting that fungal community composition is an important determinant
   of decomposition rates. Variable-retention harvesting is a forestry
   practice that modifies fungal communities by providing refuge for
   ectomycorrhizal fungi. We evaluated the effects of variable retention
   and clear-cut harvesting on fungal communities decomposing fine roots at
   two sites (6 and 13 years postharvest), at two decay stages (43 days and
   1 year), and in uncut stands in temperate rainforests. Harvesting
   impacts on fungal community composition were detected only after 6 years
   after harvest. We suggest that fungal community composition may be an
   important factor that reduces fine-root decomposition rates relative to
   those of above-ground plant litter, which has important consequences for
   forest carbon cycling.}},

Abstract = {{Most scientific papers dealing with soil biota do not describe the humus
   form or even mention the humus type, although it's the habitat of
   micro-and macro-organisms, and the environment they contribute to
   create. Traditionally, and to a large extent, even today research into
   the topic of soil biology is rooted in agroecosystems. The humus context
   is neither a Mull nor a Moder but is more closely related to the former.
   In consequence, advance knowledge is poorly suited to the natural humus
   profile, notably to the Moder way of life, despite the number of studies
   concerning biodiversity. In this paper, Mull and Moder are taken as
   examples of contrasting life-styles. These two humus forms exhibit such
   dramatic differences that they support two different food webs enclosing
   high levels of unshared species diversity. A spectrum between Mull and
   Moder can be interpreted as a juxtaposition of hotspots coming from the
   two humus forms. Such an additive effect may explain much of the soil
   diversity enigma irrespectively of any other ecological determinants
   (soil, climate and vegetation).}},

Abstract = {{Land-use change in tropical dry forests can dramatically alter soil
   properties, but little is known about their resilience. We assessed soil
   resilience by examining resistance to, as well as recovery from, pasture
   use by smallholder farmers in western Mexico. We measured 25 soil and
   vegetation properties and compared old-growth forest (OGF) sites and
   pastures to evaluate resistance to pasture use. We assessed whether
   those properties recovered to OGF reference values after pasture
   abandonment by analyzing the trajectories of properties along a
   chronosequence of secondary vegetation. Finally, we assessed whether
   recovery of soil properties could be inferred from the recovery of
   vegetation properties. Nine out of 25 properties differed significantly
   between the OGF sites and pastures. From these nine nonresistant
   properties, six (i.e., penetration resistance, soil C concentration,
   soil C/N, basal area, individual density, rarefied species richness of
   woody vegetation) showed recovery as a significant positive relationship
   with forest age. In contrast, surface litter C, litter C/N, and soil
   available P showed no resistance and no recovery within the successional
   period examined (up to 35 y). The best vegetation indicator for the
   recovery of some soil properties was woody species richness. This may
   suggest that functional differences of colonizing plants matter for
   recovery after pasture use. Our findings indicate that soil was overall
   resilient to pasture use, but some properties did not recover
   synchronously with vegetation properties during succession. Thus, more
   attention should be paid to soil function, because full ecosystem
   recovery is often inferred from the recovery of vegetation properties.

Abstract = {{1. Woodland ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal species declined considerably
   in the Netherlands in the late 20th century, mainly due to raised levels
   of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Environmental measures have been
   taken to reduce this deposition, but it remains unclear whether and to
   what extent ECM species have benefitted from these.
   2. We hypothesized that ECM species, especially those species that are
   known to be nitrophobic, that is, sensitive to nitrogen loading, have
   recovered to some extent from the reduction in nitrogen deposition after
   1994. We further hypothesized that, due to legacy effects of deposition,
   recovery has been stronger in regions where deposition levels have
   previously been lower
   3. To test these hypotheses, we analysed long-term opportunistic data,
   that is, observations collected without standardized field method. We
   applied data filtering and a modified List Length method to adjust for
   potential biases in these data. The removal of bias left us with two
   periods to examine ECM species trends: before (1965-1985) and after
   (1994-2013) deposition reduction started {[}in 1994].
   4. We compared trends in ECM species in 1965-1985 with those in
   1994-2013. Multispecies indicators were used to summarize the findings
   of ECM species, and to compare these with results of litter saprotrophic
   species and wood saprotrophic and wood parasitic species.
   5. We found that (1) most trends switched in direction from negative to
   positive after the reduction in nitrogen deposition began; (2) these
   trends were more pronounced for nitrophobic ECM species than for
   nitrotolerant ECM species; (3) trends for ECM species differed from
   those of the other functional groups; and (4) recovery was stronger in
   the region with a history of lower deposition.
   6. Policy implications. Our results suggest that woodland
   ectomycorrhizal species benefit substantially from environmental
   measures to reduce nitrogen deposition. Our study is one of few
   scientific studies to date documenting evidence of success of
   large-scale (nation-wide) environmental measures. We have demonstrated
   that opportunistic citizen science data can be used for the detection of
   species trends, but it is essential to examine and control for potential
   bias in the data.}},

Abstract = {{The view that ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi commonly participate in the
   enzymatic liberation of nitrogen (N) from soil organic matter (SOM) has
   recently been invoked as a key mechanism governing the biogeochemical
   cycles of forest ecosystems. Here, we provide evidence that not all
   evolutionary lineages of ECM have retained the genetic potential to
   produce extracellular enzymes that degrade SOM, calling into question
   the ubiquity of the proposed mechanism. Further, we discuss several
   untested conditions that must be empirically validated before it is
   certain that any lineage of ECM fungi actively expresses extracellular
   enzymes in order to degrade SOM and transfer N contained therein to its

Abstract = {{Fungal Fungi diversity and community composition are mainly depending on
   soil and vegetation factors. However, the effects of these drivers on
   different fungal taxonomy and functional guilds remain largely
   unexplored, especially in subtropical forest ecosystems. The soil was
   collected from five dominate tree species forests: Castanopsis carlesii,
   Castanopsis fabri, Cinnamomum chekiangense, Schima superb, and
   Cunninghamia lanceolata in Wanmulin National Nature Reserve of
   South-eastern China. Fungal communities in rhizosphere and bulk soil
   were assessed employing ITS rDNA illumina sequencing. Ascomycota
   dominated the fungal community and most of them belong to Saprotrophic
   fungal group. On the genus level, Cladophialophora, Spirosphaera, and
   Podospora were dominate in soils of Castanopsis carlesii, Castanopsis
   fabri, and Cinnamomum chekiangense (> 50\% of the OTUs), respectively.
   Analysis of similarity showed that the Ascomycota and Saprotrophic fungi
   rather than total fungal community were significantly different among
   the soils with different dominant tree species. Furthermore, Ascomycota
   community were affected by soil C, C/N, and total K, while Saprotrophic
   fungi were explained by changes in tree richness, diameter at breast
   height and soil available P. In conclusion, our analyses revealed that
   the effects of dominant tree species on soil fungi are largely depend on
   different taxonomic and functional groups levels.}},

Abstract = {{Physical disturbance of soil profiles, even at shallow depths, is a
   ubiquitous consequence of anthropogenic landscape modification, with
   short-term impacts on important ecological guilds of fungi. DNA-based
   methods for surveying community composition are widely incorporated into
   studies attempting to explain fungal responses to forest ecosystem
   disturbances. Here we compare fungal community composition between three
   distinct soil profile manipulations (20 cm depth) and undisturbed
   control plots in a sub-boreal spruce forest in the Central Interior
   region of British Columbia, Canada. Fungal community composition
   differences were tracked by internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)
   amplicon sequencing, with comparisons drawn using genus-level
   annotations. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis
   indicated that disturbed-sample community compositions were similar to
   controls at 0 months and distinct from controls at 5- and 12-months post
   disturbance, but did not indicate clustering of samples according to
   disturbance regime. We used Linear Discriminant Effect Size (LEISe)
   analysis to identify fungal genera that consistently indicate disturbed
   or undisturbed (control) treatments across 5- and 12-month sampling
   times. Four fungal genera (Exophiala, Hyphodontiella, Mastigobasidium,
   and Umbelopsis) were detected with higher ranges of relative abundance
   in all disturbance regimes when compared to control plots. Deliberate
   mixing of LFH into mineral horizon soils stimulated multiple genera that
   were more frequently detectable in replicate plots at 12 months, when
   compared to undisturbed and immediately re-assembled plots. Four
   ectomycorrhizal genera (Amphinema, Cortinarius, Piloderma, and Russula)
   were identified as strong indicators of control plot soils. A single
   genus, Capronia, was identified as differentially abundant between
   stockpiled LFH and immediately replaced LFH. Our results are consistent
   with declines in ectomycorrhizal fungal abundance and increases in
   saprotroph abundance previously reported in DNA-based community
   profiling studies of forest soil disturbance. This investigation
   demonstrates that bulk soil sampling can be used to evaluate
   soil-handling regimens to understand fungal community
   disruption/recovery and highlights LEfSc as an approach to indicator
   selection in DNA-dependent biodiversity surveys.}},

Abstract = {{Litter fungal communities and their ligninolytic enzyme activities
   (laccase, Mn-peroxidase, and lignin-peroxidase) play a vital role in
   forest biogeochemical cycles by breaking down plant cell wall polymers,
   including recalcitrant lignin. However, litter fungal communities and
   ligninolytic enzyme activities have rarely been studied in Neotropical,
   non-coniferous forests. Here, we found no significant differences in
   litter ligninolytic enzyme activities from well preserved, moderately
   disturbed, and heavily disturbed Quercus deserticola Trel. forests in
   central Mexico. However, we did find seasonal effects on enzyme
   activities: during the dry season, we observed lower laccase, and
   increased Mn-peroxidase and lignin-peroxidase activities, and in the
   rainy season, Mn-peroxidase and lignin-peroxidase activities were lower,
   while laccase activity peaked. Fungal diversity (Shannon-Weaver and
   Simpson indices) based on ITS-rDNA analyses decreased with increased
   disturbance, and principal component analysis showed that litter fungal
   communities are structured differently between forest types. White-rot
   Polyporales and Auriculariales only occurred in the well preserved
   forest, and a high number of Ascomycota were shared between forests.
   While the degree of forest disturbance significantly affected the litter
   fungal community structure, the ligninolytic enzyme activities remained
   unaffected, suggesting functional redundancy and a possible role of
   generalist Ascomycota taxa in litter delignification. Forest
   conservation and restoration strategies must account for leaf litter and
   its associated fungal community.}},

Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{203-212}},

Abstract = {{Under a warming climate, the boreal forest could become one of the
   largest terrestrial net CO2 sources, as increasing disturbances and soil
   organic matter decomposition rates (heterotrophic respiration, Rh) could
   offset net primary production. Since soil represents the boreal forest's
   largest C pool, it is critical of correctly predicting fitture changes
   in Rh, as well as its sensitivity to temperature (Q(10) of Rh). We
   simulated a soil warming by transplanting soil cores from boreal balsam
   fir (Abies balsamea, BF) and black spruce (Picea mariana, BS) stands to
   a more southern Eastern hemlock stand (Tsuga canadensis, EH). We
   measured Rh and soil properties over 3 years, from June to October. Over
   three snow-free seasons, soil temperature (first 10 cm, including the FH
   organic layers) and Rh increased for BF (+ 3.2 degrees C, + 60\% of Rh)
   and BS cores (+ 2.3 degrees C, +27\% of Rh). Microbial C concentration
   decreased by 54-73\% in the FH layers of warmed and control cores
   relative to initial values, despite unchanged chemically labile C,
   probably due to excised roots and mycorrhizal hyphae. This suggests a
   possible underestimation of Rh during the experiment. In BF soils only,
   the increase in Rh was accompanied by an increase in its sensitivity to
   temperature. Under a + 5 degrees C soil warming, mean predicted Rh of BF
   soils would increase by 83\% rather than by 56\%. Relative to BS soils,
   such increase in sensitivity could be partly due to a higher fraction of
   chemically labile C (+ 52\%) in the FH layers and a higher mean warming
   effect. It suggests that for BF forest soils, predicting decomposition
   rates for a wanner climate based on current temperature sensitivities
   could be inadequate. However, longer-term studies are needed to see if
   this increase in Q(10) of Rh for BF soils would be maintained for longer
   periods.}},

Volume = {{116}},

Abstract = {{The production and mortality of extramatrical mycelia (EMM) of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi are poorly quantified despite their importance in
   soil carbon cycling in forests. Ingrowth bag/core methods are the most
   widely used but can not accurately assess temporal changes in EMM
   production and mortality, resulting in great uncertainty in annual
   estimates. A modified method using two mathematical models (Biomarker
   and Algebraic models) is proposed to quantify EMM production, mortality
   and decomposition over differing time periods by integrating EMM
   decomposition dynamics with ingrowth core/bag data. In the Biomarker
   model, EMM biomass and EMM total mass (sum of necromass and biomass) are
   assumed to be known by using chemical biomarkers as prodes. In the
   Mgebraic model, only the total mass is known and the biomass is
   calculated using an algebraic method. Model application in a loblolly
   pine plantation showed that mean monthly EMM production, mortality and
   decomposition estimates among three time periods ranged from 10.1 to
   16.0 kg ha(-1), 6.6-15.0 kg ha(-1), and 1.4-6.1 kg ha(-1), respectively,
   when using the Biomarker model, while these estimates ranged from 24.8
   to 35.7 kg ha(-1), 15.5-22.8 kg ha(-1), and 5.7-9.8 kg ha(-1),
   respectively, when using the Algebraic model, demonstrating the
   importance of assessing temporal changes. Model validation indicated
   that EMM estimates were more reliable for short-term compared to
   long-term incubation (184 vs. 322 days). Our method could improve EMM
   estimation by accurately assessing temporal changes in EMM production,
   mortality and decomposition in forests.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the central role of saprotrophic fungi in wood decomposition and

   endophytes (i.e. fungi that asymptomatically colonize living plant
   tissue) on decay remains poorly understood. In a 4-year field experiment
   in a boreal forest in the upper midwestern United States, we
   investigated whether endophytes influenced fungal community structure
   and subsequent wood decomposition via priority effects. We compared
   decay of sterilized and non-sterilized birch (Betulapapyrifera) logs
   using both high-throughput sequencing and wood physiochemical analyses
   (i.e. density loss, dilute alkali solubility, ratio of lignin loss
   relative to density loss). Endophyte presence significantly altered
   initial fungal species composition during the first 2years and enhanced
   mass loss over the experiment's duration. Results suggest that following
   tree death the immediate utilization of organic substrates by wood
   endophytes significantly alters establishment patterns of later arriving
   fungal saprotrophs. Independent of endophyte presence, white rot was the
   wood decay outcome at all sampling times, despite an initial presence of
   both brown and white rot fungi. Collectively, these findings demonstrate
   that wood endophytes can affect early community assembly and subsequent
   decay rates, although environmental filtering leads to consistent
   selection for fungi with lignin-targeted decay strategies.

Abstract = {{Natural disturbances alter the biophysical conditions of ecosystems,
   influencing patterns of structure, composition, and successional
   dynamics. Following high severity natural disturbance in forest
   ecosystems, land managers sometimes employ salvage harvesting to harvest
   trees killed or damaged by the disturbance agent. Despite its widespread
   practice, the effects of salvage harvesting on many ecosystem functions
   and species assemblages are still poorly understood. This study presents
   the first attempt to document and analyze the effects of salvage
   harvesting on macrofungal communities following catastrophic wind
   disturbance. On 27 April 2011, an EF3 tornado damaged forest stands
   within the Oakmulgee Ranger District of the Talladega National Forest in
   west-central Alabama, USA. Following the event, portions of some stands
   were subject to salvage harvesting. In 2016, we established three
   treatments, undisturbed, tornado disturbed, and salvage harvested, in
   stands that were dominated by Pinus palustris P. Miller prior to the
   2011 disturbance events. Throughout the sample period, 546 occurrences
   of 84 macrofungal species were recorded. Tornado disturbed areas hosted
   the highest macro fungal species richness overall. Undisturbed areas
   hosted the highest species richness for ectomycorrhizal macrofungi.
   Salvage harvested areas had reduced species richness for both
   saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal macrofungi compared to tornado
   disturbed plots. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination and
   permutational multivariate analysis of variance indicated that all three
   treatments differed in macrofungal community composition. The results
   indicated that salvage harvesting following catastrophic wind
   disturbance has the capacity to reduce macrofungal species richness and
   fruiting abundance. The reduction in deadwood volume and alterations to
   the ectomycorrhizal-associating plant community documented at salvage
   harvested sites is likely responsible for the observed differences in
   macrofungal fruiting patterns. The implications of reduced macro fungal
   richness in the early stages of forest development following
   catastrophic disturbance should be subject to long-term studies.}},

Abstract = {{Plants compete for nutrients using a range of strategies. We
   investigated nutrient foraging within nutrient hot-spots simultaneously
   available to plant species with diverse root traits. We hypothesized
   that there would be more root proliferation by thin-root species than by
   thick-root species, and that root proliferation by thin-root species
   would limit root proliferation by thick-root species. We conducted a
   root ingrowth experiment in a temperate forest in eastern USA where root
   systems of different tree species could interact. Tree species varied in
   the thickness of their absorptive roots, and were associated with either
   ectomycorrhizal (EM) or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Thus, there
   were thin- and thick-root AM and thin- and thick-root EM plant
   functional groups. Half the ingrowth cores were amended with organic
   nutrients (dried green leaves). Relative root length abundance, the
   proportion of total root length in a given soil volume occupied by a
   particular plant functional group, was calculated for the original root
   population and ingrowth roots after 6months. The shift in relative root
   length abundance from original to ingrowth roots was positive in
   thin-root species but negative in thick-root species (p<.001),
   especially in unamended patches (AM: +6\% vs. -7\%; EM: +8\% vs. -9\%).
   Being thin-rooted may thus allow a species to more rapidly recolonize
   soil after a disturbance, which may influence competition for nutrients.
   Moreover, we observed that nutrient additions amplified the shift in
   root length abundance of thin over thick roots in AM trees (+13\% vs.
   -14\%), but not in EM trees (+1\% vs -3\%). In contrast, phospholipid
   fatty acid biomarkers suggested that EM fungal hyphae strongly
   proliferated in nutrient hot-spots whereas AM fungal hyphae exhibited
   only modest proliferation. We found no evidence that when growing in the
   shared patch, the proliferation of thin roots inhibited the growth of
   thick roots.Synthesis. Knowledge of root morphology and mycorrhizal type
   of co-existing tree species may improve prediction of patch exploitation
   and nutrient acquisition in heterogeneous soils.}},

Abstract = {{Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is frequently planted as a monoculture,
   but it is also grown in mixed plantations with other native trees such
   as pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Both pine and oak form
   ectomycorrhizas that cover their roots and extend into the soil,
   facilitating tree water and nutrient uptake in exchange for
   photosynthetic carbon. Forming the interface between the soil and tree
   roots, mycorrhizal fungi are key drivers of biogeochemical cycling in
   terrestrial ecosystems and play an important role in the successful
   establishment of tree seedlings. They can, however, be susceptible to
   changes in the soil environment and in their hosts. Both environment and
   neighboring hosts affect how fungi colonize roots and may affect their
   host preference. Despite the importance of mycorrhizal fungi in forest
   ecosystems, little is known about the biodiversity and functional
   effects of mycorrhizal communities in mixed compared with monoculture
   plantations. Changes in mycorrhizal richness and composition can result
   in changes in functional groups with consequences for forest ecosystem
   stability and functioning. We compared pine mycorrhizas in eight mixed

   explained over 50\% of the variation in pine mycorrhizal communities.
   Different environmental factors affected taxonomic and functional

   to associate with more fungi in the presence of oak, but the abiotic
   environment exerted a stronger influence than oak presence on pine
   mycorrhizal diversity.}},

Abstract = {{As a source of suspended soils', epiphytes contribute large amounts of
   organic matter to the canopy of tropical rain forests. Microbes
   associated with epiphytes are responsible for much of the nutrient
   cycling taking place in rain forest canopies. However, soils suspended
   far above the ground in living organisms differ from soil on the forest
   floor, and traditional predictors of soil microbial community
   composition and functioning (nutrient availability and the activity of
   soil organisms) are likely to be less important. We conducted an
   experiment in the rain forest biome at the Eden Project in the U.K. to
   explore how biotic and abiotic conditions determine microbial community
   composition and functioning in a suspended soil. To simulate their
   natural epiphytic lifestyle, bird's nest ferns (Asplenium nidus) were
   placed on a custom-built canopy platform suspended 8 m above the ground.
   Ammonium nitrate and earthworm treatments were applied to ferns in a
   factorial design. Extracellular enzyme activity and Phospholipid Fatty
   Acid (PLFA) profiles were determined at zero, three and six months. We
   observed no significant differences in either enzyme activity or PLFA
   profiles between any of the treatments. Instead, we observed decreases
   in beta-glucosidase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase activity, and an
   increase in phenol oxidase activity across all treatments and controls
   over time. An increase in the relative abundance of fungi during the
   experiment meant that the microbial communities in the Eden Project
   ferns after six months were comparable with ferns sampled from primary
   tropical rain forest in Borneo.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we address total glomalin-related soil protein (T-GRSP) as
   a possible indicator of differences in forest soils related to reactive
   nitrogen and forest composition. We focused especially on the
   relationship between T-GRSP (g kg(-1)), soil organic carbon (SOC), and
   reactive nitrogen (N-r) availability among different categories of
   temperate forests and different horizons. Our study included 105
   sampling sites divided into 5 categories, which vary in elevation and
   tree species composition (coniferous, deciduous, mixed). We detected
   significantly higher T-GRSP and SOC in the F+H horizon under conifers.
   We assume that this observation might be attributed to suppression of
   decomposition of T-GRSP and SOC by nature of coniferous litter. The lack
   of significant differences in T-GRSP/SOC among the categories and the
   positive correlations between T-GRSP and SOC in most of the categories
   confirmed the strong relationship of T-GRSP with SOC. We found a
   significantly higher content of T-GRSP in the F+H horizon for all
   studied forest categories. However, the contribution of T-GRSP to SOC is
   significantly higher in the Ahorizon, which might be caused by
   stabilization of glomalin by mineral fraction, including clay minerals
   or by the belowground origin of glomalin. We found the increase of SOC
   with increasing N-r in the Ahorizon for most categories of forest.
   T-GRSP follows this trend in the case of deciduous forests (decid),
   mixed forest (mixed), and mountain forests (mount). On the other hand,
   we detected a decrease of T-GRSP with increasing N-r in the F+H horizon
   of coniferous forests (conif). Moreover the T-GRSP/SOC decreases with
   the increase of N-r in the Ahorizon of conif, mixed and mount, which
   points to the higher sensitivity of forest with prevalence of coniferous
   trees. Our observations have confirmed an ecosystem-specific
   relationship between T-GRSP, SOC and N-r. We concluded that T-GRSP in
   combination with T-GRSP/SOC has the potential to reveal qualitative
   changes in soil organic matter (SOM) connected with increasing N-r.}},

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are important mutualists for the growth and
   health of most boreal trees. Forest age and its host species composition
   can impact the composition of ECM fungal communities. Although plentiful
   empirical data exist for forested environments, the effects of
   established vegetation and its successional trajectories on ECM fungi in
   urban greenspaces remain poorly understood. We analyzed ECM fungi in 5
   control forests and 41 urban parks of two plant functional groups
   (conifer and broadleaf trees) and in three age categories (10, similar
   to 50, and > 100 years old) in southern Finland. Our results show that
   although ECM fungal richness was marginally greater in forests than in
   urban parks, urban parks still hosted rich and diverse ECM fungal
   communities. ECM fungal community composition differed between the two
   habitats but was driven by taxon rank order reordering, as key ECM
   fungal taxa remained largely the same. In parks, the ECM communities
   differed between conifer and broadleaf trees. The successional
   trajectories of ECM fungi, as inferred in relation to the time since
   park construction, differed among the conifers and broadleaf trees: the
   ECM fungal communities changed over time under the conifers, whereas
   communities under broadleaf trees provided no evidence for such
   age-related effects. Our data show that plant-ECM fungus interactions in
   urban parks, in spite of being constructed environments, are
   surprisingly similar in richness to those in natural forests. This
   suggests that the presence of host trees, rather than soil
   characteristics or even disturbance regime of the system, determine ECM
   fungal community structure and diversity.
   IMPORTANCE In urban environments, soil and trees improve environmental
   quality and provide essential ecosystem services. ECM fungi enhance
   plant growth and performance, increasing plant nutrient acquisition and
   protecting plants against toxic compounds. Recent evidence indicates
   that soil-inhabiting fungal communities, including ECM and saprotrophic
   fungi, in urban parks are affected by plant functional type and park
   age. However, ECM fungal diversity and its responses to urban stress,
   plant functional type, or park age remain unknown. The significance of
   our study is in identifying, in greater detail, the responses of ECM
   fungi in the rhizospheres of conifer and broadleaf trees in urban parks.
   This will greatly enhance our knowledge of ECM fungal communities under
   urban stresses, and the findings can be utilized by urban planners to
   improve urban ecosystem services.}},

   saprotrophic basidiomycetes increased in deeper organic layers, at the

   positively with the activity of oxidative enzymes, which in turn

   Combined, our findings are consistent with a fungus-mediated feedback

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) constitutes the largest terrestrial C pool. An
   emerging, untested, view is that oxidation and depolymerization of SOM

   laboratory-scale experiments involving one ectomycorrhizal and one
   saprotrophic fungus that represent the two major functional groups of

   enhanced the retention of SOM on goethite, partly because of oxidative
   modifications of organic matter (OM) by the fungi. Moreover, both fungi
   secreted substantial amounts (>10\% new biomass C) of aromatic
   metabolites that also contributed to an enhanced mineral retention of
   OM. Our study demonstrates that soil fungi can form mineral-stabilized
   SOM not only by oxidative conversion of the SOM but also by synthesizing

Abstract = {{By reducing soil organic matter and litter input, land-use changes are
   predicted to decrease total soil fungal diversity, but at functional
   levels this have been poorly studied. It is expected, though, that
   increasing disturbance decreases saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi
   biodiversity. This study aimed to determine the effects of land-use
   changes on the phylogenetic and functional diversity of soil fungi in
   the Southern Andes. We assessed the fungal communities of Andosol
   topsoil at 1 cm and 10 cm soil depth. The soil samples were obtained
   from a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance; specifically, plots were
   located within pristine forest, overstory-managed, and clear-cut
   conditions. We used a cultivation-independent molecular barcoding
   approach to assess fungal diversity and identify 1,173 OTUs from which
   401 were assigned to a functional guild. While we found higher
   phylogenetic richness in clear-cut conditions, these soils had higher
   relative abundances of plant pathogen fungi and lower relative
   abundances of saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi compared to the
   other treatments. The opposite pattern was found in pristine forest.
   Thus, fungal species richness itself does not seem to reflect ecosystem
   health. Interestingly though, the lower phylogenetic diversity found in
   pristine forest was compensated by a higher diversity of fungi involved

Abstract = {{Previous studies have revealed inconsistent correlations between fungal

   we investigated the internal relationships between soil fungal diversity
   and plant/soil properties on the Loess Plateau following vegetation
   restoration, using Illumina sequencing of the internal transcribed
   spacer 2 (ITS2) region for fungal identification. We found significant
   effects of land use types (Af, Artificial forest; Ns, Natural shrub; Ag,

   fungal communities composition, and the dominant phyla were Ascomycota,
   Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota, which transitioned from

   of Ns > Af > Ng > Ag > Sc, and the total number of OTUs varied widely.
   In contrast, Good's coverage and Simpson's diversity indicated no

   analysis showed that plant and soil properties were closely related to
   fungal diversity regardless of land use types. In addition, soil organic
   carbon (SOC) and H-plant (plant richness, Shannon-Wiener index) were
   strong driving factors that explained fungal diversity. As revealed by
   the structural equation model (SEM) and generalized additive models

Abstract = {{Background and aims - Many South American ecosystems remain unexplored
   and neglected as to the occurrence and distribution of fungi. Data about
   occurrence of sporocarp forming hypogeous fungi in Atlantic rainforests
   and Caatinga biome are even less frequently published. For this reason,
   intensive studies on this group are needed. During studies of hypogeous
   sequestrate fungi in Northeastern Brazil several sclerotium-like
   structures were encountered in soil and here determined based on
   phylogenetic affiliation.
   Methods - The fungal structures in soils were sampled by raking the
   litter and top soil organic layer at four different forest sites, all
   located in the Atlantic rainforest or in the `brejo de altitude' (upland
   wet forest enclaves) of the Atlantic rainforest remnants within the
   Caatinga biome. Samples were studied by optical microscopy and molecular
   analyses. Internal Transcribed Spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS
   nrDNA) sequences (barcoding of fungi) were used to identify some
   selected specimens.
   Key results - Among the nine sclerotium samples, four were related to
   the /trechisporales lineage, three related to /entolomataceae, and two
   to the /amylocorticiales lineages.
   Conclusions - This study provides new information about
   sclerotium-forming fungi occurring naturally in soils and litter layers
   from native Atlantic rainforests in Brazil. It is a starting point for
   more detailed and systematic studies planned for epigeous and hypogeous
   sequestrate fungi. Such studies are needed to understand the
   distribution, evolutionary affiliations and trophic modes of those
   fungi.}},

Abstract = {{The predictive power of climate models is limited by an incomplete
   understanding of the controls on fine root decomposition and thus
   belowground carbon cycling. To more accurately model rates of decay,
   fine root heterogeneity needs to be addressed in fine root decomposition
   studies. Branching order integrates both structural and chemical
   properties that are important in indicating litter quality and decay
   rate.
   We discuss current views on the controls and patterns of fine root
   decomposition in combination with recent findings related to the effects
   of branching order and mycorrhizal decomposition. We examine the
   counterintuitive finding that nitrogen rich, lower order roots decompose
   more slowly than woody, higher order roots in temperate and sub-tropical
   forests.
   We posit that slower decomposition of first and second compared to
   higher order roots might be caused by the poor carbon quality associated
   with higher concentrations of phenols in lower order roots or by
   inhibition of saprophytes by the mycorrhizal fungi that often
   preferentially inhabit these roots. Alternatively, apparent
   recalcitrance of lower order roots could be an experimental artifact
   caused by severing pre-mortem mycelial connections during sample
   processing, or exclusion of animals that graze fungal structures by the
   small mesh sizes characteristic of litterbags. To better predict the
   residence time of the carbon contained in the entire fine root pool,
   existing methods should be applied to individual root orders when
   practical. New methods for characterizing decomposition of undisturbed
   roots that have senesced naturally are greatly needed.}},

Abstract = {{Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Plant Health
   (PLH) Panelperformed a pestcategorisation of
   Pseudocercosporapini-densiflorae, a well-defined and distinguishable
   fungal species of the family Mycosphaerellaceae. The regulated harmful
   organism is the anamorph Cercoseptoriapini-densiflorae (synonym
   Cercosporapini-densiflorae) with the corresponding teleomorph
   Mycosphaerellagibsonii. P.pini-densiflorae causes a needle blight of
   Pinus spp. also known as Cercospora blight of pines or Cercospora needle
   blight. P.pini-densiflorae is reported from sub-Saharan Africa, Central
   and South America, Asia and Oceania, but not from the EU. The pathogen
   is regulated in Council Directive 2000/29/EC (Annex IIAI) as a
   quarantine organism whose introduction into the EU is banned on plants
   (other than fruit and seeds) and wood of Pinus. The pest could enter the
   EU via plants for planting and other means (uncleaned seed, cut branches
   of pine trees, isolated bark, growing media accompanying plants, and
   mycorrhizal soil inocula). Hosts are widespread in the EU and favourable
   climatic conditions are present in Mediterranean countries.
   Pinushalepensis, Pinusnigra, Pinuspinea, Pinuspinaster and
   Pinussylvestris are reported to be highly susceptible to the pathogen.
   The pest would be able to spread following establishment after
   introduction in the EU mainly on infected plants for planting. The pest
   introduction could have impacts in nurseries and young plantations.
   Cleaning seeds from needles and removing infected seedlings and pine
   litter from affected nurseries can reduce the risk of establishment in
   nurseries and of spread from nurseries to forests, especially given the
   limited scale of splash dispersal. The main knowledge gaps concern (i)
   the role of means of entry/spread other than plants for planting and
   (ii) the potential consequences in mature tree plantations and forests.
   The criteria assessed by the Panelfor consideration as potential
   quarantine pest are met. For regulated non-quarantine pests, the
   criterion on the pest presence in the EU is not met. (C) 2017 European

Abstract = {{1. Forest pests drive tree mortality through disruption of functional
   traits linked to nutrient acquisition, growth and reproduction. The
   impacts of attack by individual or multiple above-ground herbivores on
   root functional traits critical to tree health have received little
   attention. This is especially true for exotic herbivores, organisms
   often found in disturbed forests.
   2. We excavated whole-root systems from eastern hemlock (Tsuga
   canadensis) individuals experimentally infested with hemlock woolly
   adelgid (HWA: Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (EHS: Fiorina
   externa) individually, or in combination, for periods of 2 and 4 years.
   Below-ground root biomass, functional traits and storage nutrients were
   measured to assess impacts of herbivory. We also quantified
   ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) colonisation of fine roots and used
   culture-independent methods to examine EMF diversity.
   3. Trees infested with HWA had a greater root mass fraction (root to
   total biomass ratio), although feeding had no observable effects on root
   functional traits (e. g. specific root length) or on resource allocation
   to roots. HWA feeding did significantly reduce EMF colonisation of
   hemlock fine roots, though surprisingly, EMF diversity and that of other
   fungal associates were unaffected. In contrast to HWA, EHS (alone or in
   conjunction with HWA) feeding had no observable effect on below- ground
   traits or EMF colonisation alone; however, its presence mediated HWA
   effects when trees were co-infested. Simultaneous infestation within the
   same year yielded significant reductions in EMF colonisation, whereas
   prior EHS attack weakened HWA effects.
   4. Our results collectively suggest that prior EHS attack dampens the
   impact of HWA on below-ground functional traits. This highlights how the
   timing and sequence of herbivore arrival can alter plant-mediated
   interactions between herbivores and their effects on above-below-ground
   linkages and associated tree health.}},

Title = {{Tamm Review: On the nature of the nitrogen limitation to plant growth in
   Fennoscandian boreal forests}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{The supply of nitrogen commonly limits plant production in boreal
   forests and also affects species composition and ecosystem functions
   other than plant growth. These interrelations vary across the
   landscapes, with the highest N availability, plant growth and plant
   species richness in ground-water discharge areas (GDAs), typically in
   toe-slope positions, which receive solutes leaching from the much larger
   groundwater recharge areas (GRAs) uphill. Plant N sources include not
   only inorganic N, but, as heightened more recently, also organic N
   species. In general, also the ratio inorganic N over organic N sources
   increase down hillslopes. Here, we review recent evidence about the
   nature of the N limitation and its variations in Fennoscandian boreal
   forests and discuss its implications for forest ecology and management.
   The rate of litter decomposition has traditionally been seen as the
   determinant of the rate of N supply. However, while N-rich litter
   decomposes faster than N-poor litter initially, N-rich litter then
   decomposes more slowly, which means that the relation between N \% of
   litter and its decomposability is complex. Moreover, in the lower part
   of themor-layer, where the most superficial mycorrhizal roots first
   appear, and N availability matters for plants, the ratio of microbial N
   over total soil N is remarkably constant over the wide range in litter
   and soil C/N ratios of between 15 and 40 for N-rich and N-poor sites,
   respectively. Nitrogen-rich and-poor sites thus differ in the sizes of
   the total N pool and the microbial N pool, but not in the ratio between
   them. A more important difference is that the soil microbial N pool
   turns over faster in N -rich systems because the microbes are more
   limited by C, while microbes in N-poor systems are a stronger sink for
   available N.
   Furthermore, litter decomposition in the most superficial soil horizon
   (as studied by the so-called litter-bag method) is associated with a
   dominance of saprotrophic fungi, and absence of mycorrhizal fungi. The
   focal zone in the context of plant N supply in N-limited forests is
   further down the soil profile, whereectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots become
   abundant. Molecular evidence and stable isotope data indicate that in
   the typical N-poor boreal forests, nitrogen is retained in saprotrophic
   fungi, likely until they run out of energy (available C-compounds).
   Then, as heightened by recent research, ECM fungi, which are supplied by
   photosynthate from the trees, become the superior competitors for N.
   In N-poor boreal soils strong N retention by microorganisms keeps levels
   of available N very low. This is exacerbated by an increase in tree C
   allocation to mycorrhizal fungi (TCAM) relative to net primary
   production (NPP) with decreasing soil N supply, which causes ECM fungi
   to retain much of the available soil N for their own growth and transfer
   little to their tree hosts. The transfer of N through the ECM fungi, and
   not the rate of litter decomposition, is likely limiting the rate of
   tree N supply under such conditions. All but a few stress-tolerant less
   N-demanding plant species, like the ECM trees themselves and ericaceous
   dwarf shrubs, are excluded.
   With increasing N supply, a weakening of ECM symbiosis caused by the
   relative decline in TCAM contributes to shifts in soil microbial
   community composition from fungal dominance to bacterial dominance.
   Thus, bacteria, which are less C-demanding, but more likely to release N
   than fungi, take over. This, and the relatively high pH in GDA, allow
   autotrophic nitrifying bacteria to compete successfully for the NH4+
   released by C-limited organisms and causes the N cycle to open up with
   leaching of nitrate (NO) and gaseous N losses through denitrification.
   These N-rich conditions allow species-rich communities of N-demanding
   plant species. Meanwhile, ECM fungi have a smaller biomass, are supplied
   with N in excess of their demand and will export more N to their host
   trees. Hence, the gradient from low to high N supply is characterized by
   profound variations in plant and soil microbial physiologies, especially
   their relations to the C-to-N supply ratio. We propose how interactions
   among functional groups can be understood and modelled (the
   plant-microbe carbon-nitrogen model).
   With regard to forest management these perspectives explain why the
   creation of larger tree-free gaps favors the regeneration of tree
   seedlings under N-limited conditions through reduced belowground
   competition for N, and why such gaps are less important under high N
   supply (but when light might be limiting). We also discuss perspectives
   on the relations between N supply, biodiversity, and eutrophication of
   boreal forests from N deposition or forest fertilization. (C) 2017 The

   Community}},

Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Leaf and root litter decomposition has been a major research focus.
   However, the possible effects of belowground microbial community
   structure and diversity on this process are poorly understood.
   Understanding the biochemical mechanisms controlling aboveground
   decomposition processes is important to predict the changes of soil
   carbon and nutrient cycling in response to changes of forest management
   regimes. Here, we explore the biochemical controls of leaf and fine root
   decomposition in three subtropical plantations (Ford Erythrophleum
   (Erythrophleum fordii Oliver), Masson Pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.)),
   and a mixed plantation containing both species) using the litterbag
   method, and soil microbial communities were determined using
   phospholipid fatty acid profiles. Overall, leaves decomposed more
   rapidly than fine roots, potentially due to the faster degradation of
   their cellulose component, but not lignin. In addition, leaf and fine
   root decomposition rates varied among plantations, being higher in E.
   fordii and lower in P. massoniana. Substrate quality such as N, Ca,
   lignin concentration, and C/N ratio were responsible for the
   decomposition rate changes among plantation types. Moreover, we used
   redundancy analysis to examine the relationships between litter
   decomposition and soil microbial community composition and diversity.
   Results revealed that actinobacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   community were the key determinants affecting leaf and fine root litter
   decomposition, respectively. Our work demonstrates that litter
   decomposition was linked to substrate quality and to the structure of
   soil microbial communities, and evidences the probable role of E. fordii
   in increasing soil nutrient availability, especially N, P and Ca.
   Additional data on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) or DNA marker groups
   within the litterbags over time may provide insights into litter
   decomposition dynamics, which represents potential objectives for future
   long-term decomposition studies.}},

Abstract = {{The growing demand for renewable, carbon-neutral materials and energy is
   leading to intensified forest land-use. The long-term ecological
   challenges associated with maintaining soil fertility in managed forests
   are not yet known, in part due to the complexity of soil microbial
   communities and the heterogeneity of forest soils. This study determined
   the long-term effects of timber harvesting, accompanied by varied
   organic matter (OM) removal, on bacterial and fungal soil populations in
   11-to 17-year-old reforested coniferous plantations at 18 sites across
   North America. Analysis of highly replicated 16 S rRNA gene and ITS
   region pyrotag libraries and shotgun metagenomes demonstrated consistent
   changes in microbial communities in harvested plots that included the
   expansion of desiccation-and heat-tolerant organisms and decline in
   diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, the majority of taxa,
   including the most abundant and cosmopolitan groups, were unaffected by
   harvesting. Shifts in microbial populations that corresponded to
   increased temperature and soil dryness were moderated by OM retention,
   which also selected for sub-populations of fungal decomposers.
   Biogeographical differences in the distribution of taxa as well as local
   edaphic and environmental conditions produced substantial variation in
   the effects of harvesting. This extensive molecular-based investigation
   of forest soil advances our understanding of forest disturbance and lays
   the foundation for monitoring long-term impacts of timber harvesting.}},

Title = {{Root and Rhizosphere Bacterial Phosphatase Activity Varies with Tree
   Species and Soil Phosphorus Availability in Puerto Rico Tropical Forest}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Tropical forests generally occur on highly weathered soils that, in
   combination with the immobility of phosphorus (P), often result in soils
   lacking orthophosphate, the form of P most easily metabolized by plants
   and microbes. In these soils, mineralization of organic P can be the
   major source for orthophosphate. Both plants and microbes encode for
   phosphatases capable of mineralizing a range of organic P compounds.
   However, the activity of these enzymes depends on several edaphic
   factors including P availability, tree species, and microbial
   communities. Thus, phosphatase activity in both roots and the root
   microbial community constitute an important role in P mineralization and
   P nutrient dynamics that are not well studied in tropical forests. To
   relate phosphatase activity of roots and bacteria in tropical forests,
   we measured phosphatase activity in roots and bacterial isolates as well
   as bacterial community composition from the rhizosphere. Three forests
   in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico were selected to represent a
   range of soil P availability as measured using the resin P method.
   Within each site, a minimum of three tree species were chosen to sample.
   Root and bacterial phosphatase activity were both measured using a
   colorimetric assay with para-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate for
   the phosphomonoesterase enzyme. Both root and bacterial phosphatase were
   chiefly influenced by tree species. Though tree species was the only
   significant factor in root phosphatase activity, there was a negative
   trend between soil P availability and phosphatase activity in linear
   regressions of average root phosphatase and resin P. Permutational
   multivariate analysis of variance of bacterial community composition
   based on 16S amplicon sequencing indicated that bacterial composition
   was strongly controlled by soil P availability (p-value < 0.05). These
   results indicate that although root and bacterial phosphatase activity
   were influenced by tree species; bacterial community composition was
   chiefly influenced by P availability. Although the sample size is
   limited given the tremendous diversity of tropical forests, our study
   indicates the importance of roots and bacterial function to
   understanding phosphatase activity. Future work will broaden the
   diversity of tree species and microbial members sampled to provide
   insight into P mineralization and model representation of tropical
   forests.}},

Abstract = {{The nitrate to ammonium ratios in nitrogen (N) compounds in wet
   atmospheric deposits have increased over the recent past, which is a
   cause for some concern as the individual effects of nitrate and ammonium
   deposition on the biomass of different soil microbial communities and
   enzyme activities are still poorly defined. We established a field
   experiment and applied ammonium (NH4Cl) and nitrate (NaNO3) at monthly
   intervals over a period of 4 years. We collected soil samples from the
   ammonium and nitrate treatments and control plots in three different
   seasons, namely spring, summer, and fall, to evaluate the how the
   biomass of different soil microbial communities and enzyme activities
   responded to the ammonium (NH4Cl) and nitrate (NaNO3) applications. Our
   results showed that the total contents of phospholipid fatty acids
   (PLFAs) decreased by 24 and 11\% in the ammonium and nitrate treatments,
   respectively. The inhibitory effects of ammonium on Gram-positive
   bacteria (G(+)) and bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, and arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) PLFA contents ranged from 14 to 40\% across the
   three seasons. We also observed that the absolute activities of C, N,
   and P hydrolyses and oxidases were inhibited by ammonium and nitrate,
   but that nitrate had stronger inhibitory effects on the activities of
   acid phosphatase (AP) than ammonium. The activities of N-acquisition
   specific enzymes (enzyme activities normalized by total PLFA contents)
   were about 21 and 43\% lower in the ammonium and nitrate treatments than
   in the control, respectively. However, the activities of P-acquisition
   specific enzymes were about 19\% higher in the ammonium treatment than
   in the control. Using redundancy analysis (RDA), we found that the
   measured C, N, and P hydrolysis and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities
   were positively correlated with the soil pH and ammonium contents, but
   were negatively correlated with the nitrate contents. The PLFA biomarker
   contents were positively correlated with soil pH, soil organic carbon
   (SOC), and total N contents, but were negatively correlated with the
   ammonium contents. The soil enzyme activities varied seasonally, and
   were highest in March and lowest in October. In contrast, the contents
   of the microbial PLFA biomarkers were higher in October than in March
   and June. Ammonium may inhibit the contents of PLFA biomarkers more
   strongly than nitrate because of acidification. This study has provided
   useful information about the effects of ammonium and nitrate on soil
   microbial communities and enzyme activities.}},

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhiza is a mutualistic symbiosis of paramount importance in the
   functioning of forest ecosystems. Therefore, inoculation with
   ectomycorrhizal fungi, particularly edible species, has gained enormous
   relevance in the production of forest trees with economic importance.
   However, due to technical difficulties for the cultivation of
   ectomycorrhizal basidiomata associated with their host trees, factors
   influencing basidiomata formation have not been fully understood. This
   study evaluated the effect of two light wavelengths on the production of
   basidiomata of two edible ectomycorrhizal mushroom species (Hebeloma
   leucosarx and Laccaria bicolor) associated with two neo-tropical trees,
   Pinus montezumae and Pinus greggii. The two fungal species evaluated are
   widely used as food and sold in traditional markets in Mexico. In
   general, the type of light differentially influenced the basidioma
   formation of these fungi in association with host seedlings in
   greenhouse during six years. Increased basidioma formation of H.
   leucosarx was observed associated with trees growing in pots covered
   with yellow filters with a wavelength of similar to 590 nm compared with
   those covered with red filters with a wavelength of similar to 660 nm.
   Meanwhile, the opposite trend was observed in basidiomata of L. bicolor.
   The host tree species influenced the formation of basidiomata. Hebeloma
   leucosarx produced more basidiomata in association with P. montezumae
   than with P. greggii. In addition, a description of basidiomata
   formation from very young stages previous to senescence is provided for
   both mycobionts. To our knowledge, this is the first record of the
   effect of light wavelengths on the production of basidiomata of edible
   ectomycorrhizal mushrooms, demonstrating that this phenomenon is more
   complex than previously believed.}},

Abstract = {{It has been predicted that the precipitation and atmospheric nitrogen
   (N) deposition will increase in northern China. Though a variety of
   publications have documented the effects of increased precipitation and
   N deposition on aboveground plant community, the responses of soil
   microbial community composition and function to these possible global
   changes still remain largely unknown. In this study, we take advantage
   of a long-term (9-year) field experiment that was established in a
   typical steppe in Inner Mongolia, China. The responses of microbial
   community composition and soil enzymatic activities to simulated N
   deposition and increased precipitation were examined. It was found that
   the low level of N addition showed no influence on the relative
   abundance of bacteria, but the relatively high N deposition increased
   the relative abundance of bacteria. The increased precipitation in
   combination with N addition, estimated at all N levels, significantly
   decreased the relative abundance of fungi and fungi/bacteria ratio.
   Increased precipitation played important roles in enhancing microbial
   activity in this semi-arid region. It was observed that water supply
   increased the activities of the five of the enzymes determined,
   including peroxidase (PER), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), beta-Glucosidase
   (BG), protease (PRO) and alkaline phosphomonoesterase (alkaline PME).
   The activity of cellulase was reduced by long-term increased
   precipitation treatment, but was stimulated by simulated N deposition,
   which may due to the changes in litter components under projected
   climate change. The influences of N deposition on the microbial
   enzymatic activities might be alleviated (such as PER), strengthened
   (acid PME), or not affected by the projected precipitation increment. We
   also found that the overall changes in soil enzymatic activity patterns
   are more sensitive to environmental changes than the variations in soil
   microbial community composition, which may be explained by the microbial
   function redundancy and the limitations of research method. By all
   accounts, in future scenarios of increased precipitation in combination
   with N deposition, the proportion of soil fungi would be reduced, and
   the microbial community composition might be shifted to be
   bacteria-dominant. We also predicted that with the increasing of N
   deposition level, the activities of cellulolase would be enhanced,
   whereas the activities of ligninolytic enzymes (PER and PPO) would be
   reduced sharply.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of biodiversity on productivity are more likely to be expressed
   when there is greater potential for niche complementarity. In soil,
   chemically complex pools of nutrient resources should provide more
   opportunities for niche complementarity than chemically simple pools.
   Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal genotypes can exhibit substantial variation
   in nutrient acquisition traits and are key components of soil
   biodiversity. Here, we tested the hypothesis that increasing the
   chemical complexity and forms of soil nutrients would enhance the
   effects of intraspecific ECM diversity on host plant and fungal
   productivity. In pure culture, we found substantial variation in growth
   of strains of the ECM fungus Laccaria bicolor on a range of inorganic
   and organic forms of nutrients. Subsequent experiments examined the
   effects of intraspecific identity and richness using Scots pine (Pinus
   sylvestris) seedlings colonized with different strains of L. bicolor
   growing on substrates supplemented with either inorganic or organic
   forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. Intraspecific identity effects on
   plant productivity were only found under the inorganic nutrient
   amendment, whereas intraspecific identity affected fungal productivity
   to a similar extent under both nutrient treatments. Overall, there were
   no significant effects of intraspecific richness on plant and fungal
   productivity. Our findings suggest soil nutrient composition does not
   interact strongly with ECM intraspecific richness, at least under
   experimental conditions where mineral nutrients were not limiting. Under
   these conditions, intraspecific identity of ECM fungi becomes more
   important than richness in modulating plant and fungal performance.}},

Title = {{Feed in summer, rest in winter: microbial carbon utilization in forest
   topsoil}},
Journal = {{MICROBIOME}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Evergreen coniferous forests contain high stocks of organic
   matter. Significant carbon transformations occur in litter and soil of
   these ecosystems, making them important for the global carbon cycle. Due
   to seasonal allocation of photosynthates to roots, carbon availability
   changes seasonally in the topsoil. The aim of this paper was to describe
   the seasonal differences in C source utilization and the involvement of
   various members of soil microbiome in this process.
   Results: Here, we show that microorganisms in topsoil encode a diverse
   set of carbohydrate-active enzymes, including glycoside hydrolases and
   auxiliary enzymes. While the transcription of genes encoding enzymes
   degrading reserve compounds, such as starch or trehalose, was high in
   soil in winter, summer was characterized by high transcription of
   ligninolytic and cellulolytic enzymes produced mainly by fungi. Fungi
   strongly dominated the transcription in litter and an equal contribution
   of bacteria and fungi was found in soil. The turnover of fungal biomass
   appeared to be faster in summer than in winter, due to high activity of
   enzymes targeting its degradation, indicating fast growth in both litter
   and soil. In each enzyme family, hundreds to thousands of genes were
   typically transcribed simultaneously.
   Conclusions: Seasonal differences in the transcription of glycoside
   hydrolases and auxiliary enzyme genes are more pronounced in soil than
   in litter. Our results suggest that mainly fungi are involved in
   decomposition of recalcitrant biopolymers in summer, while bacteria
   replace them in this role in winter. Transcripts of genes encoding
   enzymes targeting plant biomass biopolymers, reserve compounds and
   fungal cell walls were especially abundant in the coniferous forest
   topsoil.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive land expansion of commercial oil palm agricultural lands
   results in reducing the size of peat swamp forests, particularly in
   Southeast Asia. The effect of this land conversion on macrofungal
   biodiversity is, however, understudied. We quantified macrofungal
   biodiversity by identifying mushroom sporocarps throughout four
   different habitats; logged peat swamp forest, large-scale oil palm
   plantation, monoculture, and polyculture smallholdings. We recorded a
   total of 757 clusters of macrofungi belonging to 127 morphospecies and
   found that substrates forgrowing macrofungi were abundant in peat swamp
   forest; hence, morphospecies richness and macrofungal clusters were
   significantly greater in logged peat swamp forest than converted oil
   palm agriculture lands. Environmental factors that influence macrofungi
   in logged peat swamp forests such as air temperature, humidity, wind
   speed, soil pH, and soil moisture were different from those in oil palm
   plantations and smallholdings. We conclude that peat swamp forests are
   irreplaceable with respect to macrofungal biodiversity. They host much
   greater macrofungal biodiversity than any of the oil palm agricultural
   lands. It is imperative that further expansion of oil palm plantation
   into remaining peat swamp forests should be prohibited in palm oil
   producing countries. These results imply that macrofungal distribution
   reflects changes in microclimate between habitats and reduced
   macrofungal biodiversity may adversely affect decomposition in
   human-modified landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the interaction between fungal communities of soil and

   identification and stable isotope tracking to both soil and decaying
   wood in an unmanaged boreal Norway spruce-dominated stand. Altogether,
   we recorded 1990 operational taxonomic units, out of which more than 600
   were shared by both substrates and 589 were found to exclusively inhabit
   wood. On average the soil was more species-rich than the decaying wood,
   but the species richness in dead wood increased monotonically along the
   decay gradient, reaching the same species richness and community
   composition as soil in the late stages. Decaying logs at all decay
   stages locally influenced the fungal communities from soil, some fungal
   species occurring in soil only under decaying wood. Stable isotope
   analyses suggest that mycorrhizal species colonising dead wood in the
   late decay stages actively transfer nitrogen and carbon between soil and
   host plants. Most importantly, Piloderma sphaerosporum and Tylospora sp.
   mycorrhizal species were highly abundant in decayed wood. Soil- and

Abstract = {{For 15+ years, a beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) dominated forest on

   The results of comparative and experimental studies underpin the high

   soil to both direct climate change effects on plant physiology and
   indirect effects mediated by soil biogeochemical cycles. Mechanisms
   contributing to this vulnerability at the ecosystem and organismic level

Abstract = {{Root-derived resources are receiving increased attention as basal
   resources for soil animal food webs. They predominantly function as
   carbon and energy resources for microbial metabolism in the rhizosphere,
   however, root-derived nitrogen may also be important. We explored both
   the role of root-derived carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) for the nutrition
   of soil animal species. Using C-13 and N-15 pulse labeling we followed
   in situ the flux of shoot-derived C and N into the soil animal food web
   of young beech (Fagus sylvatica) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) trees. For
   labeling with C-13, trees were exposed to increased atmospheric
   concentrations of (CO2)-C-13 and for labeling with N-15 leaves were
   immersed in a solution of (CaNO3)-N-15. Twenty days after labeling
   root-derived N was detected in each of the studied soil animal species
   whereas incorporation of root-derived C was only detected in the ash
   rhizosphere. More root-derived N was incorporated into soil animals from
   the beech as compared to the ash rhizosphere, in spite of the higher
   N-15 signatures in fine roots of ash as compared to beech. The results
   suggest that soil animal food webs not only rely on root C but also on
   root N with the contribution of root N to soil animal nutrition varying
   with tree species. This novel pathway of plant N highlights the
   importance of root-derived resources for soil animal food webs. (C) 2017

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Deadwood is an important legacy structure in managed forests, providing
   continuity in shelter and resource availability for many organisms and
   acting as a vehicle by which nutrients can be passed from one stand to
   the next following a harvest. Despite existing at the interface between
   below- and above-ground systems, however, much remains unknown about the
   role woody debris plays in linking these zones. Moreover, it remains
   untested whether the accelerative effects of wood-feeding insects on
   wood decomposition influence tree growth or nutritional status in
   forests. In this study, we added different quantities of pine logs to
   the bases of saplings in two-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.)
   plantations in Mississippi, USA. We included a treatment in which
   subterranean termites (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae: Reticulitermes) were
   excluded from logs to determine how these insects affect the release of
   nutrients from wood and, in turn, tree growth. After 51 months of
   decomposition, we quantified below-ground effects by measuring microbial
   biomass, plant-available forms of N, and ectomycorrhizal diversity
   associated with fine tree roots. Meanwhile, above-ground measurements
   focused on the elemental concentrations in decomposing wood either
   protected or unprotected from termites and tree metrics related to
   growth and nutrient status. We found additions of wood to significantly
   increase nitrate and potential net nitrification relative to reference
   treatments but detected no significant effects on tree growth, needle
   nitrogen concentrations, or ectomycorrhizal diversity. Soil nitrate and
   potential net nitrification were higher under protected vs. unprotected
   logs, and plant-available forms of N were mostly more abundant short
   distances away from both protected and unprotected logs than directly
   under them. The wood of logs protected from termites had significantly
   lower concentrations of most elements compared to that of unprotected
   logs, largely due to the large amounts of soil imported into unprotected
   logs by termites. Termite exclusion had no measurable effect on tree
   growth, nutritional status, or ectomycorrhizal diversity, however. Our
   findings indicate that deadwood and termites both contribute to the
   spatial heterogeneity of soil properties but may have limited short-term
   local effects on tree growth. Longer-term studies and studies on less
   fertile sites are needed.}},

Abstract = {{It is increasingly recognized that microbiota affect host health and

   endophytic fungi, which make up a diverse, environmentally acquired
   fungal microbiota. Here, we experimentally manipulated assembly of the
   cacao tree (Theobroma cacao) fungal microbiome in nature and tested the
   effect of assembly outcome on host health. Using next-generation
   sequencing, as well as culture- based methods coupled with Sanger
   sequencing, we found that manipulating leaf litter exposure and location

   cacao. Exposing cacao seedlings to leaf litter from healthy conspecific
   adults enriched the seedling microbiome with Colletotrichum tropicale, a
   fungal endophyte known to enhance pathogen resistance of cacao seedlings
   by upregulating host defensive pathways. As a result, seedlings exposed
   to healthy conspecific litter experienced reduced pathogen damage. Our
   results link processes that affect the assembly and composition of

Abstract = {{Root-associated fungi, particularly ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), are
   critical symbionts of all boreal tree species. Although climatically
   driven increases in wildfire frequency and extent have been hypothesized
   to increase vegetation transitions from tundra to boreal forest, fire
   reduces mycorrhizal inoculum. Therefore, changes in mycobiont inoculum
   may potentially limit tree-seedling establishment beyond current
   treeline. We investigated whether ectomycorrhizal shrubs that resprout
   after fire support similar fungal taxa to those that associate with tree
   seedlings that establish naturally after fire. We then assessed whether
   mycobiont identity correlates with the biomass or nutrient status of
   these tree seedlings. The majority of fungal taxa observed on shrub and
   seedling root systems were EMF, with some dark septate endophytes and
   ericoid mycorrhizal taxa. Seedlings and adjacent shrubs associated with
   similar arrays of fungal taxa, and there were strong correlations
   between the structure of seedling and shrub fungal communities. These
   results show that resprouting postfire shrubs support fungal taxa
   compatible with tree seedlings that establish after wildfire. Shrub
   taxon, distance to the nearest shrub and fire severity influenced the
   similarity between seedling and shrub fungal communities. Fungal
   composition was correlated with both foliar C:N ratio and seedling
   biomass and was one of the strongest explanatory variables predicting
   seedling biomass. While correlative, these results suggest that
   mycobionts are important to nutrient acquisition and biomass accrual of
   naturally establishing tree seedlings at treeline and that mycobiont
   taxa shared by resprouting postfire vegetation may be a significant
   source of inoculum for tree-seedling establishment beyond current

Abstract = {{Human activities affect both tree species composition and diversity in
   forested ecosystems. This in turn alters the species diversity of plant
   litter and litter quality, which may have cascading effects on soil
   microbial communities and their functions for decomposition and nutrient
   cycling. We tested microbial responses to litter species diversity in a
   leaf litter decomposition experiment including monocultures, 2-, and
   4-species mixtures in the subtropical climate zone of southeastern
   China. Soil microbial community composition was assessed by lipid
   analysis, and microbial functions were measured using extracellular
   enzyme activity and gross rates of nitrogen mineralization. We observed
   a positive relationship between litter species diversity and abundances
   of mycorrhizal fungi and actinomycetes. Alternatively, enzyme activities
   involved in carbon and phosphorus acquisition, and enzyme indices of
   relative carbon limitation, were higher only in the 4-species mixtures.
   This suggests that the minimum basal substrate level for enzyme
   production was reached, or that limitation was higher, at the highest
   diversity level only. Responses to litter diversity also changed over
   time, where phosphatase responses to litter diversity were strongest
   early in decomposition and the indices of carbon limitation relative to
   other nutrients showed stronger responses later in decomposition. Enzyme
   activities were related to lipid biomarker data and the mass of litter
   remaining at the third time point, but relationships between enzyme
   activity and the mass of litter remaining were not consistent across
   other time points. We conclude that litter species richness will likely
   only reduce microbial functions at key intervals of diversity loss while
   microbial growth is more sensitive to incremental diversity loss, with
   no clear relationships between them or to ecosystem functions. The
   observed litter diversity effects on soil microbial biomass and enzyme
   activity indicate interactions of aboveground and belowground
   communities, and together with environmental conditions they are
   important for maintaining ecosystem functions.}},

Abstract = {{Documenting succession in forest canopy gaps provides insights into the

   ageing of natural canopy gaps in oak forests. In one of the last
   remaining Quercus ilex L. old-growth forests (on the island of Corsica,
   western Mediterranean basin), we systematically recorded and conducted
   molecular analyses of X. subpileatus basidiomes in 80 dated natural
   canopy gaps representing a 45-year long sequence of residence time of
   tree logs on the forest floor. Xylobolus subpileatus fruited exclusively
   on Q. ilex logs. The probability of fruiting of X. subpileatus
   significantly increases during the process of wood decomposition to
   reach its maximum in the oldest gaps, approximately 40 years after
   treefall. In contrast, the abundance and the richness of saprobic and
   ectomycorrhizal fruitbodies decrease as canopy gaps age. Our results
   emphasize the high ecological specialization of X. subpileatus. They
   also highlight the imperative need to conserve the last patches of

Abstract = {{Temperate ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi show segregation whereby some

   layering in tropical soils is hypothesized to decrease niche space and

   The Neotropical ECM tree Dicymbe corymbosa forms monodominant stands and
   has a distinct physiognomy with vertical crown development, adventitious
   roots and massive root mounds, leading to multi-stemmed trees with
   spatially segregated rooting environments: aerial litter caches, aerial
   decayed wood, organic root mounds and mineral soil. We hypothesized that
   these microhabitats host distinct fungal assemblages and therefore
   promote diversity.
   To test our hypothesis, we sampled D.corymbosa ectomycorrhizal root tips
   from the four microhabitats and analyzed community composition based on
   pyrosequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) barcode
   markers.
   Several dominant fungi were ubiquitous but analyses nonetheless
   suggested that communities in mineral soil samples were statistically

Abstract = {{Our recent studies have demonstrated that forest litter used in a
   bare-root forest nursery promoted survival and growth of two-year-old
   Scots pine seedlings and positively shaped the development of their
   ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities. To determine whether the
   beneficial effects of litter treatment can be extended to the next
   growing seasons, litter-treated seedlings were outplanted to four sites
   with different environmental conditions: forest clear-cut (S1), area
   formerly polluted by emissions from nitrogen fertilizer plant (S2),
   abandoned agricultural land (S3,) and coastal sand dunes (S4). Seedlings
   grown in mineral nursery soil without litter amendment served as
   controls. Height and survival of seedlings were measured over three
   consecutive years after outplanting. At the end of the third growing
   season, the mycorrhizal status of seedlings was assessed using DNA-based
   identification techniques. Litter treatment during the nursery phase
   significantly improved the height of seedlings at the end of the first
   growing season at all tested sites. In the second and third growing
   seasons after outplanting, the heights of litter treated seedlings
   remained greater compared to control seedlings at three of the four
   sites; however, at the abandoned agricultural site (S3), significantly
   lower growth of litter-treated seedlings was observed. After the third
   growing season, the differences in seedling heights at the forest
   clear-cut (S1) and the site formerly polluted by nitrogen (S2) were not
   statistically significant. Survival of all outplanted seedlings varied
   by season and study site, but litter treated seedlings showed a clear
   tendency towards enhanced survival. Three years after outplanting, the
   survival rates of litter-treated seedlings ranged from approximately
   81\% at S4 to 96\% at S2; for control seedlings, survival rates ranged
   from 63\% at S4 to 81\% at S3. At sites S1, S2 and S4, the survival of
   litter-treated seedling was significantly higher.
   There was a substantial transformation in ECM community composition with
   low persistence of suilloid mycorrhizas for both litter-treated and
   control seedlings three years after outplanting. Two-way analysis of
   similarities (ANOSIM) indicated that differences in ECM fungal community
   composition across seedlings from different sites likely were due to
   site specificity rather than previous litter treatment.
   Our results indicated that nursery soil amended with pine forest litter
   creates favourable conditions for the production of pine seedlings with
   better root quality and high abundance of suilloid mycorrhizas, thus
   allowing for potential reductions in mortality after outplanting on
   unfavourable sites. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   S. kurilensis strongly affected soil properties, including total carbon,
   total nitrogen, nitrate, and the C:N ratio as well as relative soil
   moisture. Marked differences were also noted in fungal and bacterial
   communities between plots. The relative abundance of the fungal phylum
   Ascomycota was 13.9\% in the Sasa-intact plot and only 0.54\% in the

   abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher, whereas those of
   Planctomycetes and Actinobacteria were lower in the Sasa-intact plot

Abstract = {{Bacterial communities and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) co-occur in
   the soil, however, the interaction between these two groups during
   litter decomposition remains largely unexplored. In order to investigate
   the effect of AMF on soil bacterial communities, we designed dual
   compartment microcosms, where AMF (Funneliformis mosseae) was allowed
   access (AM) to, or excluded (NM) from, a compartment containing forest
   soil and litterbags. Soil samples from this compartment were analyzed at
   0, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days. For each sample, Illumina sequencing was
   used to assess any changes in the soil bacterial communities. We found
   that most of the obtained operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from both
   treatments belonged to the phylum of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and
   Actinobacteria. The community composition of bacteria at phylum and
   class levels was slightly influenced by both time and AMF. In addition,
   time and AMF significantly affected bacterial genera (e.g., Candidatus
   Solibacter, Dyella, Phenylobacterium) involved in litter decomposition.
   Opposite to the bacterial community composition, we found that overall
   soil bacterial OTU richness and diversity are relatively stable and were
   not significantly influenced by either time or AMF inoculation. OTU
   richness at phylum and class levels also showed consistent results with
   overall bacterial OTU richness. Our study provides new insight into the

Abstract = {{Fine-root traits mediate the capacity of plants to acquire soil
   resources in different environments. This study aimed to examine the
   changes of fine-root traits when roots proliferate into the litter layer
   vs. mineral soils, and to determine fine-root trait plasticity of these
   roots in response to nitrogen (N) addition.
   A one-year N addition experiment was conducted in a 22-year-old
   broadleaf Mytilaria laosensis (Hamamelidaceae) plantation in subtropical
   China. Newly produced fine roots were collected monthly from the litter
   layer and upper mineral soil (0-10 cm) layer to measure root
   morphological traits and nutrient concentrations. Fine-root production
   was determined using ingrowth mesh screens in the litter layer.
   Fine-root production in the litter layer in the Mytilaria laosensis
   plantation was 2.6 g m(-2) yr.(-1) but increased 3- to 5-fold with N
   addition. Significant differences in fine-root morphological traits and
   nutrient concentrations were found between the litter layer and 0-10 cm
   mineral soil layer. Fine roots in the litter layer were thinner, with
   higher specific root length (SRL), higher specific root area (SRA), a
   higher proportion of fine-root biomass in lower, more absorptive root
   orders, and lower root tissue density (RTD) than those in 0-10 cm
   mineral soil layer. Higher carbon (C), N, phosphorus (P), potassium (K),
   calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) concentrations and lower C:N ratio (C/N)
   were also observed in fine roots in the litter layer, compared to the
   0-10 cm mineral soil layer. Nitrogen addition significantly increased
   root P, K, and Ca concentrations, but had no effect on Mg concentration.
   Nitrogen addition did not affect most fine-root morphological traits but
   did result in decreased root diameter.
   Compared with the mineral soil, roots produced in the litter layer
   generally reflected a more absorptive strategy with smaller root
   diameter and lower RTD and with higher SRL, SRA, and nutrient
   concentrations which together are generally associated with more
   metabolically active, but shorter lived roots. Strong responses of
   fine-root production and nutrient concentrations to N addition also
   suggest that N may be a driving factor for fine-root growth into the
   litter layer. Further studies are required to identify the effect of
   fine-root growth into the litter layer on microbial activity.}},

Abstract = {{Most land plants acquire nitrogen (N) through associations with

   employ contrasting strategies for N acquisition, which may lead to
   different stocks of soil carbon (C). We experimentally test this
   hypothesis with a mesocosm system where AM and ECM tree seedling roots,
   or their hyphae only, could access mineral soils with C-13- and
   N-15-enriched organic matter. We quantified loss of soil C and N, plant
   uptake of N and new inputs of plant C to soil. We found that AM, but not
   ECM, seedlings reduced soil C relative to controls. Soil C loss was
   greater in the presence of roots relative to hyphae only for both AM and
   ECM seedlings, but was correlated with plant N uptake for AM seedlings
   only. While new plant C inputs stimulated soil C loss in both symbioses,
   we detected plant C inputs more frequently and measured higher rates of
   decomposer activity in soils colonized by AM relative to ECM seedlings.
   Our study experimentally demonstrates how mycorrhizal strategies for N
   can affect soil C and C: N, even at the scale of an individual plant.
   Such effects may contribute to broad patterns in soil C across

   Southern Urals. Rare and dominant operational taxonomic units' (OTU)
   role in contamination-induced community transformation was assessed
   using Hill profiles and abundance-weighted multivariate analysis of
   variance. In contaminated sites, OTU loss represented 3-19\% of each
   group, with Acidobacteria exhibiting the lowest amount of OTU loss.
   Acidobacteria in spruce-fir forests, along with Actinobacteria and
   Eumycota in both forest types, exhibited a significant alpha-diversity
   decrease. Two taxon- and forest type-specific patterns in the spatial
   distribution transformation were observed in the contaminated sites:
   increased beta-diversity, which is attributable to differences in the
   number of OTUs between local assemblages; and decreased spatial
   variation of dominants. Despite a high proportion of shared OTUs
   (54-76\%), community differentiation between contaminated and control
   sites was significant in all groups, primarily due to dominant OTUs in
   Actinobacteria and rare OTUs in the other target groups. Despite a lack
   of herbaceous vegetation in the contaminated sites, the least effect of
   contamination on community diversity and structure was evident in
   Glomeromycota. Microbial biomass in contaminated forest litter was three
   to five times lower than in the control areas, though only slight

Abstract = {{Microbial activity in forest soils is driven by the dynamics of
   ecosystem processes, largely dependent on trees as the major primary
   producers. Diurnal variation of root activity, seasonality of
   photosynthate production or recalcitrance of decomposing plant biomass
   all affect microbial abundance, composition of their communities and
   activity. Due to low N content, fungi appear to be the major decomposers
   of complex plant biomass: litter and deadwood and to largely shape
   associated bacterial communities and their activity. On the other hand,
   bacteria are important in decomposition of fungal mycelia and N-cycle
   processes including N-fixation. Microbial activity is also affected in
   the short term by climatic events and in the long-term by ecosystem

Abstract = {{The ecology of forest soils is an important field of research due to the
   role of forests as carbon sinks. Consequently, a significant amount of
   information has been accumulated concerning their ecology, especially
   for temperate and boreal forests. Although most studies have focused on
   fungi, forest soil bacteria also play important roles in this
   environment. In forest soils, bacteria inhabit multiple habitats with
   specific properties, including bulk soil, rhizosphere, litter, and
   deadwood habitats, where their communities are shaped by nutrient
   availability and biotic interactions. Bacteria contribute to a range of
   essential soil processes involved in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen,
   and phosphorus. They take part in the decomposition of dead plant
   biomass and are highly important for the decomposition of dead fungal
   mycelia. In rhizospheres of forest trees, bacteria interact with plant
   roots and mycorrhizal fungi as commensalists or mycorrhiza helpers.
   Bacteria also mediate multiple critical steps in the nitrogen cycle,
   including N fixation. Bacterial communities in forest soils respond to
   the effects of global change, such as climate warming, increased levels
   of carbon dioxide, or anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. This response,
   however, often reflects the specificities of each studied forest
   ecosystem, and it is still impossible to fully incorporate bacteria into
   predictive models. The understanding of bacterial ecology in forest
   soils has advanced dramatically in recent years, but it is still
   incomplete. The exact extent of the contribution of bacteria to forest
   ecosystem processes will be recognized only in the future, when the
   activities of all soil community members are studied simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesized that dinitrogen (N-2)- and non-N-2-fixing tropical trees
   would have distinct phosphorus (P) acquisition strategies allowing them
   to exploit different P sources, reducing competition.
   We measured root phosphatase activity and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)
   colonization among two N-2- and two non-N-2-fixing seedlings, and grew
   them alone and in competition with different inorganic and organic P
   forms to assess potential P partitioning.
   We found an inverse relationship between root phosphatase activity and
   AM colonization in field-collected seedlings, indicative of a trade-off
   in P acquisition strategies. This correlated with the predominantly
   exploited P sources in the seedling experiment: the N-2 fixer with high
   N-2 fixation and root phosphatase activity grew best on organic P,
   whereas the poor N-2 fixer and the two non-N-2 fixers with high AM
   colonization grew best on inorganic P. When grown in competition,
   however, AM colonization, root phosphatase activity and N-2 fixation
   increased in the N-2 fixers, allowing them to outcompete the non-N-2
   fixers regardless of P source.
   Our results indicate that some tropical trees have the capacity to
   partition soil P, but this does not eliminate interspecific competition.
   Rather, enhanced P and N acquisition strategies may increase the
   competitive ability of N-2 fixers relative to non-N-2 fixers.}},

Abstract = {{The fine roots of trees may show plastic responses to their resource
   environment. Several, contrasting hypotheses exist on this plasticity,
   but empirical evidence for these hypotheses is scattered. This study
   aims to enhance our understanding of tree root plasticity by examining
   intra-specific variation in fine-root mass and morphology, fine-root
   growth and decomposition, and associated mycorrhizal interactions in
   beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests
   on soils that differ in resource availability.
   We measured the mass and morphological traits of fine roots (i.e. <= 2
   mm diameter) sampled to 50 cm depth. Fine-root growth was measured with
   ingrowth cores, and fine-root decomposition with litter bags.
   Mycorrhizal fungal biomass was determined using ingrowth mesh bags.
   Both tree species showed more than three times higher fine-root mass,
   and a ten-fold higher fine-root growth rate on sand than on clay, but no
   or marginal differences in overall fine-root morphology. Within the
   fine-root category however, beech stands had relatively more root length
   of their finest roots on clay than on sand. In the spruce stands,
   ectomycorrhizal mycelium biomass was larger on sand than on clay.
   In temperate beech and spruce forests, fine-root mass and mycorrhizal
   fungal biomass, rather than fine-root morphology, are changed to ensure
   uptake under different soil resource conditions. Yet enhancing our
   mechanistic understanding of fine-root trait plasticity and how it
   affects tree growth requires more attention to fine-root dynamics, the
   functional diversity within the fine-roots, and mycorrhizal symbiosis as
   an important belowground uptake strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Land management practices considerably influence ecosystem processes and
   functioning, particularly in dryland ecosystems where nutrient and water
   limitations have direct (via effects on productivity) and indirect (via
   effects on soil biota) effects on ecosystem properties. Fungi in soils
   and associated with roots play critical roles in soil nutrient cycling
   and plant nutrient acquisition, but their responses to land management
   practices in dryland ecosystems remain equivocal. Here we evaluate the
   responses of fungal communities in roots and soils associated with a
   Eucalyptus saligna plantation after six years of forest management
   practices (irrigation and fertilisation) and in two different
   microenvironments within treated plots, in the presence and absence of
   understorey grasses. We observed that the richness and evenness of
   fungal communities were higher in soil than in root samples, but these
   two parameters did not vary among any of the management treatments.
   Effects of fertilisation and irrigation on fungal community composition
   were observed and appeared to be related to variation in soil pH,
   moisture, and nitrogen availability. Both fertilisation and irrigation
   decreased the ratios of ectomycorrhizal fungi to total fungi and
   increased the frequencies of saprotrophic and/or plant pathogenic fungi.
   We observed that some OTUs were shared between soil and root-associated
   fungal communities but that fertilisation was associated with lower
   frequencies of shared OTUs, suggesting a decoupling of these
   communities. In the absence of grasses, where only tree roots were
   present, we observed fewer tight relationships between fungal occurrence
   in root and soil samples. Our findings highlight the importance of
   forest management practices for fungal community assembly processes in
   dryland ecosystems, which may have consequences for the predictability
   of fungal community dynamics and nutrient cycling. (C) 2017 Published by

Abstract = {{Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) is known as an important microbial
   by-product which is crucial for preserving or accumulating soil organic

   GRSP and its relationship with SOC using C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) in three tropical forests. The three forests, including a planted
   forest (PF), a secondary forest (MF) and a primary forest (BF), were
   selected to represent the natural successional process after disturbance
   in southern China. Results showed that the average concentrations of
   GRSP were (3.94 +/- 1.09) mg cm(-3) and accounting for (3.38 +/- 1.15)\%
   of the SOC in the top 10 cm soil. NMR analysis indicated rich aromatic C
   (similar to 30\%) and carboxyl C (similar to 40\%) in GRSP, and abundant
   alkyl C (similar to 30\%) and O-alkyl C (similar to 50\%) in SOC. The
   recalcitrance indexes (RI), as defined as the ratio of sum of alkyl C

Abstract = {{Peatlands encode information about past vegetation dynamics, climate,
   and microbial processes. Here, we used delta N-15 and delta C-13
   patterns from 16 peat profiles to deduce how the biogeochemistry of the
   Marcell S1 forested bog in northern Minnesota responded to environmental
   and vegetation change over the past similar to 10 000 years. In multiple
   regression analyses, delta N-15 and delta C-13 correlated strongly with
   depth, plot location, C/N, \%N, and each other. Correlations with \%N,
   \%C, C/N, and the other isotope accounted for 80\% of variance for delta
   N-15 and 38\% of variance for delta C-13, reflecting N and C losses. In
   contrast, correlations with depth and topography (hummock or hollow)
   reflected peatland successional history and climate. Higher delta N-15
   in plots closer to uplands may reflect upland-derived DON inputs and
   accompanying shifts in N dynamics in the lagg drainage area surrounding
   the bog. The Suess effect (declining delta(CO2)-C-13 since the
   Industrial Revolution) lowered delta C-13 in recent surficial samples.
   High delta N-15 from -35 to -55 cm probably indicated the depth of
   ectomycorrhizal activity after tree colonization of the peatland over
   the last 400 years, as confirmed by the occasional presence of wood down
   to -35 cm depth. High delta C-13 at similar to 4000 years BP (-65 to
   -105 cm) could reflect a transition at that time to slower rates of peat
   accumulation, when C-13 discrimination during peat decomposition may
   increase in importance. Low delta C-13 and high delta N-15 at -213 and
   -225 cm (similar to 8500 years BP) corresponded to a warm period during
   a sedge-dominated rich fen stage. The above processes appear to be the
   primary drivers of the observed isotopic patterns, whereas there was no
   clear evidence for methane dynamics influencing delta C-13 patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of plant litter traits and decomposability for nutrient
   cycling processes and plant community dynamics through plant-litter-soil
   feedbacks has been largely emphasized. However, the role of biotic
   interactions as drivers of intraspecific variability in litter traits
   remains surprisingly little studied. In this study, we used a
   large-scale, multi-site network of long-term tree removal experiments
   manipulating the abundance of a foundation tree species, i.e., Quercus
   petraea, to assess how plant interactions control intraspecific
   variation in oak leaf litter traits and decomposability. We studied 19
   plots across eight experimental sites covering a large gradient of oak
   abundance, stand age, and local abiotic context. Oak leaf litter quality
   strongly declined with tree removal in early forest successional stage.
   Litter became poorer in nutrients such as N and Mg and richer in
   secondary metabolites such as lignin and condensed tannins. This in turn
   slowed its decomposition. Importantly, litter N loss switched from N
   release to N immobilization. Variance partitioning indicated that oak
   abundance explained as much variation in oak leaf litter traits as oak
   age and twice as much as soil inherent fertility. Confirmatory path
   analysis revealed that the decline of oak leaf litter quality induced by
   tree removal was most likely driven by a shift in understory plant
   species composition. Plasticity of oak leaf litter traits to the
   shortage of nutrient supply related to the development of understory
   plants competitors with higher nutrient capture and retention ability
   could potentially explain this response pattern. Our data also give
   consistent but weaker support that the decline of oak leaf litter
   quality could be driven by alleviated competition for light among canopy
   trees and subsequent enhanced crown exposure to light. Overall, our
   study provides evidence that biotic factors such as plant interactions
   are major drivers of plasticity in leaf litter traits and
   decomposability. This finding contributes to the emerging view that
   phenotypic -plasticity is fundamentally related to biotic interactions
   for sessile organisms, especially for long-lived and large plant species
   such as trees. Taking this source of functional diversity into account
   could help us to better understand plant community dynamics and
   ecological processes in terrestrial ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) availability influences the productivity and distribution
   of plants in tropical montane forests. Strategies to acquire soil N,
   such as direct uptake of organic compounds or associations with root
   symbionts to enhance N acquisition in exchange for carbon (C), may
   facilitate plant species coexistence and ecosystem N retention.
   Alternatively, rapid microbial turnover of soil N forms in tropical
   soils might promote flexible plant N-uptake strategies and mediate
   species coexistence. We tested whether sympatric plant species with
   different root symbiont associations, and therefore potentially
   different nutrient acquisition strategies, partition chemical forms of N
   or show plasticity in N uptake in a tropical pre-montane forest in
   Panama. We traced the movement of three N-15 forms into soil pools,
   microbes, and seedlings of eleven species differing in root traits.
   Seedlings were grown in a split-plot field transplant experiment, with
   plots receiving equimolar mixtures of ammonium, nitrate, and glycine,
   with one form isotopically labeled in each block. After 48 h, more N-15
   was recovered in microbes than in plants, while all pools (extractable
   organic and inorganic N, microbial biomass, and leaves) contained
   greater amounts of N-15 from nitrate than from ammonium or glycine.
   Furthermore, C-13 from dual-labeled glycine was not recovered in the
   leaves of any seedling, suggesting the studied species do not directly
   take up organic N or transform organic N prior to translocation to
   leaves. Nitrogen uptake differed by root symbiont group only for
   nitrate, with greater N-15 recovery in plants with arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) associations or proteoid roots compared to orchids.
   Some root trait groups differed in N-15 recovery among N forms, with
   greater nitrate uptake than ammonium or glycine by Lambda M-associated
   and N-2-fixing plants. However, only five of eleven species showed
   differences in uptake among N forms. These results indicate flexibility
   in uptake of N forms in tropical plants across root trait groups, with
   only a few species displaying weak preferences for a specific N form.}},

   ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented
   within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British
   Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors,
   responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral
   and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation.
   2. The grass Milium effusum is a common species of mature woodland in
   central and southern England, but is less common in the wetter parts of
   northern England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Worldwide, the species is
   native to many temperate, boreal, subarctic and subalpine parts of the
   northern hemisphere: from eastern North America across most of Europe
   (excluding Mediterranean climates) to the Ural Mountains and Black Sea,
   extending eastwards to the Himalaya, Korea and Japan.
   3. Wood Millet is a shade-tolerant, relatively tall grass (up to 1.8 m)
   producing up to 700 caryopses per individual. It is characteristic of
   temperate deciduous woodland, but can also occur in other woodland and
   forest types and even in scrub, alpine meadows, along railways and
   roads, and on rocks. In woods, it is one of the most conspicuous plants
   of the herb layer in the early summer after the disappearance of spring
   flowering species. While the species is generally considered an ancient
   woodland indicator in England and western Europe, it is also known to
   colonize secondary, post-agricultural forests relatively rapidly in
   other areas such as Denmark, southern Sweden and Poland.
   4. The species has a wide amplitude in terms of soil acidity and
   nutrient availability, but predominantly grows on soils of intermediate
   soil fertility and soil pH and with high organic matter concentration.
   However, M. effusum can tolerate large quantities of tree-leaf litter on
   the forest floor and is able to grow on very acidic soils.
   5. Changes in land use, climate, densities of large herbivores and
   atmospheric deposition of nitrogen are having effects on populations of
   Wood Millet. Significant responses of the life-history traits and
   population characteristics have been detected in response to
   environmental variation and to experimental treatments of temperature,
   nutrients, light and acidity. In many of its habitats across its range,
   M. effusum is currently becoming more frequent. During the last century,
   its mean elevation of occurrence in upland areas of Europe has also
   increased by several hundreds of metres. Typically, management actions
   are directed towards the conservation of its main habitat type (e.g.
   ancient woodlands of the Milio-Fagetum association) rather than to the
   species specifically.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Temperate deciduous forest understoreys are
   experiencing widespread changes in community composition, concurrent
   with increases in rates of nitrogen supply. These shifts in plant
   abundance may be driven by interspecific differences in nutrient
   foraging (i.e. conservative vs. acquisitive strategies) and, thus,
   adaptation to contemporary nutrient loading conditions. This study
   sought to determine if interspecific differences in nutrient foraging
   could help explain patterns of shrub success and decline in eastern
   North American forests.
   Methods Using plants grown in a common garden, fine root traits
   associated with nutrient foraging were measured for six shrub species.
   Traits included the mean and skewness of the root diameter distribution,
   specific root length (SRL), C:N ratio, root tissue density, arbuscular
   mycorrhizal colonization and foraging precision. Above- and below-ground
   productivity were also determined for the same plants, and population
   growth rates were estimated using data from a long-term study of
   community dynamics. Root traits were compared among species and
   associations among root traits, measures of productivity and rates of
   population growth were evaluated.
   Key Results Species fell into groups having thick or thin root forms,
   which correspond to conservative vs. acquisitive nutrient foraging
   strategies. Interspecific variation in root morphology and tissue
   construction correlated with measures of productivity and rates of cover
   expansion. Of the four species with acquisitive traits, three were
   introduced species that have become invasive in recent decades, and the
   fourth was a weedy native. In contrast, the two species with
   conservative traits were historically dominant shrubs that have declined
   in abundance in eastern North American forests.
   Conclusions In forest understoreys of eastern North America, elevated
   nutrient availability may impose a filter on species success in addition
   to above-ground processes such as herbivory and overstorey canopy
   conditions. Shrubs that have root traits associated with rapid uptake of
   soil nutrients may be more likely to increase in abundance, while
   species without such traits may be less likely to keep pace with more
   productive species.}},

Abstract = {{As the number of drought occurrences has been predicted to increase with
   increasing temperatures, it is believed that boreal forests will become
   particularly vulnerable to decreased growth and increased tree mortality
   caused by the hydraulic failure, carbon starvation and vulnerability to
   pests following these. Although drought-affected trees are known to have
   stunted growth, as well as increased allocation of carbon to roots,
   still not enough is known about the ways in which trees can acclimate to
   drought. We studied how drought stress affects belowground and
   aboveground carbon dynamics, as well as nitrogen uptake, in Scots pine
   (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings exposed to prolonged drought. Overall 40
   Scots pine seedlings were divided into control and drought treatments
   over two growing seasons. Seedlings were pulse-labelled with (CO2)-C-13
   and litter bags containing N-15-labelled root biomass, and these were
   used to follow nutrient uptake of trees. We determined photosynthesis,
   biomass distribution, root and rhizosphere respiration, water potential,
   leaf osmolalities and carbon and nitrogen assimilation patterns in both
   treatments. The photosynthetic rate of the drought-induced seedlings did
   not decrease compared to the control group, the maximum leaf specific
   photosynthetic rate being 0.058 and 0.045 mu mol g(-1) s(-1) for the
   drought and control treatments, respectively. The effects of drought
   were, however, observed as lower water potentials, increased
   osmolalities as well as decreased growth and greater fine root-to-shoot
   ratio in the drought-treated seedlings. We also observed improved uptake
   of labelled nitrogen from soil to needles in the drought-treated
   seedlings. The results indicate acclimation of seedlings to long-term
   drought by aiming to retain sufficient water uptake with adequate
   allocation to roots and root-associated mycorrhizal fungi. The plants
   seem to control water potential with osmolysis, for which sufficient
   photosynthetic capability is needed.}},

Abstract = {{In seasonally dry environments such as the Zagros woodlands (Iran),
   severe drought stress and lack of appropriate management practices can
   cause failure of oak afforestation or reforestation. We investigated the
   effect of soil properties and burial depth on Persian oak (Quercus
   brantii Lindl.) establishment in different microhabitats resulting from
   traditional forest practices. Four microhabitats that were based on
   forest structure were considered for oak acorn seeding: (1) inside old
   sprout clumps (ISPC); (2) under the canopy of tall trees (UCTT); (3)
   outside the canopy of tall trees and sprout clumps; and (4) near recent
   stumps or sprout clumps. Acorns were seeded at two depths (2 and 5 cm),
   and seedling survival and growth variables were recorded for 4 years,
   together with soil chemical and biological attributes. Stepwise
   discriminant analysis showed that a combination of total soil nitrogen,
   cation exchange capacity, available phosphorus and potassium, litter
   depth, microbial quotient, metabolic coefficient, substrate-induced
   respiration and earthworm abundance was the best variables to
   characterise the microhabitats. With the exception of pH, bulk density
   and soil texture, these variables were higher in UCTT and ISPC than in
   the other microhabitats. Seedling emergence and survival were greater at
   a seed depth of 5 cm than at 2 cm. Seedling height and shoot, root and
   leaf biomasses were higher in the UCTT microhabitat compared to the
   other microhabitats and correlated positively with soil nutrients
   contents and most of the soil biological variables but negatively with
   soil bulk density. This study emphasised the role of microhabitats in
   creating a ``canopy effect{''} producing favourable physical, chemical
   and biological soil conditions. In particular, large oak trees form
   islands of fertility and therefore are of key importance for successful
   seedling establishment in forests subjected to intense human activities.}},

Abstract = {{Fine roots (<= 2 mm in diameter) of tree species, traditionally regarded
   as homogenous entities, are expected to be major contributors of forest
   soil organic carbon (C), but their contributions need to be reevaluated
   given the heterogeneity in many root characteristics within fine-root
   architecture. Here, literature data were synthesized to analyze whether
   there existed heterogeneity of decomposition rates within fine-root
   architecture of tree species and quantify the relative contributions of
   roots of each branching order to forest soil C storage by combining
   variations in annual litter inputs among fine-root branching
   hierarchies. Results showed the presence of heterogeneity in
   decomposition rates within fine-root architecture, and this pattern was
   influenced by classification methods (root order or diameter class).
   Specifically, the heterogeneity in decomposition rates was shown only
   when fine roots were classified by root order, but not when fine roots
   were classified by diameter class. The slower decomposition rates of
   lower-order roots (the first two orders) were related to their higher
   acid-unhydrolyzable residues. Furthermore, lower-order roots were found
   to account for 57-71\% of annual root litter inputs of the first five
   orders. Given the slow decomposition rates and high annual litter inputs
   of lower-order roots of tree species, our findings suggest that
   lower-order roots should be important contributors to forest soil

Abstract = {{Experiments with plant species that can host both arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are important to separating
   the roles of fungal type and plant species and understanding the

   acquisition. We examined the effects of mycorrhizal fungal type on the
   growth and tissue nutrient content of two tree species (Eucalyptus
   grandis and Quercus costaricensis) grown under four nutrient treatments
   (combinations of low versus high nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) with
   different N:P ratios) in the greenhouse. Trees were inoculated with
   unidentified field mixtures of AMF or EMF species cultivated on root
   fragments of AMF- or EMF-specific bait plants. In E. grandis,
   inoculation with both AMF and EMF positively affected belowground plant
   dry weight and negatively affected aboveground dry weight, while only
   inoculation with AMF increased tissue nutrient content. Conversely, Q.
   costaricensis dry weight and nutrient content did not differ

   dependence on cotyledon reserves for growth. Mineral nutrition of both
   tree species differed with the ratio of N to P applied while growth did
   not. Our results demonstrate that both tree species' characteristics and
   the soil nutrient environment can affect how AMF and EMF interact with

Abstract = {{Boreal forest floor emits biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs)
   from the understorey vegetation and the heterogeneous soil matrix, where
   the interactions of soil organisms and soil chemistry are complex.
   Earlier studies have focused on determining the net exchange of VOCs
   from the forest floor. This study goes one step further, with the aim of
   separately determining whether the photosynthesized carbon allocation to
   soil affects the isoprenoid production by different soil organisms,
   i.e., decomposers, mycorrhizal fungi, and roots. In each treatment,
   photosynthesized carbon allocation through roots for decomposers and
   mycorrhizal fungi was controlled by either preventing root ingrowth (50
   mu m mesh size) or the ingrowth of roots and fungi (1 mu m mesh) into
   the soil volume, which is called the trenching approach. Isoprenoid
   fluxes were measured using dynamic (steady-state flow-through) chambers
   from the different treatments. This study aimed to analyze how important
   the understorey vegetation is as a VOC sink. Finally, a statistical
   model was constructed based on prevailing temperature, seasonality,
   trenching treatments, understory vegetation cover, above canopy
   photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil water content, and soil
   temperature to estimate isoprenoid fluxes. The final model included
   parameters with a statistically significant effect on the isoprenoid
   fluxes. The results show that the boreal forest floor emits
   monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and isoprene. Monoterpenes were the most
   common group of emitted isoprenoids, and the average flux from the
   non-trenched forest floor was 23 mu gm(-2) h(-1). The results also show
   that different biological factors, including litterfall, carbon
   availability, biological activity in the soil, and physico-chemical
   processes, such as volatilization and absorption to the surfaces, are
   important at various times of the year. This study also discovered that
   understorey vegetation is a strong sink of monoterpenes. The statistical
   model, based on prevailing temperature, seasonality, vegetation effect,
   and the interaction of these parameters, explained 43\% of the
   monoterpene fluxes, and 34-46\% of individual alpha pinene, camphene,
   beta-pinene, and Delta(3)-carene fluxes.}},

Abstract = {{In response to increasing timber demands, extensive areas of secondary
   forests have been converted to larch (Larix gmelinii) plantations in
   northeast China. It has been reported that the conversions have led to
   reduction in soil organic matter and nutrient availability. Soil
   microbes play crucial roles in nutrient cycling. However, the effects of
   forest conversion on soil microbes are not yet well understood in
   temperate forest ecosystems. In this study, the structure and function
   of bacterial and fungal communities were compared lietween larch
   plantations and adjacent secondary forests relative to surface litter
   and two soil layers (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) using Illumina MiSeq
   sequencing. We found that the impacts of the forest conversion on soil
   microbes mainly occurred in the top (0-10 cm) soil layer. Soils in
   secondary forests were associated with a higher proportion of
   copiotrophic bacteria (Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria). In contrast,
   larch plantation soil was enriched with Acidobacteria, which are
   oligotrophs that appear to be well suited to acidic conditions. These
   differences in soil bacterial communities confirm that the forest
   conversion resulted in soil acidification and a large decline in
   available soil nutrient in larch plantations. Furthermore, the results
   of bacterial functional genes, inferred by PICRUSt, and the results of
   extracellular enzyme assays indicate that fungi likely dominated soil
   organic carbon decomposition in forest soils. Sordariomycetes was the
   most abundant fungal class in soils of secondary forests. The abundance
   of Sordariomycetes fungi was related to higher levels of almost all
   enzymes measured, except for cellobiohydrolase and
   beta-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosamidase. These two enzymes were positively
   associated with Agaricomycetes fungi in soils of secondary forests. The
   fungal community in the soils of larch plantations was dominated by the
   class Agaricomycetes, which was positively associated with activities of
   both hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes. These results indicate that
   fungal classes, Sordariomycetes and Agaricomycetes, are most likely
   responsible for the decomposition of soil organic matter in secondary
   forests, while Agaricomycetes fungi might be more important in
   controlling decomposition in larch plantations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Globally, forests represent highly productive ecosystems that act as
   carbon sinks where soil organic matter is formed from residuals after
   biomass decomposition as well as from rhizodeposited carbon. Forests
   exhibit a high level of spatial heterogeneity and the importance of
   trees, the dominant primary producers, for their structure and
   functioning. Fungi, bacteria and archaea inhabit various forest
   habitats: foliage, the wood of living trees, the bark surface, ground
   vegetation, roots and the rhizosphere, litter, soil, deadwood, rock
   surfaces, invertebrates, wetlands or the atmosphere, each of which has
   its own specific features, such as nutrient availability or temporal
   dynamicy and specific drivers that affect microbial abundance, the level
   of dominance of bacteria or fungi as well as the composition of their
   communities. However, several microorganisms, and in particular fungi,
   inhabit or even connect multiple habitats, and most ecosystem processes
   affect multiple habitats. Forests are dynamic on a broad temporal scale
   with processes ranging from short-term events over seasonal ecosystem
   dynamics to long-term stand development after disturbances such as fires
   or insect outbreaks. The understanding of these processes can be only
   achieved by the exploration of the complex `ecosystem microbiome' and

Abstract = {{Leaf litter chemistry and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are key drivers of
   the below-ground nitrogen (N) cycling within forest ecosystems. Their
   combined effects on litter decomposition and N competition between
   microbial decomposers and plants are still uncertain.
   We conducted a glasshouse microcosm experiment with low or high
   ECM-colonized beech (Fagus sylvatica) saplings, growing with litter
   collected from old or young beech trees growing on the same loamy soil.
   After 6months of growth, we investigated litter decomposition rates,
   microbial respiration and the N pools within leaf litter, soil
   (different pools), microbial and plant shoot biomass.
   We found that the mass loss of the litter from young trees was always
   higher than the litter from the mature trees. The microbial biomass N
   per unit soil carbon was low when the litter, especially from mature
   trees, was added, suggesting that the litter provided recalcitrant
   compounds and limited soil microbial activity. In contrast to the Gadgil
   effect' hypothesis, the high ECM-colonized roots increased the litter
   decomposition rate and N immobilization in poorly decomposable litter in
   comparison with the litter incubated with the low ECM-colonized roots.
   Finally, the high ECM-colonized plants that received the poorly
   decomposable leaf litter exhibited the highest shoot N amount and
   biomass and were associated with the lowest microbial biomass N.
   Two-way anovas revealed that litter and ECM fungi occurrence together
   impacted final particulate organic N, microbial biomass N, the amount of
   shoot N and shoot biomass. Four N pools are key drivers of microbial
   biomass N and shoot N: particulate organic N, total N, soil ammonium
   concentration and litter N concentration.
   Synthesis. Our results support the hypothesis that poorly decomposable
   leaf litter produced by mature beech trees and ECM fungi together
   decrease microbial N immobilization but increase tree N acquisition.
   Increasing N retention within the recalcitrant N forms in soil was
   identified as a key mechanism by which beech alters soil N cycling with
   potential positive feedbacks on its acquisition by the plant. Our result
   emphasizes the importance of considering within-species litter-trait
   variability in litter decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is a growing amount of evidence that arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) influence the decomposition process, the extent
   of their involvement remains unclear. Therefore, given this knowledge
   gap, our aim was to test how AMF influence the soil decomposer
   communities. Dual compartment microcosms, where AMF (Glomus mosseae)
   were either allowed access (AM+) to or excluded (AM-) from forest soil
   compartments containing litterbags (leaf litter from Calophyllum
   polyanthum) were used. The experiment ran for six months, with
   destructive harvests at 0, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days. For each harvest
   we measured AMF colonization, soil nutrients, litter mass loss, and
   microbial biomass (using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA)). AMF
   significantly enhanced litter decomposition in the first 5 months,
   whilst delaying the development of total microbial biomass (represented
   by total PLFA) from T-150 to T-180. A significant decline in soil
   available N was observed through the course of the experiment for both
   treatments. This study shows that AMF have the capacity to interact with
   soil microbial communities and inhibit the development of fungal and

Abstract = {{We investigated consequences of plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) in a
   tropical montane forest on Mt. Kinabalu in Borneo by measurements of
   light and soil conditions, ecophysiological analyses of tree seedlings,
   a long-term adult and seedling census, and a simple simulation model.
   The study plot (2.74 ha) is in a mixed conifer-broadleaf forest with
   24\% relative basal area of conifers. First, we investigated light and
   soil conditions beneath two dominant species, a conifer Dacrydium
   gracilis (Podocarpaceae, arbuscular mycorrhizal tree) and a broadleaf
   Lithocaprus clementianus (Fagaceae, ectomycorrhizal tree). The relative
   light intensity was marginally higher beneath Dacrydium tree crown than
   beneath Lithocarpus tree crown. The concentrations of inorganic nitrogen
   and labile phosphorus, and the nitrogen mineralization rate, were lower
   beneath Dacrydiumd than beneath Lithocarpus, suggesting that soils
   -beneath Dacrydium were more nutrient deficient. Microscopic
   observations confirmed that conifer seedlings (including Dacrydium)
   harbored arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In addition, a molecular analysis
   showed that root-associated mycorrhizal fungal communities were clearly
   different between conifer and broadleaf seedlings, and consequently,
   nutrient acquisition -capacity of seedlings may be different between
   them. Indeed, stable isotopic evidence suggested that Dacrydium
   seedlings are more efficient in inorganic nitrogen acquisition than
   Lithocarpus seedlings. These results predicted that the conifer
   seedlings would out-compete broadleaf seedlings and have a greater
   advantage beneath the conifer canopy. To test the possible advantage of
   conifer seedlings in performance, we developed hierarchical Bayesian
   models and estimated growth and mortality rates using the seedling
   census data during 2006-2012. We found that conifer seedlings performed
   better than broadleaf seedlings beneath Dacrydium canopy. On the other
   hand, broadleaf seedlings performed better than conifer seedlings
   beneath Lithocarpus canopy. The consequences of the PSFs for the tree
   community composition were investigated by developing a simple
   simulation model, and were compared with the results of a model without
   PSFs. After a 10 000-year simulation, the relative abundance of conifers
   with PSFs converged to 22\%, which was consistent with the actual
   abundance; the model without effects of PSFs predicted a relative
   abundance of only similar to 10\%. The results suggested that PSFs
   contributed to the maintenance of the conifer dominance in the tropical
   montane forest.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{The impact of atmospheric nitrogen deposition on forest ecosystems
   depends in large part on its fate. Past tracer studies show that litter
   and soils dominate the short-term fate of added N-15, yet few have
   examined its longer term dynamics or differences among forest types.
   This study examined the fate of a N-15- tracer over 5-6years in a mixed
   deciduous stand that was evenly composed of trees with ectomycorrhizal
   and arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. The tracer was expected to
   slowly mineralize from its main initial fate in litter and surface soil,
   with some N-15 moving to trees, some to deeper soil, and some net
   losses. Recovery of added N-15 in trees and litterfall totaled 11.3\%
   both 1 and 5-6years after the tracer addition, as N-15 redistributed
   from fine and especially coarse roots into cumulative litterfall and
   small accumulations in woody tissues. Estimates of potential carbon
   sequestration from tree N-15 recovery amounted to 12-14kg C per kg of N
   deposition. Tree N-15 acquisition occurred within the first year after
   the tracer addition, with no subsequent additional net transfer of N-15
   from detrital to plant pools. In both years, ectomycorrhizal trees
   gained 50\% more of the tracer than did trees with arbuscular
   mycorrhizae. Much of the N-15 recovered in wood occurred in tree rings
   formed prior to the N-15 addition, demonstrating the mobility of N in
   wood. Tracer recovery rapidly decreased over time in surface litter
   material and accumulated in both shallow and deep soil, perhaps through
   mixing by earthworms. Overall, results showed redistribution of tracer
   N-15 through trees and surface soils without any losses, as
   whole-ecosystem recovery remained constant between 1 and 5-6years at
   70\% of the N-15 addition. These results demonstrate the persistent
   ecosystem retention of N deposition even as it redistributes, without
   additional plant uptake over this timescale.}},

   fine root dynamics and production of extramatrical mycorrhizal mycelia
   (EMM) along four elevational transects reaching from the closed forest
   to the treeless tundra. In addition, we analysed elevational differences
   in climate and vegetation structure, and excavated trees to estimate
   related changes in the partitioning between below- and aboveground
   biomass. Fine root biomass of trees (< 2 mm) increased by 13-79\% with
   elevation, paralleled by a 35-72\% increase in ground vegetation fine
   roots from the closed forest to the tundra. During the first year of
   decomposition, mass loss of fine root litter from different vegetation
   types was greater at lower elevations in the forest-tundra ecotone. The
   ratio between fine roots of trees and stem biomass largely increased
   with elevation in both regions, but these increases were not accompanied
   by a distinct production of EMM. Production of EMM, however, increased
   with the presence of ectomycorrhizal trees at the transition from the
   tundra to the forest. Our results imply that the recorded upward
   expansion of forest into former tundra in the Ural Mountains by 4-8 m
   per decade is decreasing the partitioning of plant biomass to fine
   roots. They further suggest that climate-driven forest advances will
   alter EMM production rates with potential feedbacks on soil carbon and

Abstract = {{The patterns of the distribution of fungal species and their potential

   endomycorrhizal trees. Our hypothesis was that tree species shape the

   diversity of fungal communities in these two compartments is partly
   dependent on the coverage of trees in the Neotropical rainforest. In
   French Guiana, a long-term plantation and a natural forest were selected

   Significant spatial heterogeneity in the fungal communities was found
   without strong variation in the species richness and evenness among the

Abstract = {{1. Microbial respiration in dead wood contributes substantially to the
   long-lived forest carbon (C) pool and has a significant role in the
   forest nitrogen (N) cycle. Wood N content has been found to increase
   during the decay process; however, temporal dynamics and the sources of
   this external N remain unclear.
   2. To examine N dynamics at various stages of decomposition, we combined
   high variety of analytical methods on Norway spruce logs, including wood
   d 15 N, N\%, C-14-dating, fungal composition and N-2 fixation rate. For
   N-2 fixation rate, we also determined its dependency on ambient
   temperature and decay class, when estimating annual N-2 fixation rates
   for our study site.
   3. N-2 fixation was observed to have a major role in increasing wood N
   content during decay. For the most decayed wood, it accounted for 60\%
   of the total N accumulation. Compared to other reports, where the annual

   of 85 g N ha(-1) year(-1) is a low estimate. However, previous studies
   have not taken appropriately into account the dependency of N-2 fixation

   external N and their relative significance. All of these factors are
   important for nitrogen as well as carbon models dealing with ecosystem

Abstract = {{Compared with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) forests, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)
   forests are hypothesized to have higher carbon (C) cycling rates and a
   more open nitrogen (N) cycle. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized
   645 observations, including 22 variables related to below-ground C and N
   dynamics from 100 sites, where AM and ECM forests co-occurred at the
   same site. Leaf litter quality was lower in ECM than in AM trees,
   leading to greater forest floor C stocks in ECM forests. By contrast, AM
   forests had significantly higher mineral soil C concentrations, and this
   result was strongly mediated by plant traits and climate. No significant
   differences were found between AM and ECM forests in C fluxes and labile
   C concentrations. Furthermore, inorganic N concentrations, net N
   mineralization and nitrification rates were all higher in AM than in ECM
   forests, indicating mineral' N economy in AM but organic' N economy in
   ECM trees. AM and ECM forests show systematic differences in mineral vs
   organic N cycling, and thus mycorrhizal type may be useful in predicting
   how different tree species respond to multiple environmental change
   factors. By contrast, mycorrhizal type alone cannot reliably predict
   below-ground C dynamics without considering plant traits and climate.}},

Abstract = {{Tree growth in boreal forests is limited by nitrogen (N) availability.
   Most boreal forest trees form symbiotic associations with
   ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which improve the uptake of inorganic N and
   also have the capacity to decompose soil organic matter (SOM) and to
   mobilize organic N (ECM decomposition'). To study the effects of ECM
   decomposition' on ecosystem carbon (C) and N balances, we performed a
   sensitivity analysis on a model of C and N flows between plants, SOM,
   saprotrophs, ECM fungi, and inorganic N stores. The analysis indicates
   that C and N balances were sensitive to model parameters regulating ECM
   biomass and decomposition. Under low N availability, the optimal C
   allocation to ECM fungi, above which the symbiosis switches from
   mutualism to parasitism, increases with increasing relative involvement
   of ECM fungi in SOM decomposition. Under low N conditions, increased ECM
   organic N mining promotes tree growth but decreases soil C storage,
   leading to a negative correlation between C stores above- and
   below-ground. The interplay between plant production and soil C storage
   is sensitive to the partitioning of decomposition between ECM fungi and
   saprotrophs. Better understanding of interactions between functional
   guilds of soil fungi may significantly improve predictions of ecosystem
   responses to environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) anchors global terrestrial productivity and
   food and fiber supply. SOM retains water and soil nutrients and stores
   more global carbon than do plants and the atmosphere combined. SOM is
   also decomposed by microbes, returning CO2, a greenhouse gas, to the
   atmosphere. Unfortunately, soil carbon stocks have been widely lost or
   degraded through land use changes and unsustainable forest and
   agricultural practices. To understand its structure and function and to
   maintain and restore SOM, we need a better appreciation of soil organic
   carbon (SOC) saturation capacity and the retention of above-and
   belowground inputs in SOM. Our analysis suggests root inputs are
   approximately five times more likely than an equivalent mass of
   aboveground litter to be stabilized as SOM. Microbes, particularly fungi
   and bacteria, and soil faunal food webs strongly influence SOM
   decomposition at shallower depths, whereas mineral associations drive
   stabilization at depths greater than similar to 30 cm. Global
   uncertainties in the amounts and locations of SOM include the extent of
   wetland, peatland, and permafrost systems and factors that constrain
   soil depths, such as shallow bedrock. In consideration of these
   uncertainties, we estimate global SOC stocks at depths of 2 and 3 m to
   be between 2,270 and 2,770 Pg, respectively, but could be as much as 700
   Pg smaller. Sedimentary deposits deeper than 3 m likely contain >500 Pg
   of additional SOC. Soils hold the largest biogeochemically active
   terrestrial carbon pool on Earth and are critical for stabilizing
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Nonetheless, global pressures on soils
   continue from changes in land management, including the need for
   increasing bioenergy and food production.}},

Abstract = {{Decomposition subsystems have an essential role in forest dynamics but
   few studies demonstrate the effect of microbial decay traits on seedling
   regeneration. In the present study, we focused on seedling regeneration
   on coarse woody material (CWM), which is an important regeneration site

   fungal decay preference for wood structural components on seedling
   colonization. Effects of log properties including wood decay type and

   ordination methods and generalized linear models. In total, 22 woody
   species were recorded as seedlings on Pinus densiflora logs. By
   ordination analysis, white rot in heartwood and brown rot in sapwood, as
   well as canopy openness and log diameter, showed significant association
   with seedling communities. The factors selected for a generalized linear
   model for explaining seedling densities of the two dominant seedling
   species Cryptomeria japonica and P. densiflora included brown rot in
   sapwood and white rot in heartwood, but the effects were different: a
   positive effect of brown rot on C. japonica and a negative effect of
   white rot on P. densiflora. These results suggested that wood decay type

Abstract = {{Saprotrophic fungi are the primary decomposers of plant litter in

   with reduced fungal biomass, shifts in fungal community structure,
   slowed litter decay, and soil C accumulation. Although rarely studied, N
   deposition may also result in novel selective pressures on fungi,
   affecting evolutionary trajectories. To directly test if long-term N
   enrichment reshapes fungal responses to N, we isolated decomposer fungi
   from a long-term (28 yr) N-addition experiment and used a common garden
   approach to compare growth rates and decay abilities of isolates from
   control and N-amended plots. Both growth and decay were significantly
   altered by long-term exposure to N enrichment. Changes in growth rates
   were idiosyncratic, as different species grew either more quickly or
   more slowly after exposure to N, but litter decay by N isolates was
   consistent and generally lower compared to control isolates of the same
   species, a response not readily reversed when N isolates were grown in

Abstract = {{Soils are complex ecosystems in which fungi and bacteria co-exist and

   use fungal hyphae to disperse in soils. Despite the fact that fungal
   highways have been studied in laboratory models, the diversity of fungi

   highway columns containing two different culture media were used as a
   selective method to study the identity of fungi and bacteria able to

   confirm the importance of bacteria affiliated to Burkholderia as

Abstract = {{Biomass allocation to fine roots often increases under soil nutrient
   deficiency, but the fine root biomass does not often increase in old
   stands, even under nutrient limitation. Therefore, in old stands, the
   morphology, anatomy, branching architecture and mycorrhization of fine
   roots may compensate efficiently for nutrient acquisition by the low
   fine root biomass. In this study, changes in the morphology, anatomy and
   arbuscular mycorrhizal infection at each branching position of fine root
   clusters were evaluated in relation to stand age. A chronosequence (6-90
   years of age) of stands in a Cryptomeria japonica D. Don plantation was
   used for these analyses. The fine root size parameters, such as length,
   weight and tip numbers of fine root clusters, increased with stand age.
   The specific root tip length (SRTL) decreased with increasing stand age,
   suggesting that the allocation to root active portions decreased with
   stand age. From the anatomical observation, the ephemeral root tips
   increased with stand age, suggesting that root tip turnover within a
   root cluster was high in old stands. The proportions of proto-xylem
   groups among branching positions indicated that the life cycles in
   branching hierarchy should be clearer in old stands than that in younger
   stands. The increasing in the mycorrhizal infection of root tips in old
   stands should enhance the root tip absorptive functions. The SRTL was
   correlated with the wood/needle ratio, suggesting that carbon limitation
   as the stand ages may result in decline of carbon allocation to maintain
   active root tips. However, increasing of the ephemeral tips and
   mycorrhizal infection rates may compensate the declines of tip
   allocation in old stands.}},

Abstract = {{The neodymium isotope ratios (Nd-143/Nd-144) and rare earth element
   compositions of eight plant species in a well-studied Ca-depleted
   research forest (the Strengbach catchment) were measured. The
   Nd-143/Nd-144 ratios distributed between the higher ratio of apatite and
   the lower ratio of plagioclase. The ratio correlated well with the type
   of infected fungi. Ectomycorrhizae (EM)-infected plants tended to show
   lower isotope ratios than Ect-uninfected plants. This is supported by
   the REE abundance patterns: higher Nd-143/Nd-144 plants tend to show a
   more negative Eu anomaly. Based on the reported soil profile, the Nd
   isotope ratio of the surface soil is considered to be influenced
   significantly by Nd in plant litter. Combining Nd isotope and Eu anomaly
   data, the REE cycle in the catchment can largely be understood by mixing
   three endmembers of Ca-bearing plagioclase, apatite and carbonate in
   loess. EM-infected plants are estimated to incorporate 50-70\% of Nd
   ultimately from plagioclase, whereas for non EM-infected plants, less
   than 30\% of Nd is from plagioclase, perhaps indirectly from the
   recycled pool. Comparison of the results with reported mineral soil
   profiles and REE composition of acid leachates of soil indicates that
   plagioclase is dissolved by the symbiotic action of ectomycorrhizae,
   providing a direct evidence of active plant-induced weathering in a
   natural system. It is likely that plants dissolve plagioclase to

Abstract = {{The neutral monosaccharide composition of forest soils differs from that

   fungal sclerotia to determine what part it might play in the origin of
   forest soil polysaccarides. Sclerotial grain (SG) was collected from the
   O, A1 and A2 horizons of a soil of subalpine forest of Mt. Ontake,
   central Japan. Neutral saccharides in soil and SG were analyzed by two
   step hydrolysis with sulfuric acid and gas-chromatography of alditol
   acetate derivatives. Saccharides accounted for 6.0-16\% of the SG by
   carbon content. The SG contained predominantly easily hydrolysable
   (EH)-glucose, which accounted for 75-85\% of the composition depending
   on grain size and the soil horizon, followed by mannose (7.7-15\%),
   galactose (2.2-4.8\%) and non-easily hydrolysable (NEH)-glucose
   (1.7-6.1\%). The SG contained all of these sugars irrespective of its

   components found in that from the O horizon, except for fucose in that
   from A2 horizon. The monosaccharide composition of SG indicates that
   accumulation of ECM fungal sclerotial polysaccharides might have been
   responsible for enlarging the molar ratios of (galactose + mannose)
   /(arabinose + xylose) and EH-glucose/NEH-glucose of forest soils. The
   proportions of SG saccharides relative to soil saccharides were 3.6,
   1.2, and 0.83\% for the O, A1 and A2 horizons, respectively. These
   levels of the proportion are considerable as ECM fugal sclerotia are the

   Results - Seventeen AMF species (in Glomeraceae, Claroideoglomeraceae,
   Diversisporaceae, Gigasporaceae, and Acaulosporaceae) and 47 plant taxa
   (in Poaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae and fourteen other families) were
   identified. Tests determined that the factors soil P, slope, tree
   coverage, litter thickness, and soil texture affect ANT and plant
   communities. Soil physiochemical properties have an effect on AMF, plant
   diversity, and evenness diversity indices. Furthermore, there is a high
   correlation between plants and AMF diversity indices and any change in
   the plant diversity will result in AMF changes. The results also showed
   positive correlations between plant diversity and AMF diversity.
   Conclusions - AMF and plant diversity indices are highly correlated, but
   this correlation could be affected by soil physiochemical properties and
   environmental factors. Moreover, canopy coverage and litter thickness
   are considered as strongly influencing both plants and AMF.}},

Abstract = {{Monoculture rubber cultivation and its intensive associated human
   activities are known to have a negative impact on the biodiversity,
   ecology, and biological conservation of the ecosystems in which they
   occur. These negative impacts include changes to the biodiversity and
   function of soil fungal communities, which contribute towards nutrient
   cycling and interact with other organisms in belowground ecosystems, and
   may be pathogens. Despite the important role of soil fungi in rubber
   plantations, these communities have been poorly studied. In this paper,
   we review the existing literature on the diversity and ecology of
   belowground fungi in rubber plantations. Various groups of soil fungi,
   including saprobes, symbionts, and pathogens are discussed.
   Additionally, the role of plantation management is discussed in the
   context of both pathogenic soil fungi and the promotion of beneficial
   soil fungi. Management practices include clone selection, tree age and
   planting density, application of chemicals, and intercropping systems.
   Our review shows the strong need for further research into the effects
   of monoculture rubber plantations on soil fungal communities, and how we
   can best manage these systems in the future, in order to create a more
   sustainable approach to rubber production. (C) 2016 British Mycological

Abstract = {{1. Phenology-induced changes in carbon assimilation by trees may affect
   carbon stored in fine roots and as a consequence, alter carbon allocated
   to ectomycorrhizal fungi. Two competing models exist to explain carbon
   mobilization by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Under the `saprotrophy model',
   decreased allocation of carbon may induce saprotrophic behaviour in
   ectomycorrhizal fungi, resulting in the decomposition of organic matter
   to mobilize carbon. Alternatively, under the `nutrient acquisition
   model', decomposition may instead be driven by the acquisition of
   nutrients locked within soil organic matter compounds, with carbon
   mobilization a secondary process.
   2. We tested whether phenology-induced shifts in carbon reserves of fine
   roots of aspen (Populus tremuloides) affect potential activity of four
   carbon-compound degrading enzymes, beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase,
   N-acetylglucosaminidase and laccase, by ectomycorrhizal fungi.
   Ectomycorrhizal roots from mature aspen were collected across eight
   stands in north-eastern Alberta, Canada, and analysed during tree
   dormancy, leaf flush, full leaf expansion and leaf abscission. We
   predicted potential extracellular enzyme activity to be highest when
   root carbon reserves were lowest, should host phenology induce
   saprotrophism. Further, we anticipated enzyme activity to be mediated by
   invertase, a plant-derived enzyme which makes carbon available to fungal
   symbionts in the plant-fungus interface.
   3. Root carbon reserves were positively correlated with invertase,
   suggesting phenology may affect carbon allocation to ectomycorrhizal
   fungi. However, of the four enzymes, host phenology had the largest
   effect on beta-glucuronidase, but activity of this enzyme was not
   correlated with root carbon reserves or invertase. Low-biomass
   ectomycorrhizas had greater potential laccase activity than high-biomass
   ectomycorrhizas, highlighting discrete functional traits in fungi for
   litter decomposition.
   4. Our results suggest that the decomposition of organic matter may be
   driven by foraging by fungi for nutrients locked within organic
   compounds rather than for mobilizing carbon. Furthermore, the potential
   ability to degrade lignin was more common in low-biomass ectomycorrhizas
   when compared to high-biomass ectomycorrhizas.}},

   nutrient acquisition in tropical reforestation.
   Four tree species (Pinus caribaea, Quercus insignis, Swietenia

   After two years, there were strong growth differences based upon tree

   and tissue nutrient concentrations. In a complementary greenhouse
   experiment isolating fungal from tree species effects, the ratio of
   nutrients in treatments was more important to tree growth responses to
   fungal symbionts than individual nutrients.
   These results show that soil nutrient availability may be more important

Abstract = {{Swedish boreal streams were modified to transport timber by pushing
   boulders to stream sides, creating levees that disconnected streams from
   riparian areas. Many streams have since been restored and our goal was
   to understand how this affects riparian nitrogen (N) cycling.
   We compared the natural abundance of delta N-15 isotopes in foliage and
   roots of Filipendula ulmaria plus soils and litter along streams
   restored 2-25 years ago. We measured sources of N, potential
   immobilization of N, namely plant diversity and biomass, and the amount
   and sources of carbon (C) to determine if these were important for
   describing riparian N cycling.
   The delta N-15 of F. ulmaria foliage changed dramatically just after
   restoration compared to the channelized, disconnected state and then
   converged over the next 25 years with the steady-state reference.
   The disturbance and reconnection of the stream with the riparian zone
   during restoration created a short-term pulse of N availability and
   gaseous losses of N as a result of enhanced microbial processing of N.
   With increasing time since restoration, N availability appears to have
   decreased, and N sources changed to those derived from mycorrhizae,
   amino acids, or the humus layer, or there was enhanced N-use efficiency

Abstract = {{Western North American landscapes are rapidly being transformed by
   forest die-off caused by mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae),
   with implications for plant and soil communities. The mechanisms that
   drive changes in soil community structure, particularly for the highly
   prevalent ectomycorrhizal fungi in pine forests, are complex and
   intertwined. Critical to enhancing understanding will be disentangling
   the relative importance of host tree mortality from changes in soil
   chemistry following tree death.
   Here, we used a recent bark beetle outbreak in lodgepole pine (Pinus
   contorta) forests of western Canada to test whether the effects of tree
   mortality altered the richness and composition of belowground fungal
   communities, including ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi. We also
   determined the effects of environmental factors (i.e. soil nutrients,
   moisture, and phenolics) and geographical distance, both of which can
   influence the richness and composition of soil fungi.
   The richness of both groups of soil fungi declined and the overall
   composition was altered by beetle-induced tree mortality. Soil
   nutrients, soil phenolics and geographical distance influenced the
   community structure of soil fungi; however, the relative importance of
   these factors differed between ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi.
   The independent effects of tree mortality, soil phenolics and
   geographical distance influenced the community composition of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi, while the community composition of saprotrophic
   fungi was weakly but significantly correlated with the geographical
   distance of plots.
   Taken together, our results indicate that both deterministic and
   stochastic processes structure soil fungal communities following
   landscape-scale insect outbreaks and reflect the independent roles tree
   mortality, soil chemistry and geographical distance play in regulating
   the community composition of soil fungi.}},

Abstract = {{Our study used a similar to 360-year fire chronosequence in northern
   Sweden to investigate post-fire microbial community dynamics in the
   boreal bryosphere (the living and dead parts of the feather moss layer
   on the forest floor, along with the associated biota). We anticipated
   systematic changes in microbial community structure and growth strategy
   with increasing time since fire (TSF) and used amplicon pyrosequencing
   to establish microbial community structure. We also recorded edaphic
   factors (relating to pH, C and N accumulation) and the physical
   characteristics of the feather moss layer. The molecular analyses
   revealed an unexpectedly diverse microbial community. The structure of
   the community could be largely explained by just two factors, TSF and
   pH, although the importance of TSF diminished as the forest recovered
   from disturbance. The microbial communities on the youngest site (TSF =
   14 years) were clearly different from older locations (> 100 years),
   suggesting relatively rapid post-fire recovery. A shift towards
   Proteobacterial taxa on older sites, coupled with a decline in the
   relative abundance of Acidobacteria, suggested an increase in resource
   availability with TSF. Saprotrophs dominated the fungal community.
   Mycorrhizal fungi appeared to decline in abundance with TSF, possibly
   due to changing N status. Our study provided evidence for the
   decadal-scale legacy of burning, with implications for boreal forests

Abstract = {{The complex interactions between trees and soil microbes in forests as

   understood. In this study, we analyzed the effects of major European
   tree species (Fagus sylvatica L. and Picea abies (L.) Karst) on soil

   from different depths (0-10, 10-20 cm) and at different horizontal
   distances from beech or spruce trunks (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 m) in early
   summer and autumn. We assessed the composition of soil bacterial and
   fungal communities based on 16S rRNA gene and ITS DNA sequences.
   Community composition of bacteria and fungi was most strongly affected
   by soil pH and tree species. Different ectomycorrhizal fungi (e.g.,
   Tylospora) known to establish mutualistic associations with plant roots
   showed a tree species preference. Moreover, bacterial and fungal
   community composition showed spatial and seasonal shifts in soil
   surrounding beech and spruce. The relative abundance of saprotrophic
   fungi was higher at a depth of 0-10 vs. 10-20 cm depth. This was
   presumably a result of changes in nutrient availability, as litter input
   and organic carbon content decreased with soil depth. Overall bacterial
   community composition showed strong variations under spruce with
   increasing distance from the tree trunks, which might be attributed in
   part to higher fine root biomass near spruce trunks. Furthermore,
   overall bacterial community composition was strongly affected by season

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{Background. Fungal endophytes inhabit symptomless, living tissues of all
   major plant lineages to form one of earth's most prevalent groups of
   symbionts. Many reproduce from senesced and/or decomposing leaves and
   can produce extracellular leaf degrading enzymes, blurring the line
   between symbiotrophy and saprotrophy. To better understand the endophyte
   saprotroph continuum we compared fungal communities and functional
   traits of focal strains isolated from living leaves to those isolated
   from leaves after senescence and decomposition, with a focus on foliage
   of woody plants in five biogeographic provinces ranging from tundra to
   subtropical scrub forest.
   Methods. We cultured fungi from the interior of surface-sterilized
   leaves that were living at the time. of sampling (i.e., dophytes),
   leaves that were dead and were retained in plant canopies (dead leaf
   fungi,eDn LF), and fallen. leaves (leaf litter.fungi,LLF) from 3-4
   species of woody plants in each of five sites in. North America. Our
   sampling encompassed 18 plant species. representing. two families of
   Pinophyta.and five families of Angiospermae. Diversity and composition
   of fungal communities within and among leaf life stages, hosts, and
   sites were compared using ITS-partial L SU rDNA data. We evaluated
   substrate use and enzyme activity by a subset of fungi isolated'onlyfrom
   living tissues vs. fungi isolated only from non-living leaves.
   Results Across the diverse biomes and plant taxa surveyed here,
   culturable fungi living leays were isolated less frequently and were
   less diverse than those isolated from non-living leaves. Fungal
   communities in living leaves also differed detectably in composition
   from communities in dead leaves and leaf litter within focal sites and
   host taxa, regardless of differential weighting of rare and abundant
   fungi. All focal isolates grew on cellulose, lignin, and pectin as sole
   carbon sources, but none displayed igninolytic or pectinolytic activity
   in vitro. Cellulolytic activity differed among fungal classes. Within
   Dothideomycetes, activity differed significantly between fungi from
   living vs. non-living leaves, but such differences were not observed in
   Sordariomycetes.
   Discussion. Although some fungi with endophytic life stages clearly
   persist for periods of time in leaves after senescence and incorporation
   into leaf litter, our sampling across diverse biomes and host lineages
   detected consistent differences between fungal assemblages in living vs.
   non-living leaves, reflecting incursion by fungi from the leaf exterior
   after leaf death and as leaves begin to decompose. However, fungi found
   only in living leaves do not differ consistently in cellulolytic
   activity from those fungi detected thus far only in dead leaves. Future
   analyses should consider Basidiornycota in addition to the Ascomycota
   fungi evaluated here, and should explore more dimensions of functional
   traits and persistence to further define the endophytism-to-saprotrophy
   continuum.}},

   determined via Illumina sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and
   fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, and by phospholipid
   fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Functional characteristics of microbial
   communities were assessed by extracellular enzyme activity (EEA).
   Conversion to Teak plantation had no effect on species richness or
   evenness of bacterial or fungal communities, and no significant effect
   on EEA. However, multivariate analyses (nested and two-way crossed
   analysis of similarity) revealed significant effects (p < 0.05) of
   forest type (Teak vs. native) upon the composition of the microbial
   communities as reflected in all three assays of community structure.
   Univariate analysis of variance identified two bacterial phyla that were
   significantly more abundant in the native forest soils than in Teak
   soils (Cyanobacteria, p = 0.0180; Nitrospirae, p = 0.0100) and two more
   abundant in Teak soils than in native forest (candidate phyla TM7, p =
   0.0004; W56, p = 0.044). Abundance of an unidentified class of
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was significantly greater in Teak
   soils, notable because Teak is colonized by AMF rather than by
   ectomycorrihzal fungi that are symbionts of the native forest tree
   species. In conclusion, microbial diversity indices were not affected in
   the conversion of native forest to teak plantation, but examination of
   specific bacterial taxa showed that there were significant differences
   in community composition.}},

Abstract = {{Fungi are crucial to forest ecosystem function and provide important
   provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services.
   As major contributors to biomass decomposition, fungi are important to
   forest bio-geochemical cycling and maintenance of vertebrate animal
   diversity. Many forest plant species live in a symbiotic relationship
   with a fungal partner that helps a host plant to acquire nutrients and
   water. In addition, edible fungi are recreationally as well as
   economically valuable. However, most fungi live in very cryptic
   locations (e.g. in soils and interior plant tissues) and are only
   visible when their ephemeral fruiting bodies are produced, making fungal
   occurrence difficult to detect and predict. While remote sensing has
   been used increasingly to identify and scale many forest characteristics
   (e.g. structure, function, and species diversity) related to myriad
   ecosystem services, the use of remotely sensed data in modelling the
   occurrence of fungi is largely unknown. We compared the performance of
   airborne lidar derived structural variables, including those associated
   with single tree detection, with variables derived from field
   inventories to model overall fungal species abundance as well as
   specific fungal guilds (i.e. a range of edibility from highly edible to
   very poisonous, and the number of fruiting bodies of saprotrophic and
   mutualistic ectomycorrhizal species) based on fruiting body sampling in
   a low range mountain forest (Bavarian Forest National Park). Lidar
   derived variables performed better than variables derived from field
   measurements to explain the abundance of all guilds combined, as well as
   the guilds of soil saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi, and the yield
   of highly edible fungi. Variables derived from field measurements
   performed better than lidar derived variables in explaining the yield of
   very poisonous fungi. Upscaling of yield and abundance of fruiting
   bodies to the whole study area opens the avenue for managers to identify
   areas of high interest by mushroom pickers, as opposed to those of
   potential danger to people and those that co-occur with sensitive
   species and habitats of conservation relevance. Moreover, the strong,
   guild-specific relationships found between the occurrence of fungi and
   lidar derived variables opens new avenues for scaling to large areas the
   occurrence of members of this cryptic kingdom. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We conducted an experiment to investigate the potential of
   phytoremediation by soil amendments in a forest area. To desorb
   radiocesium (Cs-137) from variable charges in the soil, ammonium sulfate
   (NH4+) and elemental sulfur (S) (which decrease soil pH) were applied to
   forest soil collected from contaminated area at a rate of 40 and 80
   g/m(2), respectively. A control condition with no soil treatment was
   also considered. We defined four groups of aboveground conditions:
   planted with Quercus serrata, planted with Houttuynia cordata, covered
   with rice straw as litter, and unplanted/uncovered (control).
   Cultivation was performed in a greenhouse with a regular water supply
   for four months. Following elemental sulfur treatment, soil pH values
   were significantly lower than pH values following ammonium sulfate
   treatment and no treatment. During cultivation, several plant species
   germinated from natural seeds. No clear differences in aboveground
   tissue Cs-137 concentrations in planted Q. serrata and H. cordata were
   observed among the treatments. However, aboveground tissue Cs-137
   concentration values in the germinated plants following elemental sulfur
   treatment were higher than the values following the ammonium sulfate
   treatment and no treatment. Although biomass values for Q. serrata, H.
   cordata, and germinated plants following elemental sulfur treatment
   tended to be low, the total Cs-137 activities in the aboveground tissue
   of germinated plants were higher than those following ammonium sulfate
   treatment and no treatment in rice straw and unplanted conditions.
   Although no significant differences were observed, Cs-137 concentrations
   in rice straw following ammonium sulfate and elemental sulfur treatments
   tended to be higher than those in the control case. The results of this
   study indicate that elemental sulfur lowers the soil pH for a relatively
   long period and facilitates Cs-137 translocation to newly emerged and
   settled plants or litter, but affects plant growth in large
   concentrations and/or anaerobic conditions. Combining elemental sulfur
   application with forest management practices, such as mowing and
   thinning, could be a suitable method of decontamination of the forest
   environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microorganisms play key roles in ecosystem functioning and are
   known to be influenced by biotic and abiotic factors, such as plant
   cover or edaphic parameters. New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot
   located in the southwest Pacific, is one-third covered by ultramafic
   substrates. These types of soils are notably characterised by low
   nutrient content and high heavy metal concentrations. Ultramafic
   outcrops harbour diverse vegetation types and remarkable plant
   diversity. In this study, we aimed to assess soil bacterial and fungal
   diversity in New Caledonian ultramafic substrates and to determine
   whether floristic composition, edaphic parameters and geographical
   factors affect this microbial diversity. Therefore, four plant formation
   types at two distinct sites were studied. These formations represent
   different stages in a potential chronosequence. Soil cores, according to
   a given sampling procedure, were collected to assess microbial diversity
   using a metagenomic approach, and to characterise the physico-chemical
   parameters. A botanical inventory was also performed. Our results
   indicated that microbial richness, composition and abundance were linked
   to the plant cover type and the dominant plant species. Furthermore, a
   large proportion of Ascomycota phylum (fungi), mostly in non-rainforest
   formations, and Planctomycetes phylum (bacteria) in all formations were
   observed. Interestingly, such patterns could be indicators of past
   disturbances that occurred on different time scales. Furthermore, the
   bacteria and fungi were influenced by diverse edaphic parameters as well
   as by the interplay between these two soil communities. Another striking
   finding was the existence of a site effect. Differences in microbial
   communities between geographical locations may be explained by dispersal
   limitation in the context of the biogeographical island theory. In
   conclusion, each plant formation at each site possesses is own microbial
   community resulting from multiple interactions between abiotic and
   biotic factors.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rising temperatures enhance microbial decomposition of soil organic
   matter (SOM) and thereby increase the soil CO2 efflux. Elevated
   decomposition rates might differently affect distinct SOM pools,
   depending on their stability and accessibility. Soil fractions derived
   from density fractionation have been suggested to represent SOM pools
   with different turnover times and stability against microbial
   decomposition. To investigate the effect of soil warming on functionally
   different soil organic matter pools, we here investigated the chemical
   and isotopic composition of bulk soil and three density fractions (free
   particulate organic matter, fPOM; occluded particulate organic matter,
   oPOM; and mineral associated organic matter, MaOM) of a C-rich soil from
   a long-term warming experiment in a spruce forest in the Austrian Alps.
   At the time of sampling, the soil in this experiment had been warmed
   during the snow free period for seven consecutive years. During that
   time no thermal adaptation of the microbial community could be
   identified and CO2 release from the soil continued to be elevated by the
   warming treatment. Our results, which included organic carbon content,
   total nitrogen content, delta C-13, Delta C-14, delta N-15 and the
   chemical composition, identified by pyrolysis-GC/MS, showed no
   significant differences in bulk soil between warming treatment and
   control. Surprisingly, the differences in the three density fractions
   were mostly small and the direction of warming induced change was
   variable with fraction and soil depth. Warming led to reduced N content
   in topsoil oPOM and subsoil fPOM and to reduced relative abundance of
   N-bearing compounds in subsoil MaUM. Further, warming increased the
   delta C-13 of MaOM at both sampling depths, reduced the relative
   abundance of carbohydrates while it increased the relative abundance of
   lignins in subsoil oPOM. As the size of the functionally different SOM
   pools did not significantly change, we assume that the few and small
   modifications in SOM chemistry result from an interplay of enhanced
   microbial decomposition of SOM and increased root litter input in the
   warmed plots. Overall, stable functional SOM pool sizes indicate that
   soil warming had similarly affected easily decomposable and stabilized
   SOM of this C-rich forest soil. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Due to land use history, most of the current temperate and boreal

   examined myxomycetes in Pinus mugo plantations following a crown fire

   bore rather different myxomycete assemblages but the disparities of the
   species compositions between both burn types were more pronounced
   showing that fire severity had stronger impact on myxomycete species
   composition than the pre-fire stand type. Analysis of myxomycete
   assemblages (including the results from field collections, bark and

Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3369-3378}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystems often show differential sensitivity to chronic nitrogen (N)
   deposition; hence, a critical challenge is to improve our understanding
   of how and why site-specific factors mediate biogeochemical responses to
   N enrichment. We examined the extent to which N impacts on soil carbon
   (C) and N dynamics depend on microbial resource stoichiometry. We added
   N to forest plots dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees, which have
   litter and soil pools rich in organic N and relatively wide C:N ratios,
   and adjacent forest plots dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)
   trees, which have litter and soil pools rich in inorganic N and
   relatively narrow C:N ratios. While microbes in both plot types
   exhibited fairly strict biomass homeostasis, microbes in AM- and
   ECM-dominated plots differed in their physiological responses to N
   addition. Microbes in ECM plots responded to N enrichment by decreasing
   their investment in N-acquisition enzymes (relative to C-acquisition
   enzymes) and increasing N mineralization rates (relative to C
   mineralization rates), suggesting that N addition alleviated microbial N
   demand. In contrast, heterotrophic microbial activities in AM plots were
   unaffected by N addition, most likely as a result of N-induced increases
   in net nitrification (60\% increase relative to control plots) and
   nitrate mobilization (e.g., sixfold increases in mobilization relative
   to control plots). Combined, our findings suggest the stoichiometric
   differences between AM and ECM soils are the primary drivers of the
   observed responses. Plant and microbial communities characterized by
   wide C:N are more susceptible to N-induced changes in decomposition and
   soil C dynamics, whereas communities characterized by narrow C:N are
   more susceptible to N-induced nitrate leaching losses. Hence, the
   biogeochemical consequences of N deposition in temperate forests may be
   driven by the stoichiometry of the dominant trees and their associated
   microbes.}},

Abstract = {{1. Communities of litter saprotrophic and root-associated fungi are
   vertically separated within boreal forest soil profiles. It is unclear
   whether this depth partitioning is maintained exclusively by
   substrate-mediated niche partitioning (i.e. distinct fundamental
   niches), or by competition for space and resources (i.e. distinct
   realized niches). Improved understanding of the mechanisms driving
   spatial partitioning of these fungal guilds is critical, as they
   modulate carbon and nutrient cycling in different ways.
   2. Under field settings, we tested the effects of substrate quality and
   the local fungal species pool at various depths in determining the
   potential of saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi to colonize and exploit
   organic matter. Natural substrates of three qualities-fresh or partly
   decomposed litter or humus -were incubated in the corresponding organic
   layers of a boreal forest soil profile in a fully factorial design.
   After one and two growing seasons, fungal community composition in the
   substrates was determined by 454-pyrosequencing and decomposition was
   analyzed.
   3. Fungal community development during the course of the experiment was
   determined to similar degrees by vertical location of the substrates
   (24\% of explained variation) and by substrate quality (20\%),
   indicating that interference competition is a strong additional driver
   of the substrate-dependent depth partitioning of fungal guilds in the
   system. During the first growing season, litter substrates decomposed
   slower when colonized by root-associated communities than when colonized
   by communities of litter saprotrophs, whereas humus was only slightly
   decomposed by both fungal guilds. During the second season, certain
   basidiomycetes from both guilds were particularly efficient in
   localizing and exploiting their native organic substrates although
   displaced in the vertical profile. This validates that fungal community
   composition, rather than microclimatic factors, were responsible for
   observed depth-related differences in decomposer activities during the
   first season.
   4. In conclusion, our results suggest that saprotrophic and
   root-associated fungal guilds have overlapping fundamental niches with
   respect to colonization of substrates of different qualities, and that
   their substrate-dependent depth partitioning in soils of
   ectomycorrhiza-dominated ecosystems is reinforced by interference
   competition. Through competitive interactions, mycorrhizal fungi can
   thus indirectly regulate litter decomposition rates by restraining
   activities of more efficient litter saprotrophs.}},

Title = {{Effect of water redistribution by two distinct saprotrophic fungi on
   carbon mineralization and nitrogen translocation in dry soil}},

Volume = {{103}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hydraulic redistribution (HR) of water from wet to dry soil compartments
   by non-differentiated mycelium was recently shown for the saprotrophic
   fungus Agaricus bisporus. The redistributed water triggered the carbon
   (C) mineralization in the dry soil. The potential of other saprotrophic
   fungal species and their mycelia networks for HR in soils is unknown.
   Here, we tested the potential for HR of the mycelial cord forming
   species Schizophyllum commune, compared it to capillary water transport
   in a sandy soil and assessed the impact of HR on C mineralization and
   enzyme activities in mesocosm experiments with dry and wet soil
   compartments using labeled water (H-2) and labeled organic substrate
   (C-13, N-15). Further, we determined nitrogen (N) translocation between
   the soil compartments by the mycelium of S. commune and A. bisporus. The
   flow velocity of redistributed water in single hyphae of S. commune was
   about 0.43 cm min(-1) which is 1.5-2 times higher than in hyphae of A.
   bisporus, suggesting that cords enhance fungal HR. The amount of
   redistributed water was similar to capillary transport in the sterile
   sandy soil. Despite greater potential for HR, S. commune only slightly
   increased C mineralization and enzyme activity in the dry soil within 7
   days. S. commune translocated N towards the organic substrate in the dry
   soil and used it for hyphal growth whereas A. bisporus redistributed N
   within the mycelial network towards the wet soil. Our results suggest
   that fungal hyphae have the potential to overcome capillary barriers
   between dry and wet soil compartments via HR and that the impact of
   fungal HR on C mineralization and N translocation is related to the
   foraging strategy and the resource usage of the fungus species. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) availability restricts plant carbon assimilation from the

   covered with ericoid plants and in soil, ectomycorrhizal and ericoid
   mycorrhizal plant roots and fungal hyphae are intermixed. How different
   mycorrhizal plants affect N mobilization from soil organic matter (SOM)

   (Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis-idaea), forming
   ericoid mycorrhiza (ERM), on soil N chemistry, plant N uptake and SOM
   decomposition and compared them with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) Pinus
   sylvestris in a microcosm experiment. Pine and ericoid plants affected
   soil N similarly, accessing both degradable and recalcitrant N pools.
   Both ericoid plants and pine took up N from organic source. Ericoid
   plant roots contained more phenolic compounds and condensed tannins than
   pine roots which together with lower pH under ericoids suggests
   substantial changes in soil chemistry and biology. This study underlines
   the plant stimulation of SOM degradation with special emphasis on
   ericoid plants. We point out that both ericoid and ectomycorrhizal

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Soil fertility and topographic microclimate are
   common determinants of plant species distributions. However, biotic
   conditions also vary along these abiotic gradients, and may mediate
   their effects on plants. In this study, we investigated whether soils
   and topographic microclimate acted directly on the performance of a
   focal understorey plant, or indirectly via changing biotic conditions.
   Methods We examined direct and indirect relationships between abiotic
   variables (soil fertility and topographic microclimate) and biotic
   factors (overstorey and understorey cover, litter depth and mycorrhizal
   colonization) and the occurrence, density and flowering of a common
   understorey herb, Trientalis latifolia, in the Klamath-Siskiyou
   Mountains, Oregon, USA.
   Results We found that the positive effects of soil fertility on
   Trientalis occurrence were mediated by greater overstorey shading and
   deeper litter. However, we did not find any effects of topographic
   microclimate on Trientalis distribution that were mediated by the biotic
   variables we measured. The predictive success of Trientalis species
   distribution models with soils and topographic microclimate increased by
   12 \% with the addition of the biotic variables.
   Conclusions Our results reinforce the idea that species distributions
   are the outcome of interrelated abiotic gradients and biotic
   interactions, and suggest that biotic conditions, such as overstorey
   density, should be included in species distribution models if data are
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Fungal communities are important for carbon (C) transformations in

   dynamics in time and space. We investigated fungal diversity and
   community composition seasonally and across defined soil horizons in
   boreal Scots pine forest in Finland using 454 pyrosequencing. We
   collected a total of 120 samples from five vertical soil horizons
   monthly from March to October; in March, under snow. Boreal forest soil
   generally harbored diverse fungal communities across soil horizons. The
   communities shifted drastically and rapidly over time. In late winter,
   saprotrophs dominated the community and were replaced by ectomycorrhizal
   fungi during the growing season. Our studies are among the first to
   dissect the spatial and temporal dynamics in boreal forest ecosystems
   and highlights the ecological importance of vertically distinct
   communities and their rapid seasonal dynamics. As climate change is
   predicted to result in warmer and longer snow-free winter seasons, as
   well as increase the rooting depth of trees in boreal forest, the
   seasonal and vertical distribution of fungal communities may change.
   These changes are likely to affect the organic matter decomposition by
   the soil-inhabiting fungi and thus alter organic C pools.Fungal
   communities were diverse also in deeper soil horizons, and they varied

Abstract = {{We analyzed the dynamics of the short-term incorporation of recently
   fixed carbon into the below-ground food web in a boreal forest. Five
   young spruce trees (Picea abies) were pulse-labeled with (CO2)-C-13 and
   the isotopic label was traced in soil invertebrates during 5 weeks. The
   freshly fixed plant carbon quickly entered both litter-located and
   soil-located compartments of the detrital food web. Among invertebrates
   inhabiting the mineral soil layers, a trophic link to the root-derived C
   was most pronounced in species with higher delta N-15 values, suggesting
   this energy source to be more important in deeper mineral soil horizons.
   The label appeared faster in saprophagous animals than in predators (the
   median time lag after labeling was 6 and 12 days, respectively), but the
   difference was not significant. The label was recovered in 15 of 38
   species of saprophagous animals and in 20 of 63 species of predators.
   Among saprophages, the frequency and intensity of the label was
   relatively high in endogeic collembolans and in bibionid larvae, but
   earthworms and enchytraeids were not labeled. Several groups of
   predators, lithobiid centipedes in particular, quickly acquired the
   root-derived carbon, possibly indicating the feeding on live roots or
   mycorrhizal mycelium. In total, only 35 \% of species or genera examined
   acquired the label. This suggests that majority of invertebrate taxa in
   the decomposer food web are unlikely to depend heavily on freshly fixed
   plant carbon provided by roots and root-associated microorganisms.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue nitrogen (N) concentration has been correlated with respiration
   (RS) across plants of different life-forms, functional and phylogenetic
   groups, plant organs and ectomycorrhizae of different fungal species.
   Nothing is known, however, if a similar relationship exists in other
   organisms like fungi. Here, we explored the N-RS relationship across
   sporocarps of 93 fungal species that varied in their guilds
   (mutualistic, saprotrophic and parasitic) as well as tissue' types (caps
   and stipes). We hypothesized that RS, N and protein concentrations were
   higher for saprotrophic fungi than for either mutualistic or parasitic
   fungi and were higher for caps than for stipes. We also hypothesized
   that respiration of fungal guild could be predicted by the N
   concentration. Lastly, we predicted N and RS were phylogenetically
   conserved and that by subtracting metabolically inactive N in chitin, we
   could improve the N-RS relationship. Sporocarp N concentration only
   explained 26\% of the variation in RS across species. We found a
   significant difference in the N-RS relationship among the three fungal
   guilds, but no difference between the two tissue types. Saprotrophic
   species had higher N concentration and respiration than mutualistic and
   parasitic fungal species. Sporocarp components differed with caps
   showing both higher respiration and higher N and protein concentrations
   than stipes. Overall, our results show that fungal sporocarp nitrogen
   concentration is phylogenetically conserved among fungal families and
   may prove to be a strong predictor of fungal guild. The positive N-RS
   relationships existed for all fungal species (similar to plants), within
   fungal guilds (similar to plant functional groups), and fungal tissue'
   types (like plants' organs). The clear linkage of fungal sporocarp
   respiration to total N concentration could help improve C and N cycling
   models in forest ecosystems by including estimates of fungal respiration

Abstract = {{Organic matter decomposition is the main process by which carbon (C) is
   lost from terrestrial ecosystems, and mycorrhizal associations of plants
   (i.e. arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) and ectomycorrhizas (ECM)) may have
   different indirect effects on this loss pathway. AM and ECM plants
   differ in the soil decomposers they promote and the quality of litter
   they produce, which may result in different patterns of organic matter
   decomposition, and hence, soil C loss. To determine how mycorrhizal
   associations indirectly affect decomposer activity, we collected soils
   and litters from four AM and four ECM tree species from a
   mixed-deciduous temperate forest for a field and laboratory study. We
   first characterized insitu patterns in soil chemistry and soil microbial
   biomass among these eight tree species. We then conducted a microcosm
   experiment with mineral soils, leaf litter and fine roots originating
   from these tree species, where we reciprocally crossed litters and
   soils, and quantified the rate of heterotrophic respiration over a
   140-day laboratory incubation. In natural forest conditions, AM tree
   soils contained lower total C and microbial biomass C:N relative to ECM
   tree soils. In our microcosm experiment, AM soils supported greater
   heterotrophic respiration than did ECM soils. The addition of AM litter
   stimulated respiration more than did ECM litter, owing to the lower C:N
   of AM litter. Matching the mycorrhizal identity of litter and soil
   resulted in a difference in total respiration, such that combinations of
   AM litters with AM soils lost more C than did combinations of ECM
   litters with ECM soils.Synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that AM and
   ECM trees have differing indirect effects on soil decomposer activity
   through the decomposers they cultivate and/or the quality of organic
   matter they produce. Mycorrhizal differences in litter quality
   accentuate these effects on soil C loss and may explain patterns in soil

Abstract = {{Are mature forests carbon limited? To explore this question, we exposed
   ca. 110-year-old, 40-m tall Picea abies trees to a 550-ppm CO2
   concentration in a mixed lowland forest in NW Switzerland. The site
   receives substantial soluble nitrogen (N) via atmospheric deposition,
   and thus, trees are unlikely N-limited. We used a construction crane to
   operate the free-air CO2 release system and for canopy access. Here, we
   summarize the major results for growth and carbon (C) fluxes. Tissue
   C-13 signals confirmed the effectiveness of the CO2 enrichment system
   and permitted tracing the continuous flow of new C in trees. Tree
   responses were individually standardized by pre-treatment signals. Over
   the five experimental years, needles retained their photosynthetic
   capacity and absorbed up to 37\% more CO2 under elevated (E) compared to
   ambient (A) conditions. However, we did not detect an effect on stem
   radial growth, branch apical growth and needle litter production.
   Neither stem nor soil CO2 efflux was stimulated under elevated CO2. The
   rate at which fine roots filled soil ingrowth cores did not
   significantly differ between A- and E-trees. Since trees showed no
   stomatal responses to elevated CO2, sap flow remained unresponsive, both
   in the long run as well as during short-term CO2 on-off experiments. As
   a consequence, soil moisture remained unaffected. We trapped
   significantly more nitrate in the root sphere of E-trees suggesting a
   CO2-stimulated breakdown of soil organic matter, presumably induced by
   extra carbohydrate exudation (priming').Synthesis. The lack of a single
   enhanced C sink to match the increased C uptake meant a missing C sink.
   Increased C transport to below-ground sinks was indicated by C transfer
   to ectomycorrhiza and on to neighbouring trees and by increased C export
   to soil. We conclude that these tall Picea abies trees are not C limited
   at current CO2 concentrations and further atmospheric CO2 enrichment
   will have at most subtle effects on growth, despite enhanced N
   availability.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystems dominated by plants in symbiosis with ectomycorrhizal fungi
   store more carbon in soils. There is increasing evidence that this may
   be due to competition between primary producers and microbial
   decomposers for soil nitrogen, mediated by ectomycorrhizal fungi. This
   competitive interaction inhibits decomposition and increases soil carbon
   storage. However, other work suggests elevated carbon storage is due to
   recalcitrant plant tissue chemistry in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems,
   rather than ectomycorrhizal competition for soil nitrogen. These two
   frameworks make similar predictions for soil carbon storage, making them
   difficult to distinguish empirically. Here I argue that the
   ectomycorrhizal-recalcitrance hypothesis is not well supported by recent
   developments in the understanding of soil carbon chemistry, or
   evolutionary relationships among ectomycorrhizal plants. Therefore,
   differences in input chemistry are not sufficient to discount
   alternative mechanisms of carbon stabilization in ectomycorrhizal
   ecosystems. Future work on EM-specific stabilization of soil C should
   focus on alternative mechanisms including competition for N, direct
   antagonistic interactions, and other microbial community driven

Abstract = {{An increasing number of empirical studies are challenging the central
   fundamentals on which the classical soil food web model is built. This
   model assumes that bacteria consume labile substrates twice as fast as

   we build on emerging evidence that points to significant consumption of
   labile C by fungi, and to the ability of ectomycorrhizal fungi to
   decompose organic matter, to show that labile C constitutes a major and
   presently underrated source of C for the soil food web. We use a simple
   model describing the dynamics of a recalcitrant and a labile C pool and
   their consumption by fungi and bacteria to show that fungal and
   bacterial populations can coexist in a stable state with large inputs
   into the labile C pool and a high fungal use of labile C. We propose a
   new conceptual model for the bottom trophic level of the soil food web,
   with organic C consisting of a continuous pool rather than two or three
   distinct pools, and saprotrophic fungi using substantial amounts of

Abstract = {{Fungal community composition often shifts in response to warmer
   temperatures, which might influence decomposition of recalcitrant carbon
   ( C). We hypothesized that evolutionary trade-offs would enable
   recalcitrant C-using taxa to respond more positively to warming than
   would labile C-using taxa. Accordingly, we performed a warming
   experiment in an Alaskan boreal forest and examined changes in the
   prevalence of fungal taxa. In a complementary field trial, we
   characterized the ability of fungal taxa to use labile C ( glucose),
   intermediate C ( hemicellulose or cellulose), or recalcitrant C (
   lignin). We also assigned taxa to functional groups ( e. g., free-living
   filamentous fungi, ectomycorrhizal fungi, and yeasts) based on taxonomic
   identity. We found that response to warming varied most among taxa at
   the order level, compared to other taxonomic ranks. Among orders,
   ability to use lignin was significantly related to increases in
   prevalence in response to warming. However, the relationship was weak,
   given that lignin use explained only 9\% of the variability in warming
   responses. Functional groups also differed in warming responses.
   Specifically, free-living filamentous fungi and ectomycorrhizal fungi
   responded positively to warming, on average, but yeasts responded
   negatively. Overall, warming-induced shifts in fungal communities might
   be accompanied by an increased ability to break down recalcitrant C.
   This change in potential function may reduce soil C storage under global
   warming.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing diverse mycorrhizal fungal communities is considered
   important for forest recovery, yet mycorrhizae may have complex effects
   on tree growth depending on the composition of fungal species present.
   In an effort to understand the role of mycorrhizal fungi community in
   forest restoration in southern Costa Rica, we sampled the arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community across eight sites that were planted
   with the same species (Inga edulis, Erythrina poeppigiana, Terminalia
   amazonia, and Vochysia guatemalensis) but varied twofold to fourfold in
   overall tree growth rates. The AMF community was measured in multiple
   ways: as percent colonization of host tree roots, by DNA isolation of
   the fungal species associated with the roots, and through spore density,
   volume, and identity in both the wet and dry seasons. Consistent with
   prior tropical restoration research, the majority of fungal species
   belonged to the genus Glomus and genus Acaulospora, accounting for more
   than half of the species and relative abundance found on trees roots and
   over 95\% of spore density across all sites. Greater AMF diversity
   correlated with lower soil organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen
   concentrations and longer durations of prior pasture use across sites.
   Contrary to previous literature findings, AMF species diversity and
   spore densities were inversely related to tree growth, which may have
   arisen from trees facultatively increasing their associations with AMF
   in lower soil fertility sites. Changes to AMF community composition also
   may have led to variation in disturbance susceptibility, host tree
   nutrient acquisition, and tree growth. These results highlight the
   potential importance of fungal-tree-soil interactions in forest recovery
   and suggest that fungal community -dynamics could have important
   implications for tree growth in disturbed soils.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of long-term reforestation on soil microbial communities and

   years ago (CONIF-80). An adjacent natural broadleaf forest (BROAD-Nat)
   was used as a control. We determined microbial biomass C and N contents,
   enzyme activities, and community composition (via phospholipid fatty
   acid {[}PLFA] assessment). Both microbial biomass and PLFA content were
   higher in the summer than in the winter and differed among the forests
   in summer only. Total PLFA, total bacterial, gram-positive bacterial,
   gram-negative bacterial, and vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal
   contents followed the same pattern. Total fungal content and the ratios
   of fungi to bacteria and of gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria were
   highest in CONIF-40, with no difference between the other forests.
   Principal component analysis of PLFA contents revealed that CONIF-40

   assessed the effects of soil N amendment on fungal community structure

   following long-term N addition was offset by an increase in the relative
   abundance of saprotrophs. Species richness and diversity of

   responded positively to N enrichment. However, nitrophilic species
   included ectomycorrhizal as well as saprotrophic fungi, especially the
   ectomycorrhizal Russula vinacea, whose relative abundance increased from

   soil organic matter. The trophic niche of species varied among different
   collembolan orders and families, indicating a pronounced phylogenetic

Abstract = {{Tropical montane forests (TMF) are associated with a widely observed

   Here we emphasize that many TMFs are likely to be co-limited by multiple

Abstract = {{Our understanding of the long-lasting effects of human land use on soil
   fungal communities in tropical forests is limited. Yet, over 70\% of all
   remaining tropical forests are growing in former agricultural or logged
   areas. We investigated the relationship among land use history, biotic
   and abiotic factors, and soil fungal community composition and diversity
   in a second-growth tropical forest in Puerto Rico. We coupled
   high-throughput DNA sequencing with tree community and environmental
   data to determine whether land use history had an effect on soil fungal
   community descriptors. We also investigated the biotic and abiotic
   factors that underlie such differences and asked whether the relative
   importance of biotic (tree diversity, basal tree area, and litterfall
   biomass) and abiotic (soil type, pH, iron, and total carbon, water flow,
   and canopy openness) factors in structuring soil fungal communities
   differed according to land use history. We demonstrated long-lasting
   effects of land use history on soil fungal communities. At our research
   site, most of the explained variation in soil fungal composition (R-2 =
   18.6\%), richness (R-2 = 11.4\%), and evenness (R-2 = 10\%) was
   associated with edaphic factors. Areas previously subject to both
   logging and farming had a soil fungal community with lower beta
   diversity and greater evenness of fungal operational taxonomic units
   (OTUs) than areas subject to light logging. Yet, fungal richness was
   similar between the two areas of historical land use. Together, these
   results suggest that fungal communities in disturbed areas are more
   homogeneous and diverse than in areas subject to light logging. Edaphic
   factors were the most strongly correlated with soil fungal composition,
   especially in areas subject to light logging, where soils are more
   heterogenous. High functional tree diversity in areas subject to both
   logging and farming led to stronger correlations between biotic factors
   and fungal composition than in areas subject to light logging. In
   contrast, fungal richness and evenness were more strongly correlated
   with biotic factors in areas of light logging, suggesting that these
   metrics might reflect long-term associations in old-growth forests. The
   large amount of unexplained variance in fungal composition suggests that
   these communities are structured by both stochastic and niche assemblage
   processes.}},

   The aims of this study were to determine whether drought-induced die-off

   components and to determine the influence of climate on the soil
   respiration components. We used the mesh exclusion method to study
   seasonal variations in soil respiration (R-S) and its components:
   heterotrophic (R-H) and autotrophic (R-A) {[}further split into fine
   root (R-R) and mycorrhizal respiration (R-M)] in a mixed Mediterranean
   forest where Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is undergoing a
   drought-induced die-off and is being replaced by holm oak (Quercus ilex
   L.). Drought-induced pine die-off was not reflected in R-S nor in its
   components, which denotes a high functional resilience of the plant and
   soil system to pine die-off. However, the succession from Scots pine to
   holm oak resulted in a reduction of R-H and thus in an important
   decrease of total respiration (R-S was 36 \% lower in holm oaks than in
   non-defoliated pines). Furthermore, R-S and all its components were
   strongly regulated by soil water content-and-temperature interaction.
   Since Scots pine die-off and Quercus species colonization seems to be
   widely occurring at the driest limit of the Scots pine distribution, the
   functional resilience of the soil system over die-off and the decrease
   of R-S from Scots pine to holm oak could have direct consequences for
   the C balance of these ecosystems.}},

   forest age. Simultaneously, we decomposed three standard litter
   substrates over a 6-month period spanning an unusually intense drought.
   Decay rates of standard substrates depended on the interaction between
   litter identity and forest type. Decomposition rates were correlated
   with tree and soil fungal community composition as well as soil
   fertility, but these relationships differed among litter types. In low
   fertility soils dominated by ectomycorrhizal oak trees, bulk litter

   higher fertility soils that supported mostly arbuscular mycorrhizal
   trees, bulk litter decay rates were strongly dependent on seasonal water
   availability. Both measures of decomposition increased with forest age,

Abstract = {{Inaccurate estimate of the largest terrestrial carbon pool, soil organic
   carbon (SOC) stock, is the major source of uncertainty in simulating
   feedback of climate warming on ecosystem-atmosphere carbon dioxide
   exchange by process-based ecosystem and soil carbon models. Although the
   models need to simplify complex environmental processes of soil carbon
   sequestration, in a large mosaic of environments a missing key driver
   could lead to a modeling bias in predictions of SOC stock change.
   We aimed to evaluate SOC stock estimates of process-based models
   (Yasso07, Q, and CENTURY soil sub-model v4) against a massive Swedish
   forest soil inventory data set (3230 samples) organized by a recursive
   partitioning method into distinct soil groups with underlying SOC stock
   development linked to physicochemical conditions.
   For two-thirds of measurements all models predicted accurate SOC stock
   levels regardless of the detail of input data, e.g., whether they
   ignored or included soil properties. However, in fertile sites with high
   N deposition, high cation exchange capacity, or moderately increased
   soil water content, Yasso07 and Q models underestimated SOC stocks. In
   comparison to Yasso07 and Q, accounting for the site-specific soil
   characteristics (e. g. clay content and topsoil mineral N) by CENTURY
   improved SOC stock estimates for sites with high clay content, but not
   for sites with high N deposition.
   Our analysis suggested that the soils with poorly predicted SOC stocks,
   as characterized by the high nutrient status and well-sorted parent
   material, indeed have had other predominant drivers of SOC stabilization
   lacking in the models, presumably the mycorrhizal organic uptake and
   organo-mineral stabilization processes. Our results imply that the role
   of soil nutrient status as regulator of organic matter mineralization
   has to be re-evaluated, since correct SOC stocks are decisive for
   predicting future SOC change and soil CO2 efflux.}},

   necromass and total C were estimated by modelling. N fertilization
   reduced the standing EMM biomass C to 57\% and its production to 51\% of
   the control (from 238 to 122kgCha(-1)yr(-1)), whereas elevated CO2 had
   no detectable effects. Biomass turnover was high (13yr(-1)) and
   unchanged by the treatments. Necromass turnover was slow and was reduced
   from 1.5yr(-1) in the control to 0.65yr(-1) in the N-fertilized
   treatment. However, TOC data did not support an N effect on necromass
   turnover. An estimated EMM production ranging from 2.5 to 6\% of net
   primary production stresses the importance of its inclusion in C models.
   A slow EMM necromass turnover indicates an importance in building up
   forest humus.}},

Abstract = {{Previously extensive tracts of primary rain forest have been degraded by
   human activities, and we examined how the effects of forest disturbance
   arising from habitat fragmentation and commercial selective logging
   affected ecosystem functioning in these habitats by studying leaf litter
   decomposition rates in litter bags placed on the forest floor. The rain
   forests of Borneo are dominated by trees from the family
   Dipterocarpaceae, and we compared leaf litter decomposition rates of
   three dipterocarp species at eight forest fragment sites (area 3-3529
   ha) that had different histories of disturbance pre-fragmentation: four
   fragments had been selectively logged prior to fragmentation and four
   had been formed from previously undisturbed forest. We compared these
   logged and unlogged forest fragments with sites in continuous forest
   that had been selectively logged (two sites) and fully protected and
   undisturbed (two sites). After 120 d, undisturbed continuous forest
   sites had the fastest rates of decomposition (52\% mass loss). Forest
   fragments formed from unlogged forest (32\% mass loss) had faster
   decomposition rates than logged forest fragments (28\% mass loss), but
   slower rates than continuous logged forest (39\% mass loss). Leaves of a
   light-demanding species (Parashorea malaanonan) decomposed faster than
   those of a shade-tolerant species (Hopea nervosa), but decomposition of
   all three dipterocarp species that we studied responded similarly to
   logging and fragmentation effects. Reduced decomposition rates in logged
   and fragmented forest sites may affect nutrient cycling and thus have
   detrimental consequences for forest regeneration. Conservation
   management to improve forest quality should be a priority, particularly
   in logged forest fragments.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the nutritional strategy of true morels (genus Morchella)
   collected in 2003 and 2004 in Oregon and Alaska, 1 or 2 y after forest
   fires. We hypothesized that the patterns of stable isotopes (delta C-13
   and delta N-15) in the sporocarps would match those of saprotrophic
   fungi and that radiocarbon (Delta C-14) analyses would indicate that
   Morchella was assimilating old carbon not current-year photosynthate. We
   compared radiocarbon and stable isotopes in Morchella with values from
   concurrently collected foliage, the ectomycorrhizal Geopyxis carbonaria
   (Alb. \& Schwein.) Sacc., the saprotrophic Plicaria endocarpoides
   (Berk.) Rifai, and with literature to determine isotopic values for
   ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic fungi. Geopyxis, Plicaria and Morchella,
   respectively, were 3 parts per thousand, 5 parts per thousand and 6
   parts per thousand higher in C-13 than foliage and 5 parts per thousand,
   7 parts per thousand and 7 parts per thousand higher in N-15. High N-15
   enrichment in Morchella indicated that recent litter was not the primary
   source for Morchella nitrogen, and similar C-13 and N-15 enrichments to
   Plicaria suggest that Morchella assimilates its carbon and nitrogen from
   the same source pool as this saprotrophic fungus. From radiocarbon
   analyses Morchella averaged 11 +/- 6 y old (n = 19), Plicaria averaged
   17 +/- 5 y old (n = 3), foliage averaged 1 +/- 2 y old (n = 8) and
   Geopyxis (n = 1) resembled foliage in Delta C-14. We conclude that

Abstract = {{Clear-cutting (CC) and slash burning (SB) are common silvicultural

   examined the effects of CC and SB on soil CO2 efflux components in a
   Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook (Chinese fir, CF) plantation and a
   secondary evergreen broadleaved forest (BF) located in Fujian Province,
   southeastern China. Aboveground litter removal and root trenching were
   used to estimate CO2 fluxes from soil organic matter decomposition
   (R-SOM), litter decomposition (R-L), and autotrophic respiration by
   roots and mycorrhizae (R-R). These components were measured 5-7 times
   per month from 18 October 2001 to 25 December 2003 using soda lime
   absorption. We found that R-R, R-L and R-SOM were initially higher in CC
   and SB plots than controls in both forests, but these three component
   fluxes in disturbed plots all fell below those of the control 5-20
   months after the disturbance. Also, Q(10) values of these components
   decreased following disturbance. The annual flux of each respiration
   component was greater under BF than CF. The contribution of R-R to soil
   CO2 efflux in the control plots averaged 35\% in CF and 46\% in BF.
   R-SOM was the dominant component of soil CO2 efflux in CC and SB plots,
   accounting for over 50\%. Our results highlight the importance of
   temporal trends of the component fluxes following disturbance and

Abstract = {{Understanding the vertical distribution patterns of soil microbial
   community and its driving factors in alpine grasslands in the humid
   regions of the Tibet Plateau might be of great significance for
   predicting the soil microbial community of this type of vegetation in
   response to environmental change. Using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA),
   we investigated soil microbial community composition along an
   elevational gradient (3094 similar to 4131 m above sea level) on Mount
   Yajiageng, and we explored the impact of plant functional groups and
   soil chemistry on the soil microbial community. Except for Arbuscular
   Mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungi) biomarker 18:2 omega 6,9 increasing
   significantly, other biomarkers did not show a consistent trend with the
   elevational gradient. Microbial biomass quantified by total PLFAs did
   not show the elevational trend and had mean values ranging from 1.64 to
   4.09 mu mol per g organic carbon (OC), which had the maximum value at
   the highest site. Bacterial PLFAs exhibited a similar trend with total
   PLFAs, and its mean values ranged from 0.82 to 1.81 mu mol (g OC)(-1).
   The bacterial to fungal biomass ratios had the minimum value at the
   highest site, which might be related to temperature and soil total
   nitrogen (TN). The ratios of Gram-negative to Gram-positive bacteria had
   a significantly negative correlation with soil TN and had the maximum
   value at the highest site. Leguminous plant coverage and soil TN
   explained 58\% of the total variation in the soil microbial community
   and could achieve the same interpretation as the whole model. Other
   factors may influence the soil microbial community through interaction
   with leguminous plant coverage and soil TN. Soil chemistry and plant
   functional group composition in substantial amounts explained different
   parts of the variation within the soil microbial community, and the
   interaction between them had no impact on the soil microbial community
   maybe because long-term grazing greatly reduces litter. In sum, although
   there were obvious differences in soil microbial communities along the
   elevation gradient, there were no clear elevational trends found in
   general. Plant functional groups and soil chemistry respectively affect
   the different aspects of soil microbial community. Leguminous plant
   coverage and soil TN had important effects in shaping soil microbial
   community.}},

   community of associated microbes and enzymatic processes in this
   specific substrate were described.
   The decomposition of fungal fruiting bodies exhibited biphasic kinetics.
   The rapid initial phase, which included the disappearance of DNA, was
   followed by a slower turnover of the recalcitrant fraction. Compared
   with the surrounding litter and soil, the mycelium represented a hotspot
   of activity of several biopolymer-degrading enzymes and high bacterial
   biomass. Specific communities of bacteria and fungi were associated with
   decomposing mycelium. These communities differed between the initial and
   late phases of decomposition. The bacterial community associated with
   decomposing mycelia typically contained the genera Pedobacter,
   Pseudomonas, Variovorax, Chitinophaga, Ewingella and Stenotrophomonas,
   whereas the fungi were mostly nonbasidiomycetous r-strategists of the

Title = {{Land-use and land-cover effects on soil microbial community abundance
   and composition in headwater riparian wetlands}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{215-233}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Headwater riparian wetlands are relatively small in size but
   functionally significant as expected hot spots of microbial activity in
   the landscape. Despite their roles as biogeochemical drivers, little is
   known about how microbial communities in headwater riparian wetlands are
   affected by surrounding land-uses and land-covers (LULCs). The primary
   objective of this study was to determine if and how wetland soil
   microbial abundance and community composition varied as a function of
   landscape metrics as mediated through on-site edaphic properties.
   Forty-two soil samples, collected from eight headwater riparian wetlands
   in the Ridge and Valley Region of central Pennsylvania, were used for
   phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling of soil microbial communities.
   These samples were used to create microbial habitat models describing
   plot-level relationships between edaphic properties and microbial
   measures (i.e., microbial biomarker abundances, ratios and composition).
   Soil organic matter (SOM) content was a strong predictor of microbial
   biomarker abundances and fungi/bacteria ratios, while soil pH was a
   strong predictor of microbial composition (i.e., relative abundance of
   individual fatty acids) and potential microbial stress indices (i.e.,
   cy19:0418:1 omega 7c and cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c ratios). Soil texture,
   soil moisture, and litter total nitrogen had smaller, but significant
   effects in these empirical microbial habitat models. Microbial habitat
   models were subsequently used to estimate microbial measures for a
   larger regional headwater riparian wetland dataset (n = 87), where
   edaphic property information was compiled. Site-average microbial
   measures were correlated with wetland elevation, and with landscape
   composition metrics in a landscape assessment area (i.e., 125,664 m(2)).
   Wetland elevation explained high among-site variability in microbial
   abundance measures, as mediated through SOM content, in headwater
   riparian wetlands in forested landscapes. However, wetland elevation was
   confounded by landscape composition, for headwater riparian wetland in
   mixed forested-agricultural landscapes. Hydrology, geomorphology, and
   changes in vegetation could be used to explain SOM variation across
   wetland elevation and variability in surrounding landscape composition.
   Microbial composition measures, including the cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c ratio
   and principal component (PC) axes derived from 23 individual PLFA
   biomarkers were negatively related to the Landscape Development
   Intensity (LDI) index, and the percent area of row crops, pastures and
   grasslands, and positively related to the percent area of forest. The
   cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c ratio was positively related to the LDI index, and
   the percent area of pasture and grasslands, and negatively related to
   the percent area of forest and wetland elevation. Differences along PC
   axes were most clearly related to the relative abundances of fungal
   communities; headwater riparian wetland in forested landscapes had
   significantly higher relative abundances of saprophytic fungi
   biomarkers, while headwater riparian wetland in mixed landscapes had
   significantly higher relative abundances of the arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi biomarker. This study highlights the utility of simple landscape
   metrics, which describe wetland position and landscape composition, for
   predicting differences in edaphic variability and associated microbial
   community composition and biomass among headwater riparian wetlands at a
   regional scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to high abundance and feeding habits, invertebrates are of great

   Springtails (Collembola) that feed on fungal spores and mycelia may

   investigated by microscopy or culturing techniques, which allow identify
   only fungi that have distinctive morphological characteristics or that
   can be cultured in vitro. Here we identified the Collembola-associated
   fungi on the body surface and in the gut content using both culturing
   and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods. We studied three epigeic
   Collembola species found on the Norway spruce dominated forest stands
   throughout the vegetation period - Entomobrya nivalis, Orchesella
   flavescens and Pogonognathellus longicornis. We discovered over 1200
   fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs), i.e. the proxies for species,
   based on 97\% sequence similarity of the ITS2 subregion of ribosomal
   DNA. Most of the fungi were saprotrophs, but we detected also
   mycorrhizal, parasitic and lichenized fungi. Season was the most
   important factor affecting fungal richness and composition, especially
   on body surface. Although the data matrix revealed significant effect of
   substrate, we were unable to detect the significant fungal community
   differences between body surface and gut samples of conspecifics. There
   were no significant differences among studied epigeic Collembola species
   in the preference for fungal diet. Our study demonstrates that
   collembolans associate with a broader range of fungi than previously
   observed and thus potentially play an important role in enhancing fungal

   high-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
   region. We have also compared the fungal communities during the primary
   colonization of wood with those of the surrounding soils. A
   permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) confirmed
   that the community composition significantly differed between soil types
   (P< 0.001) and tree species (P< 0.001). The distance-based linear models
   analysis showed that environmental variables were significantly
   correlated with community structure (P< 0.04). The availability of soil
   nutrients (Ca {[}P = 0.002], Fe {[}P = 0.003], and P {[}P = 0.003])
   within the site was an important factor in the fungal community
   composition. The species richness in wood was significantly lower than
   in the corresponding soil (P< 0.004). The results of the molecular
   identification were supplemented by fruiting body surveys. Seven of the
   genera of Agaricomycotina identified in our surveys were among the top
   20 genera observed in pyrosequencing data. Our study is the first, to

   Australia biodiversity hotspot.
   3. We found greater plant species diversity across all growth forms as
   soil development proceeded and concentrations of soil nutrients,
   particularly phosphorus (P), diminished to extremely low levels (surface
   soil total P concentrations of 6 mg P kg(-1)). Despite the high plant a
   diversity on older nutrient-impoverished soils, species turnover across
   the chronosequence was exceptionally high when all growth forms were
   considered (mean of 1\% of species shared between the youngest and
   oldest soils), and there was complete turnover of woody species along
   the chronosequence. Such extreme species turnover across the
   chronosequence reflected large changes in soil chemical properties. In
   addition, b diversity within individual chronosequence stages increased
   with declining soil fertility. Shrubs remained the dominant and most
   speciose growth form throughout the chronosequence.
   4. Synthesis. The large increase in plant a diversity and the extreme
   species turnover associated with declining soil fertility highlight the
   central role of soil properties in driving plant community assembly
   during long-term ecosystem development, previously only reported from
   comparatively species-poor regions. Our finding that plant b diversity
   increased with declining soil fertility points to a novel mechanism
   whereby extremely low soil fertility, rather than high productivity,
   promotes high b diversity. These results suggest that the interaction of
   an exceptionally diverse plant species pool and nutrient-impoverished
   soils provides the basis for the maintenance of such high b diversity at
   extremely low soil fertility.}},

Abstract = {{Phyllosphere fungi show high species diversity and fulfill important
   ecological functions not only in natural forests but also in
   plantations. We sought to estimate the species diversity and community
   structure of phyllosphere fungi from tropical tree plantation plots in
   Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. We conducted a massively parallel
   amplicon sequencing analysis of fungi collected from the leaves of
   Shorea leprosula (Dipterocarpaceae), an ecologically and commercially
   important tree species. Phyllosphere fungal compositions and spatial
   variability were investigated for 31 S. leprosula trees across four
   plots within a plantation stand. In total, 488 fungal operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs) were recognized in 153,194 ribosomal internal
   transcribed spacer reads at 95\% OTU identity level. Rare OTUs accounted
   for the majority of fungal diversity detected in the study site; 200
   OTUs (41\%) comprised fewer than 10 reads and 465 OTUs (95\%) were found
   in fewer than half of the samples. Fungal OTU compositions of S.
   leprosula trees were differentiated within a narrow area of the
   plantation and even between plots that were separated by 15 m. These
   findings indicate that highly diverse fungal OTUs form spatially

Abstract = {{Cutting dry deciduous forest (preserved site) for wood supply in
   semi-arid Brazil has led to invasion of a pioneer shrub vegetation
   called ``Carrasco{''} (disturbed site), which inhibits the sprouting of
   native species. A land restoration project was undertaken in a cleared
   Carrasco area where a mixed plantation of native species and Eucalyptus
   spp. (experimental site) was established to preserve the forest and
   ensure wood supply for the local population. We considered phosphorus as
   a limiting soil nutrient to plant growth, and we addressed the roles of
   litter decomposition and microbial activity on phosphorus release in the
   disturbed, preserved and experimental sites. The phosphorus released
   from leaf litter was affected by the vegetation type, which favored
   specific soil microbial populations during decomposition. The Carrasco
   vegetation predominantly favored arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), as
   shown by root colonization in the litter bags; the Eucalyptus plants
   favored AMF and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EM), as well as phosphate
   solubilizing microorganisms (PSM), and the intercropping system favored
   AMF and PSM groups. In contrast, the preserved site favored the PSM
   population. High phosphatase activity was found in the preserved and
   experimental sites in contrast to the Carrasco soil. Principal component
   analysis showed that AMF root colonization and phosphatase activity were
   the main parameters influencing the increase in soil phosphorus. Based
   on the above results, rehabilitation appeared to be underway in the
   experimental site, since the samples were more similar to the preserved
   site than to the disturbed site. This effect was attributed to
   Eucalyptus camaldulensis that promote the establishment of all

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community composition is altered by forest
   harvesting, but it is not clear if this shift in structure influences
   ECM fungal physiological function at the community level. In this study,
   we characterized activities of extracellular enzymes in the
   ectomycorrhizospheres of Picea engelmannii seedlings grown in forest and
   clearcut plots. These exoenzymes are critical for the breakdown of large
   organic molecules, from which nutrients are subsequently absorbed and
   translocated by ECM fungi to host plants. We found that ectomycorrhizae
   on seedlings planted in forests had different exoenzyme activity
   profiles than those on seedlings planted in clearcuts. Specifically, the
   activities of glucuronidase, laccase, and acid phosphatase were higher
   on forest seedlings (P <= 0.006). These differences may have been partly
   driven by soil properties. Total carbon, total nitrogen (N), extractable
   phosphorus, extractable ammonium-N, and mineralizable N were higher,
   while pH was lower in forest plots (P <= 0.01). However, we also found
   that enzyme activity only shifted where community composition also
   changed. Functional complementarity can be inferred within ECM fungal
   communities in both forests and clearcuts because ectomycorrhizae formed
   by different species in the same environment had distinct enzyme
   profiles (P < 0.0001). However, ectomycorrhizae of Thelephora terrestris
   exhibited high levels of N- and P-mobilizing exoenzyme activities.
   Seedling biomass did not differ between forest and clearcut
   environments, so the high abundance of T. terrestris ectomycorrhizae in
   the clearcuts may have sustained nutrient acquisition by clearcut
   seedlings even in soils with lower N and P and with reduced ECM fungal

Abstract = {{Changes in soil nutrient availability during long-term ecosystem
   development influence the relative abundances of plant species with
   different nutrient-acquisition strategies. These changes in strategies
   are observed at the community level, but whether they also occur within
   individual species remains unknown. Plant species forming multiple root
   symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, ectomycorrhizal (ECM)
   fungi, and nitrogen-(N) fixing microorganisms provide valuable model
   systems to examine edaphic controls on symbioses related to nutrient
   acquisition, while simultaneously controlling for plant host identity.
   We grew two co-occurring species, Acacia rostellifera (N-2-fixing and
   dual AM and ECM symbioses) and Melaleuca systena (AM and ECM dual
   symbioses), in three soils of contrasting ages (c. 0.1, 1, and 120 ka)
   collected along a long-term dune chronosequence in southwestern
   Australia. The soils differ in the type and strength of nutrient
   limitation, with primary productivity being limited by N (0.1 ka),
   co-limited by N and phosphorus (P) (1 ka), and by P (120 ka). We
   hypothesized that (i) within-species root colonization shifts from AM to
   ECM with increasing soil age, and that (ii) nodulation declines with
   increasing soil age, reflecting the shift from N to P limitation along
   the chronosequence. In both species, we observed a shift from AM to ECM
   root colonization with increasing soil age. In addition, nodulation in
   A. rostellifera declined with increasing soil age, consistent with a
   shift from N to P limitation. Shifts from AM to ECM root colonization
   reflect strengthening P limitation and an increasing proportion of total
   soil P in organic forms in older soils. This might occur because ECM
   fungi can access organic P via extracellular phosphatases, while AM
   fungi do not use organic P. Our results show that plants can shift their
   resource allocation to different root symbionts depending on nutrient
   availability during ecosystem development.}},

   Oreomunnea reduced inorganic nitrogen availability. We found no evidence

   vs. Liquidambar formosana leaves with lower C/N and C/P ratios, with and

   in situ using the nylon net bag method in a subtropical forest. Organic
   C (OC), N, and P concentrations in decomposing litters, as well as
   litter and root masses, were measured at 3, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.
   Our results showed that the presence of roots generally increased the
   rates of mass loss, and OC, N, and P releases, and decreased the OC and
   N concentrations, but did not alter the P concentration and the C/N,
   C/P, and N/P ratios in the decomposing litters of both woody species.
   The influencing intensity of root presence was stronger on the
   decomposition of L. formosana than P. elliottii litters. Root
   proliferation percentage in decomposing litters was generally lower in
   P. elliottii than in L. formosana litters from months 1-12, but showed
   opposite trend in months 12-24. In conclusion, the interaction between

Abstract = {{Understory plant communities play critical ecological roles in forest
   ecosystems. Both above- and below-ground ecosystem properties and
   processes influence these communities but relatively little is known
   about such effects at fine (i.e., one to several meters within-stand)
   scales, particularly for forests in which the canopy is dominated by a
   single species. An improved understanding of these effects is critical
   for understanding how understory biodiversity is regulated in such
   forests and for anticipating impacts of changing disturbance regimes.
   Our primary objective was to examine the patterns of fine-scale
   variation in understory plant communities and their relationships to
   above-and below-ground resource and environmental heterogeneity within
   mature lodgepole pine forests. We assessed composition and diversity of
   understory vegetation in relation to heterogeneity of both the above
   ground (canopy tree density, canopy and tall shrub basal area and cover,
   downed wood biomass, litter cover) and below-ground (soil nutrient
   availability, decomposition, forest floor thickness, pH, and
   phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and multiple carbon-source
   substrate-induced respiration (MSIR) of the forest floor microbial
   community) environment. There was notable variation in fine-scale plant
   community composition; cluster and indicator species analyses of the 24
   most commonly occurring understory species distinguished four
   assemblages, one for which a pioneer forb species had the highest cover
   levels, and three others that were characterized by different bryophyte
   species having the highest cover. Constrained ordination (distance-based
   redundancy analysis) showed that two above-ground (mean tree diameter,
   litter cover) and eight below-ground (forest floor pH, plant available
   boron, microbial community composition and function as indicated by MSIR
   and PLFAs) properties were associated with variation in understory plant
   community composition. These results provide novel insights into the
   important ecological associations between understory plant community
   composition and heterogeneity in ecosystem properties and processes

Abstract = {{Litter decomposition is an enzymatically-complex process that is
   mediated by a diverse assemblage of saprophytic microorganisms. It is a
   globally important biogeochemical process that can be suppressed by
   anthropogenic N deposition. In a northern hardwood forest ecosystem
   located in Michigan, USA, 20 years of experimentally increased
   atmospheric N deposition has reduced forest floor decay and increased
   soil C storage. Here, we paired extracellular enzyme assays with shotgun
   metagenomics to assess if anthropogenic N deposition has altered the
   functional potential of microbial communities inhabiting decaying forest
   floor. Experimental N deposition significantly reduced the activity of
   extracellular enzymes mediating plant cell wall decay, which occurred
   concurrently with changes in the relative abundance of metagenomic
   functional gene pathways mediating the metabolism of carbohydrates,
   aromatic compounds, as well as microbial respiration. Moreover,
   experimental N deposition increased the relative abundance of 50 of the
   60 gene pathways, the majority of which were associated with
   saprotrophic bacteria. Conversely, the relative abundance and
   composition of fungal genes mediating the metabolism of plant litter was
   not affected by experimental N deposition. Future rates of atmospheric N
   deposition have favored saprotrophic soil bacteria, whereas the
   metabolic potential of saprotrophic fungi appears resilient to this
   agent of environmental change. Results presented here provide evidence
   that changes in the functional capacity of saprotrophic soil
   microorganisms mediate how anthropogenic N deposition increases C
   storage in soil.}},

Abstract = {{A chaparral and pine biosequence established in 1946 was burned in a
   wildfire in 2002. Thorough studies of the soil environments during the
   previous two decades established a baseline for comparison of post-fire
   changes. Aboveground vegetation was reduced to charred stems, and litter
   layers were combusted to white ash and charred material. Nevertheless,
   during the first year after the fire, runoff and erosion were minimal
   because biotically produced macropores maintained high infiltration
   rates. Loss of cover and plant transpiration made the soil warmer and
   moister. Combustion of organic matter mineralized constituent cations,
   increasing base cation concentrations in soil solutions and solid phases
   within the first few months after the fire. The pH, C, and N also
   increased in the soil, and the biological environment was extensively
   altered. Surface-active macrofauna increased, though seasonal patterns
   of abundance were unchanged. Post-fire fungal communities were
   distinctly different from pre-fire communities and were more similar to
   each other than were pre-fire communities. Overall, many of the wildfire
   impacts appear to be of short duration. Within 6 mo, original species
   were resprouting or emerging as seedlings, and most soil chemical,
   physical, and biological properties were either similar to pre-fire
   conditions or were rapidly returning toward them.}},

Abstract = {{In temperate and boreal forest ecosystems, nitrogen (N) limitation of
   tree metabolism is alleviated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. As forest
   soils age, the primary source of N in soil switches from inorganic (NH4
   (+) and NO3 (-)) to organic (mostly proteins). It has been hypothesized
   that ECM fungi adapt to the most common N source in their environment,
   which implies that fungi growing in older forests would have greater
   protein degradation abilities. Moreover, recent results for a model ECM
   fungal species suggest that organic N uptake requires a glucose supply.
   To test the generality of these hypotheses, we screened 55 strains of 13
   Suillus species with different ecological preferences for their in vitro
   protein degradation abilities. Suillus species preferentially occurring
   in mature forests, where soil contains more organic matter, had
   significantly higher protease activity than those from young forests
   with low-organic-matter soils or species indifferent to forest age.
   Within species, the protease activities of ecotypes from soils with high
   or low soil organic N content did not differ significantly, suggesting
   resource partitioning between mineral and organic soil layers. The
   secreted protease mixtures were strongly dominated by aspartic
   peptidases. Glucose addition had variable effects on secreted protease
   activity; in some species, it triggered activity, but in others,
   activity was repressed at high concentrations. Collectively, our results
   indicate that protease activity, a key ectomycorrhizal functional trait,
   is positively related to environmental N source availability but is also
   influenced by additional factors, such as carbon availability.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Wildfire activity is projected to increase in boreal forests as a result
   of climate warming. The consequences of increased wildfire activity for
   soil carbon (C) storage in boreal forests may depend on the sensitivity
   of soil microbes to fire severity, but microbial responses to boreal
   forest fire severity are not well known. Here, we combine remote sensing
   of fire severity and field sampling to characterize the response of soil
   microbial biomass per g soil, microbial respiration of CO2 per g soil,
   and fungal groups to fire severity in a boreal forest ecosystem. We used
   remote sensing measurements of differenced normalized burn ratio from
   Landsat as a measure of fire severity. Our results demonstrate that fire
   severity controls soil microbial responses to boreal forest fires. In
   comparison to unburned stands, burned stands had a 52\% and 56\%
   reduction in soil microbial biomass and basal respiration, respectively.
   Within burned stands, we found that microbial biomass and basal
   respiration significantly declined with increasing fire severity. In
   addition, mycorrhizal taxa and basidiomycetes displayed particularly low
   tolerances for severe fire. Although wildfires result in the immediate
   loss of soil C, our study provides evidence that decreases in microbial
   biomass and respiration following high severity fires may reduce the
   capacity of the soil microbial community to decompose soil C over longer
   time scales. Therefore, models of C cycle responses to climate warming
   may need to represent the sensitivity of microbial biomass and fungal
   community composition to fire severity in boreal forests.}},

Abstract = {{Plants typically expend a significant portion of their available carbon
   (C) on nutrient acquisition - C that could otherwise support growth.
   However, given that most global terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) do
   not include the C cost of nutrient acquisition, these models fail to
   represent current and future constraints to the land C sink. Here, we
   integrated a plant productivity-optimized nutrient acquisition model -
   the Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen Model - into one of the most widely
   used TBMs, the Community Land Model. Global plant nitrogen (N) uptake is
   dynamically simulated in the coupled model based on the C costs of N
   acquisition from mycorrhizal roots, nonmycorrhizal roots,N-fixing
   microbes, and retranslocation (from senescing leaves). We find that at
   the global scale, plants spend 2.4Pg C yr(-1) to acquire 1.0 Pg Nyr(-1),
   and that the C cost of N acquisition leads to a downregulation of global
   net primary production (NPP) by 13\%. Mycorrhizal uptake represented the
   dominant pathway by which N is acquired, accounting for similar to 66\%
   of the N uptake by plants. Notably, roots associating with arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi - generally considered for their role in
   phosphorus (P) acquisition - are estimated to be the primary source of
   global plant N uptake owing to the dominance of AM-associated plants in
   mid- and low-latitude biomes. Overall, our coupled model improves the
   representations of NPP downregulation globally and generates spatially
   explicit patterns of belowground C allocation, soil N uptake, and N
   retranslocation at the global scale. Such model improvements are
   critical for predicting how plant responses to altered N availability
   (owing to N deposition, rising atmospheric CO2, and warming
   temperatures) may impact the land C sink.}},

Abstract = {{In forest ecosystems, ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi play a
   central role in the breakdown of soil organic matter (SOM). Competition
   between these two fungal guilds has long been hypothesized to lead to

   potential mechanisms involved in the `Gadgil effect'. We find that the
   influence of ectomycorrhizal fungi on litter and SOM decomposition is
   much more variable than previously recognized. To explain the
   inconsistency in size and direction of the `Gadgil effect', weargue that
   a better understanding of underlying mechanisms is required. We discuss
   the strengths and weaknesses of each of the primary mechanisms proposed
   to date and how using different experimental methods (trenching,

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal fungi are thought to have a key role in mobilizing
   organic nitrogen that is trapped in soil organic matter (SOM). However,
   the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi decompose SOM and the
   mechanism by which they do so remain unclear, considering that they have
   lost many genes encoding lignocellulose-degrading enzymes that are
   present in their saprotrophic ancestors.
   Spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome profiling were used to examine
   the mechanisms by which five species of ectomycorrhizal fungi,
   representing at least four origins of symbiosis, decompose SOM extracted
   from forest soils.
   In the presence of glucose and when acquiring nitrogen, all species
   converted the organic matter in the SOM extract using oxidative
   mechanisms. The transcriptome expressed during oxidative decomposition
   has diverged over evolutionary time. Each species expressed a different
   set of transcripts encoding proteins associated with oxidation of
   lignocellulose by saprotrophic fungi. The decomposition `toolbox' has
   diverged through differences in the regulation of orthologous genes, the
   formation of new genes by gene duplications, and the recruitment of
   genes from diverse but functionally similar enzyme families.
   The capacity to oxidize SOM appears to be common among ectomycorrhizal
   fungi. We propose that the ancestral decay mechanisms used primarily to
   obtain carbon have been adapted in symbiosis to scavenge nutrients

Abstract = {{Symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous in tropical
   forests. AMF play a role in the forest carbon cycle because they can
   increase nutrient acquisition and biomass of host plants, but also incur
   a carbon cost to the plant. Through their interactions with their host
   plants they have the potential to affect how plants respond to
   environmental perturbation such as global warming. Our objective was to
   experimentally determine how plant respiration rates and responses to
   warmer environment are affected by AMF colonization in seedlings of five
   tropical tree species at the whole plant level. We evaluated the
   interaction between AMF colonization and temperature on plant
   respiration against four possible outcomes; acclimation does or does not
   occur regardless of AMF, or AMF can increase or decrease respiratory
   acclimation. Seedlings were inoculated with AMF spores or sterilized
   inoculum and grown at ambient or elevated nighttime temperature. We
   measured whole plant and belowground respiration rates, as well as plant
   growth and biomass allocation. There was an overall increase in whole
   plant, root, and shoot respiration rate with AMF colonization, whereas
   temperature acclimation varied among species, showing support for three
   of the four possible responses. The influence of AMF colonization on
   growth and allocation also varied among plant species. This study shows
   that the effect of AMF colonization on acclimation differs among plant
   species. Given the cosmopolitan nature of AMF and the importance of
   plant acclimation for predicting climate feedbacks a better
   understanding of the patterns and mechanisms of acclimation is essential
   for improving predictions of how climate warming may influence
   vegetation feedbacks.}},

Volume = {{93}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The turnover of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal biomass represents a
   significant input into forest carbon (C) and nutrient cycles. Given the
   size of these fluxes, understanding the factors that control the
   decomposition of this necromass will greatly improve understanding of C
   and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Recent research has highlighted the
   considerable variation in the decomposition rates of EM fungal
   necromass, and patterns from this research are beginning to emerge. In
   this article we review the research that has examined both intrinsic and
   extrinsic factors that control the decomposition of EM fungal necromass
   and propose additional factors that may strongly influence EM fungal
   necromass decomposition and ecosystem properties. We argue that, as with
   most plant litters, the stoichiometry (C:N) of EM necromass is an
   important factor governing decomposition, but its role is modulated by
   the nature of the C and N in the tissue. In particular, melanin
   concentration appears to negatively influence the quality of EM fungal
   necromass much as lignin does in plant litters. Other intrinsic factors
   such as the morphology of the mycelium may also play a large role and
   suggest this as a focus for future research. Extrinsic factors, such as
   decomposer community activity and physical protection by soil, are also
   likely to be important in governing the decomposition of ectomycorrhizal
   necromass in situ. Finally, we highlight the potential importance of EM
   fungal necromass diversity and abundance in influencing terrestrial
   biogeochemical cycles. Understanding the factors that control the
   decomposition of EM necromass will then improve the predictive power of
   next-generation terrestrial biosphere models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Vast forest areas in eastern Japan have been contaminated with
   radio-isotopes by the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP)
   accident. Radiocesium (radioCs) is known to remain bioavailable in
   forest ecosystems for a long time, and it is necessary to terminate the
   cycling process to decontaminate the forest ecosystem. We observed
   radiocesium concentrations of leaf litter during decomposition on a
   forest floor where radiocesium (Cs-137) contamination was similar to 155
   kBq/m(2). Litter bag experiments were conducted with newly fallen mixed
   deciduous leaf litter in a deciduous forest (alt. 610 m) about 50 km
   from the FDNPP. Litter bags were retrieved in April, June, August,
   October, and December 2012. Fresh litter Cs-137 concentration was
   similar to 3000 Bq/kg in December 2011. During the decomposition process
   on the forest floor, litter Cs-137 concentration increased rapidly and
   exceeded 25,000 Bq/kg after 6 months, whereas potassium (K)
   concentration in the litter was rather stable, indicating that
   radiocesium and K showed contrasting dynamics during the early
   decomposition phase. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and Cs-137 contents were
   positively correlated to fungal biomass, evaluated by phospholipid fatty
   acids in the litter during decomposition. The increase of radiocesium
   concentration mainly occurred during from April to October, when fungal
   growth peaked. Therefore, this suggests fungal translocation of
   nutrients from outside the litter substrate (immobilization) is the
   mechanism to increase radiocesium in the decomposing litter. The amount
   of Cs-137 contained in the 1-year-old decomposed leaf litter was
   estimated to be 4\% per area of the soil-contaminated Cs-137. (C) 2015

   carbon (C) and nutrient input in many forest ecosystems, studies have
   rarely examined how the process of root decomposition is affected by N

   addition on fine root (<0.5 mm diameter) decomposition using five
   substrates ranging in initial gravimetric lignin concentrations (from
   10.8\% to 34.1\%) over five years, and made a simultaneous
   characterization of effects of N on the enzymatic activity of the
   decomposer community in three temperate forests. Across substrates,
   asymptotic decomposition models best described the decomposition. The
   effects of N addition shifted over the course of fine root
   decomposition, regardless of initial lignin concentrations, with N
   speeding up the initial rate of decomposition, but ultimately resulting
   in a larger, slowly decomposing litter fraction (A). Such contrasting
   effects of N addition on initial and later stages of decomposition were
   closely linked to the dynamics of its extracellular enzyme activity. Our
   results emphasized the need for studies of N effects on litter
   decomposition that encompass the later stages of decomposition. This

Abstract = {{Saprotrophic fungi are one of the primary groups of organisms
   responsible for decomposition and nutrient cycling processes. Aside from
   their direct effects on litter decomposition, these organisms may
   indirectly affect litter invertebrate activity via fungal-mediated
   conditioning (i.e. `priming') of litter substrates. While this priming
   effect is generally assumed to take place, this assumption is based on
   correlative observations and feeding preference trials rather than
   experimental discrimination of the mechanisms driving the process. We
   used a microcosm experiment of brown-rot (Fistulina hepatica, Fomitopsis
   lilacinogilva) and white-rot (Pycnoporus coccineus) fungi on two
   sclerophyllous leaf litters (Eucalyptus loxophleba and Acacia acuminata)
   to test if a fungal-mediated change in plant litter increased the
   nutritive value of the food source, and if a change in cell-wall
   (structural) compounds reduced the toughness of leaves, resulting in
   increased feeding activity by invertebrates. Brown- and white-rot fungal
   colonization had significant and diverse effects on the total nutrient
   concentrations and proportions of cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose of
   the leaf litter fungi complex. However, significant decreases in leaf
   toughness and increases in mass loss and leaf fragmentation associated
   with detritivorous millipede (Ommatoiulus moreletii) activity only
   occurred in white-rot primed microcosms relative to the control. The
   mechanisms by which the white-rot fungus affected both leaf toughness
   and millipede feeding activity differed between leaf litters. In E.
   loxophleba microcosms, reduced leaf toughness and increased millipede
   grazing were mediated by relative changes in litter inorganic chemistry,
   rather than structural compounds, whereas in A. acuminata microcosms the
   effects of fungal priming were not mediated by either. These results
   suggest that, in the early stages of decomposition, fungal priming
   effects on leaf litter nutrients are a more important determinant of
   litter invertebrate interactions than changes to litter structural
   compounds. Furthermore, different species of fungi interact with
   different litter types and invertebrates in functionally different ways.

Journal = {{PEDOBIOLOGIA}},

Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{189-193}},
Abstract = {{Large amounts of freshly fixed carbon in forest ecosystems are allocated
   belowground and fuel soil food webs. This supply is usually generalized
   as the `root carbon', but particular pathways by which freshly fixed
   carbon is assimilated by soil animals remain poorly understood. We
   followed the appearance of the isotopic label in springtails inhabiting
   different layers of soil and litter (euedaphic, hemiedaphic and epigeic
   life forms) after in situ pulse-labelling of spruce trees with C-13-O-2.
   Isotopic label was most frequently observed in euedaphic Collembola
   (26\% of all samples), mainly in Protaphorura armata. The label was very
   rare in litter-dwelling (hemiedaphic) species (4\%). Surprisingly, the
   label was often observed in epigeic Collembola (11\%). During the period
   of 44 days after labelling, the proportion of labelled samples increased
   with time in euedaphic, but not in epigeic species, suggesting that
   freshly fixed carbon is assimilated by these collembolan groups via
   different pathways. Most likely, euedaphic species are trophically
   linked to plant roots, whereas epigeic species receive freshly fixed
   carbon from aboveground. The exact mechanisms and potential importance
   of the latter pathway should be evaluated in further research. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This study presents results of macrofungal inventory in the Western Ghat
   forest of Karnataka (reserve forest, shola forest, sacred grove and

   was found in the coffee agroforest with highest diversity, exclusive
   (confined to a specific forest: 42 sp.) and core-group (frequency of
   occurrence, >= 10\%: 17 sp.) species. Irrespective of forest, the
   species richness attained peaks during June and September. Rarefaction
   indices of species against sporocarps also showed the highest expected
   number of species in coffee agroforest. Of a total of 9256 sporocarps,
   the coffee agroforest consists of highest sporocarps than other forests
   (3715 vs. 1676. 2999). Two-way ANOVA revealed significant spatial
   difference in richness of species (P < 0.01) as well as sporocarps (P <
   0.05) without significant difference temporally. Low species similarity
   among forests surveyed (2.4. 8.5\%) depicts uniqueness of macrofungi in
   these forests. This survey yielded 45 new records to the Western Ghats
   and 47 economically valuable core-group fungi (edible, medicinal and

Abstract = {{Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi are ubiquitous in temperate and boreal
   forests, comprising over 20,000 species forming root symbiotic
   associations with Pinaceae and woody angiosperms. As much as 100
   different EM fungal species can coexist and interact with the same tree
   species, forming complex multispecies networks in soils. The degree of
   host specificity and structural properties of these interaction networks
   (e.g., nestedness and modularity) may influence plant and fungal
   community assembly and species coexistence, yet their structure has been
   little studied in northern coniferous forests, where trees depend on EM
   fungi for nutrient acquisition. We used high-throughput sequencing to
   characterize the composition and diversity of bulk soil and
   root-associated fungal communities in four co-occurring Pinaceae in a
   relic foredune plain located at Iles de la Madeleine, Quebec, Canada. We
   found high EM fungal richness across the four hosts, with a total of 200
   EM operational taxonomic units (OTUs), mainly belonging to the
   Agaricomycetes. Network analysis revealed an antinested pattern in both
   bulk soil and roots EM fungal communities. However, there was no
   detectable modularity (i.e., subgroups of interacting species) in the
   interaction networks, indicating a low level of specificity in these EM
   associations. In addition, there were no differences in EM fungal OTU
   richness or community structure among the four tree species. Limited
   shared resources and competitive exclusion typically restrict the number
   of taxa coexisting within the same niche. As such, our finding of high
   EM fungal richness and low host specificity highlights the need for
   further studies to determine the mechanisms enabling such a large number
   of EM fungal species to coexist locally on the same hosts.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) availability is expected to affect soil microbial
   community. However, our knowledge about the responses of soil microbial
   biomass and community composition to P availability is still limited. In
   this study, we established field plots with addition of 0, 5 (LP), 15
   (MP) and 30 (HP) g P m(-2) y(-1) in a subalpine spruce plantation and
   investigated the responses of soil microbes. Chloroform fumigation
   extraction and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis were used to
   determine soil microbial biomass and community composition,
   respectively. After two growing seasons of P addition, the HP treatment
   significantly increased soil microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen and P.
   The P addition exerted the specific influences on soil microbial
   community composition. The abundance of most groups of soil microbial
   community (bacteria, fungi, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) increased
   in the HP treatment and the ratio of fungi to bacteria decreased in the
   LP and MP treatment, whereas the nonmetric multidimensional scaling
   ordination revealed no significant difference in the PLFA pattern
   between the P treatments and the control. Although soil P availability
   increased in all P treatments compared to the control, the dissolved
   organic carbon, indicative of soil carbon availability, was promoted
   only by the HP treatment. Besides, soil microbial biomass was positively
   correlated to soil carbon availability and pH. These results indicate
   that soil microbes are insensitive to the elevated P availability in
   this spruce plantation and P addition increases soil microbial biomass
   mainly through improving carbon availability and pH. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{1. Fine roots and mycorrhiza often represent the largest input of carbon
   (C) into soils and are therefore of primary relevance to the soil C
   balance. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have previously been found to
   increase litter decomposition which may lead to reduced soil C stocks,
   but these studies have focused on immediate decomposition of relatively
   high amounts of high-quality litter and may therefore not hold in many
   ecological settings over longer terms.
   2. Here, we assessed the effect of mycorrhizal fungi on the fate of C
   and nitrogen (N) contained within a realistic amount of highly
   C-13-/N-15-labelled root litter in soil. This litter was either added
   fresh or after a 3-month incubation period under field conditions to a
   hyphal in-growth core where mycorrhizal abundance was either reduced or
   not through rotation. After 3 months of incubation with a plant under
   glasshouse conditions, the effect of turning cores on residual C-13 and
   N-15 inside the cores was measured, as well as C-13 incorporation in
   microbial signature fatty acids and N-15 incorporation of plants.
   3. Turning of cores increased the abundance of fungal decomposers and
   C-13 loss from cores, while N-15 content of cores and plants was
   unaffected. Despite the difference in disturbance that turning the cores
   could have caused, the results suggest that mycorrhizal fungi and field
   incubation of litter acted to additively increase the proportion of C-13
   left in cores.
   4. Synthesis. Apart from stimulating litter decomposition as previously
   shown, mycorrhizas can also stabilize C during litter decomposition and
   this effect is persistent through time.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic fires have varying effects on the oak-dominated forests of
   the Zagros Mountains in western Iran. The objective of this project was
   to investigate the effects of fire on various components of soil. For
   this purpose three homogeneous and neighboring sites were inspected.
   Site A was the unburned control. Sites B and C experienced fires about 2
   and 8 years prior to the study, respectively. In comparison to the
   control, site B showed a decline in organic matter content (1.69 +/-
   0.24 vs. 1.13 +/- 0.17), N amount (0.40 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.19 +/- 0.03),
   litter depth (1.20 +/- 0.214 cm vs. 0.087 +/- 0.044 cm), germinated
   seedlings (272 +/- 40 vs. 75 +/- 25), earthworm biomass (3.4 g/kg vs.
   0.26 g/kg), and plant diversity (1.95 +/- 0.30 vs. 1.35 +/- 0.34). An
   increase was observed for pH (7.41 +/- 0.11 vs. 7.72 +/- 0.15), Ca
   (569.09 +/- 34 vs. 855 +/- 38.17), bulk density (1.17 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.66
   +/- 0.18), the number of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) spores, and stump
   sprouting (1645 +/- 533 and 3425 +/- 491). Site C showed a similar
   decrease in organic matter content, N amount, litter depth, germinated
   seedlings, and earthworm biomass. However, plant diversity was greatly
   increased at site C, demonstrating that the conditions were better for
   plant life 8 years after the fire event. Thus, the number of germinated
   seedlings was lower than that of the control, while stump sprouting
   (4170 +/- 452 per ha) was the greatest. The AM spore count was higher at
   site B in comparison to site C, indicating that fire had caused a
   long-term loss in this essential component of the soil. An increase in
   pH was a characteristic feature of the burnt sites. Levels of
   macronutrient K were greatly increased at site C. In fact, K content was
   much higher than the other two sites (A, B, and C: 51.81 +/- 3.69, 59.75
   +/- 8.18, and 72.55 +/- 20.66, respectively), indicating that increased
   K content is a long-term effect of fire. Bulk density (1.80 +/- 0.14)
   increased at site C, which may be due to the insufficient earthworm
   biomass. Thus, 8 years were not enough to improve the soil conditions
   for soil fauna.}},

Abstract = {{Fire, besides affecting plant litter fate in natural ecosystems, is a
   widely used tool to manage crop residues in agro-ecosystems. In both
   cases, burning of plant residues produces highly heterogeneous
   materials, ranging from little affected plant tissues, to charred
   substrates, up to mineral ashes, whose chemical nature and biological
   effects are not yet fully clarified. The aim of our study was to assess
   the effects of litter treated at different temperatures (100, 200, 300,
   400 and 500 degrees C) on saprotrophic fungi, plant pathogenic microbes,
   and higher plants. To this purpose, we combined a characterization of 48
   organic materials by C-13-CPMAS NMR spectroscopy with a multi-species
   laboratory bioassay on seven target organisms (one plant and six
   microbes). Consistent with previous observations, we showed that, as
   charring temperature increased, litter quality significantly changed,
   with a progressive loss of O-alkyl C, di-O-alkyl C, and methoxyl and
   N-alkyl C, coupled with an enrichment in aromatic C, irrespective of
   plant litter types. Noteworthy, the bioassay showed that untreated
   litter had a major inhibitory effect on the test plant, while it acted
   as a suitable substrate sustaining microbial growth. On the contrary, as
   litter was charred its biochemical quality decreased with increasing
   temperature because of a progressive disappearance of easily degradable
   C sources and enrichment of recalcitrant aromatic fractions. Therefore,
   charred litter became an organic material suitable to sustain plant
   growth, but was largely inhibitory for microbial saprotrophic growth.
   This work demonstrates that defining litter quality by C-13-CPMAS NMR
   improves our understanding of the substrate preferences of both plant
   and microbes for different litter types as well as for charred organic
   materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the ecology of coniferous forests is very important
   because these environments represent globally largest carbon sinks.
   Metatranscriptomics, microbial community and enzyme analyses were
   combined to describe the detailed role of microbial taxa in the
   functioning of the Picea abies-dominated coniferous forest soil in two
   contrasting seasons. These seasons were the summer, representing the
   peak of plant photosynthetic activity, and late winter, after an
   extended period with no photosynthate input. The results show that
   microbial communities were characterized by a high activity of fungi
   especially in litter where their contribution to microbial transcription
   was over 50\%. Differences in abundance between summer and winter were
   recorded for 26-33\% of bacterial genera and < 15\% of fungal genera,
   but the transcript profiles of fungi, archaea and most bacterial phyla
   were significantly different among seasons. Further, the seasonal
   differences were larger in soil than in litter. Most importantly, fungal
   contribution to total microbial transcription in soil decreased from
   33\% in summer to 16\% in winter. In particular, the activity of the
   abundant ectomycorrhizal fungi was reduced in winter, which indicates
   that plant photosynthetic production was likely one of the major drivers
   of changes in the functioning of microbial communities in this
   coniferous forest.}},

Title = {{Scale-dependent variation in nitrogen cycling and soil fungal
   communities along gradients of forest composition and age in
   regenerating tropical dry forests}},

Abstract = {{Rates of ecosystem nitrogen (N) cycling may be mediated by the presence
   of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which compete directly with free-living
   microbes for N. In the regenerating tropical dry forests of Central
   America, the distribution of ectomycorrhizal trees is affected by
   succession and soil parent material, both of which may exert independent
   influence over soil N fluxes.
   In order to quantify these interacting controls, we used a
   scale-explicit sampling strategy to examine soil N cycling at scales
   ranging from the microsite to ecosystem level. We measured fungal
   community composition, total and inorganic N pools, gross proteolytic
   rate, net N mineralization and microbial extracellular enzyme activity
   at multiple locations within 18 permanent plots that span dramatic
   gradients of soil N concentration, stand age and forest composition.
   The ratio of inorganic to organic N cycling was correlated with
   variation in fungal community structure, consistent with a strong
   influence of ectomycorrhiza on ecosystem-scale N cycling. However, on
   average, > 61\% of the variation in soil biogeochemistry occurred within
   plots, and the effects of forest composition were mediated by this
   local-scale heterogeneity in total soil N concentrations.
   These cross-scale interactions demonstrate the importance of a spatially
   explicit approach towards an understanding of controls on element
   cycling.}},
