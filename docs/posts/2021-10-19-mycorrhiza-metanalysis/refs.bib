@article{Averill2014,
abstract = {Soil contains more carbon than the atmosphere and vegetation combined. Understanding the mechanisms controlling the accumulation and stability of soil carbon is critical to predicting the Earth's future climate. Recent studies suggest that decomposition of soil organic matter is often limited by nitrogen availability to microbes and that plants, via their fungal symbionts, compete directly with free-living decomposers for nitrogen. Ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal (EEM) fungi produce nitrogen-degrading enzymes, allowing them greater access to organic nitrogen sources than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. This leads to the theoretical prediction that soil carbon storage is greater in ecosystems dominated by EEM fungi than in those dominated by AM fungi. Using global data sets, we show that soil in ecosystems dominated by EEM-associated plants contains 70% more carbon per unit nitrogen than soil in ecosystems dominated by AM-associated plants. The effect of mycorrhizal type on soil carbon is independent of, and of far larger consequence than, the effects of net primary production, temperature, precipitation and soil clay content. Hence the effect of mycorrhizal type on soil carbon content holds at the global scale. This finding links the functional traits of mycorrhizal fungi to carbon storage at ecosystem-to-global scales, suggesting that plant-decomposer competition for nutrients exerts a fundamental control over the terrestrial carbon cycle. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Borenstein2010,
abstract = {There are two popular statistical models for meta-analysis, the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model. The fact that these two models employ similar sets of formulas to compute statistics, and sometimes yield similar estimates for the various parameters, may lead people to believe that the models are interchangeable. In fact, though, the models represent fundamentally different assumptions about the data. The selection of the appropriate model is important to ensure that the various statistics are estimated correctly. Additionally, and more fundamentally, the model serves to place the analysis in context. It provides a framework for the goals of the analysis as well as for the interpretation of the statistics.In this paper we explain the key assumptions of each model, and then outline the differences between the models. We conclude with a discussion of factors to consider when choosing between the two models. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Mycelial strands also provide a pathway for the transport of physiologically significant quantities of water. Strand functions are examined in relation to structure, and their role as morphological and physiological extensions of the root system is emphasized.

abstract = {(Table presented.). Summary: The majority of vascular plants are mycorrhizal: 72% are arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM), 2.0% are ectomycorrhizal (EcM), 1.5% are ericoid mycorrhizal and 10% are orchid mycorrhizal. Just 8% are completely nonmycorrhizal (NM), whereas 7% have inconsistent NM–AM associations. Most NM and NM–AM plants are nutritional specialists (e.g. carnivores and parasites) or habitat specialists (e.g. hydrophytes and epiphytes). Mycorrhizal associations are consistent in most families, but there are exceptions with complex roots (e.g. both EcM and AM). We recognize three waves of mycorrhizal evolution, starting with AM in early land plants, continuing in the Cretaceous with multiple new NM or EcM linages, ericoid and orchid mycorrhizas. The third wave, which is recent and ongoing, has resulted in root complexity linked to rapid plant diversification in biodiversity hotspots.},

abstract = {Although it is increasingly being recognized that roots play a key role in soil carbon (C) dynamics, the magnitude and direction of these effects are unknown. Roots can accelerate soil C losses by provisioning microbes with energy to decompose organic matter or impede soil C losses by enhancing microbial competition for nutrients. We experimentally reduced belowground C supply to soils via tree girdling, and contrasted responses in control and girdled plots for three consecutive growing seasons. We hypothesized that decreases in belowground C supply would have stronger effects in plots dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees rather than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees. In ECM-dominated plots, girdling decreased the activity of enzymes that break down soil organic matter (SOM) by c. 40%, indicating that, in control plots, C supply from ECM roots primes microbial decomposition. In AM-dominated plots, girdling had little effect on SOM-degrading enzymes, but increased the decomposition of AM leaf litter by c. 43%, suggesting that, in control plots, AM roots may intensify microbial competition for nutrients. Our findings indicate that root-induced changes in soil processes depend on forest composition, and that shifts in the distribution of AM and ECM trees owing to climate change may determine soil C gains and losses.},

abstract = {When the first edition of The Handbook of Research Synthesis was published in 1994, it quickly became the definitive reference for researchers conducting meta-analyses of existing research in both the social and biological sciences. In this fully revised second edition, editors Harris Cooper, Larry Hedges, and Jeff Valentine present updated versions of the Handbook's classic chapters, as well as entirely new sections reporting on the most recent, cutting-edge developments in the field. Research synthesis is the practice of systematically distilling and integrating data from a variety of sources in order to draw more reliable conclusions about a given question or topic. The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis draws upon years of groundbreaking advances that have transformed research synthesis from a narrative craft into an important scientific process in its own right. Cooper, Hedges, and Valentine have assembled leading authorities in the field to guide the reader through every stage of the research synthesis process-problem formulation, literature search and evaluation, statistical integration, and report preparation. The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis incorporates state-of-the-art techniques from all quantitative synthesis traditions. Distilling a vast technical literature and many informal sources, the Handbook provides a portfolio of the most effective solutions to the problems of quantitative data integration. Among the statistical issues addressed by the authors are the synthesis of non-independent data sets, fixed and random effects methods, the performance of sensitivity analyses and model assessments, and the problem of missing data. The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis also provides a rich treatment of the non-statistical aspects of research synthesis. Topics include searching the literature, and developing schemes for gathering information from study reports. Those engaged in research synthesis will also find useful advice on how tables, graphs, and narration can be used to provide the most meaningful communication of the results of research synthesis. In addition, the editors address the potentials and limitations of research synthesis, and its future directions. The past decade has been a period of enormous growth in the field of research synthesis.

abstract = {1 An experimental multispecies screening of leaf decomposition rates was undertaken in order to identify and quantify general patterns in leaf decomposition rates in functional plant types and taxa. Functional species groups were characterized using whole-plant and whole-leaf features relevant to the functioning of plants in their natural environments. 2 The experiment included fresh leaf litters of 125 British vascular plant species, covering a wide range of life-forms, leaf habits and taxa. Preweighed litter samples were enclosed in two types of litter bags and exposed to natural weather conditions and soil-borne decomposers by burying them simultaneously in an experimental outdoor leaf-mould layer. 3 Relative litter dry weight losses showed largely similar patterns among species between both litter bag types, between 8 and 20-week burial periods in winter and between winter and summer burial. 4 Life-form, deciduous vs. evergreen habit, autumn coloration of leaf litter, family and evolutionary advancement sensu Sporne could each explain part of the variability in litter dry weight loss among species. The correlation with litter specific leaf area appeared confounded with taxonomy. 5 Some of these easy-to-assess predictors of species' relative leaf decomposition rates may prove useful for modelling soil decomposition rates under vegetations differing in species composition},

abstract = {Ecosystem carbon cycling depends strongly on the productivity of plant species and the decomposition rates of the litter they produce. We tested the hypothesis that classifying plant functional types according to mycorrhizal association explains important interspecific variation in plant carbon cycling traits, particularly in those traits that feature in a hypothesized feedback between vegetation productivity and litter turnover. We compared data from standardized 'screening' tests on inherent potential seedling relative growth rate (RGR), foliar nutrient concentrations, and leaf litter decomposability among 83 British plant species of known mycorrhizal type. There was important variation in these parameters between mycorrhizal plant types. Plant species with ericoid mycorrhiza showed consistently low inherent RGR, low foliar N and P concentrations, and poor litter decomposability; plant species with ectomycorrhiza had an intermediate RGR, higher foliar N and P, and intermediate to poor litter decomposability; plant species with arbuscular-mycorrhiza showed comparatively high RGR, high foliar N and P, and fast litter decomposition. Within the woody species subset, differentiation in RGR between mycorrhizal types was mostly confounded with deciduous versus evergreen habit, but the overall differentiation in litter mass loss between mycorrhizal types remained strong within each leaf habit. These results indicate that, within a representative subset of a temperate flora, ericoid and ectomycorrhizal strategies are linked with low and arbuscular-mycorrhizal species with high ecosystem carbon turnover. The incorporation of mycorrhizal association into current functional type classifications is a valuable tool in the assessment of plant-mediated controls on carbon and nutrient cycling.},

They are most common in eastern North America, western and central Europe, and northeastern Asia, where the climate is defi ned by warm summers, cold winters, and intermediate levels of precipitation. To a lesser extent, they are also present in this same climate in Australia, New Zealand, South America, and South Africa. Temperate forests are dominated by either deciduous or evergreen canopies. In temperate deciduous forests, more commonly found in the Northern Hemisphere, plants drop their leaves in autumn, allowing for high seasonal variation in light availability to the understory. By contrast, in temperate evergreen forests, which are more commonly found in the Southern Hemisphere, plants keep their leaves year round. The temperate forest biome is rich in geologic and anthropocentric history, with much of the land shaped by glacial and human activity. Located in some of the most industrialized places in the world, temperate forests have been instrumental to socioeconomic development in these regions. As a consequence, these forests have been heavily impacted by expanding human populations, which remain the primary continuous threat to the structure and function of these forests.},

Franco]}. Microbial biomass, needle decomposition rates, nutrient release from needles and exchangeable soil nutrients were measured in ectomycorrhizal mat soils and adjacent non-mat soils in a second-growth Douglas fir forest periodically throughout 1 yr. Microbial biomass and needle decomposition were 4.0 and 1.1 times higher, respectively, in mat soils than in adjacent non-mat soils during the year of sampling. After 1 yr of decomposition, needle litter concentrations of K and Mg decreased in both soil types, and release of both nutrients was greater in mats than in non-mat soils. Needle litter concentrations of Ca, Mn, Cu. Zn and Al increased during the year in both soil types, but nutrient absorption by needles tended to be highest in non-mat soils. Concentrations of N, P, Fe and B in needle litter did not change during the year, yet nearly twice as much N and P were released in mat soils compared to non-mat soils, suggesting either faster decomposition or nutrient import to mat soils. Soil solution concentrations of nh4, P, K, Mg and Zn measured by absorption onto ion-exchange resins, did not differ between mat and non-mat soils. Mat soils had higher concentrations of NO3, Fe, Cu and B but lower concentrations of Ca and Mn compared to non-mat soils. Nutrients released from the decomposing needles but not absorbed by ion-exchange resins must be rapidly removed from the soil solution either by plant roots, microbial tissue, saprophytic fungi or via ectomycorrhizal translocation to host trees. Our data suggest that the ectomycorrhizal fungus H. seichelli provides an improved microcnvironment for organic matter decomposition resulting in faster release of N, P, K, and Mg and more efficient removal of the nutrients from the soil solution. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {The effect of three collembolan species on decomposition and N mobilization was studied in a Pinus nigra plantation, using field enclosures and by trenching tree roots. The fauna were added to defaunated organic material. Estimates were made of weight and N losses from fresh litter, fragmented litter and humus after 7 months exposure. N mobilization was also measured as leachable mineral N using suction cup lysimcters. and was found to be dominated by NO3--N. In the presence of the surface dwelling Orcheselln cincta (L.) a net loss of 310 mmol m-2 of total N in humus was observed, as opposed to a small gain of 76 mmol N m-2 in the control. Tomocerus minor (Lubbock) induced a nearly two-fold increase in the mobilization of NO3--N to the leachate compared to Isotoma nolabilis Sch{\"{a}}ffer. possibly as a consequence of differences in grazing saprotrophic fungi. The influence of I. notabilis on the experimental systems differed from the effects of the other Collembola in effecting an increased mass loss of humus material. Tree roots suppressed fragmented litter decomposition significantly by 2.0%. and had considerable effect on N dynamics. In the presence of roots, leachable quantities of NO3--N were reduced to half the amounts that were collected in their absence. The amount of total-N of fragmented litter was nearly unchanged in non-rooted plots, but was reduced at a rale of 274 mmol m-2 after 7 months. It was concluded that C and N mineralization in soils is influenced by the ecological characteristics of the dominant species and is not simply a function of trophic group or biomass. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

While this phenomenon is widely cited, its generality remains unclear, as both the direction and magnitude of EM fungal effects on leaf litter decomposition have been shown to vary among studies. Here we explicitly examine how contrasting leaf litter types and EM fungal communities may lead to differential effects on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Specifically, we measured the response of soil nutrient cycling, litter decay rates, litter chemistry and fungal community structure to the reduction of EM fungi (via trenching) with a reciprocal litter transplant experiment in adjacent Pinus- or Quercus-dominated sites. We found clear evidence of EM fungal suppression of C and N cycling in the Pinus-dominated site, but no suppression in the Quercus-dominated site. Additionally, in the Pinus-dominated site, only the Pinus litter decay rates were decelerated by EM fungi and were associated with decoupling of litter C and N cycling. Our results support the hypothesis that EM fungi can decelerate C cycling via N competition, but strongly suggest that the ‘Gadgil effect' is dependent on both substrate quality and EM fungal community composition. We argue that understanding tree host traits as well as EM fungal functional diversity is critical to a more mechanistic understanding of how EM fungi mediate forest soil biogeochemical cycling.},

Eventhough there are other excellent books that deal with plant nutrition (e.g.,Barber 1995; Marschner 1995; Tinker and Nye 2000), a number of major differencesmake the content of this volume very timely.First, this volume does not deal with the broader concept of plant nutrition.Rather, the emphasis here is on factors that control plant nutrient acquisition.Recent methodological advances in the imaging of root growth, architectureand turnover, as well as isotope techniques, have rapidly filled theinformation gap that once hindered progress in our understanding of the patternsand mechanisms of nutrient acquisition by native terrestrial plants. Thisvolume reflects on many of those mechanisms and patterns. Second, and perhapsmore important, other books in this area often discuss nutrient uptakeby plants from an agronomic perspective. In contrast, the focus of this volumeis largely ecological. Consequently, many of the chapters discuss root systemcharacteristics that have evolved to cope with conditions that are only rarelyexperienced by crop plants, e.g., heterogeneity of soil nutrients in time andspace.Given the importance of the factors that control available nutrients at theroot surface, we devoted two chapters to soil nutrient bioavailability. Chapter1 deals with soil physiochemical factors and Chapter 2 with biogeochemicalnutrient cycling controlling the release of nutrients from soil organicreservoirs. Chapter 3 highlights soil spatial and temporal heterogeneity ofnutrient bioavailability.Nitrogen fixation and its contribution to soil N availabilityare covered in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 addresses the regulation of nutrientuptake by internal plant demand and use efficiency. The focus of theremaining chapters is on root characteristics, particularly those that are todate understudied, e.g., kinet{\ldots}},

abstract = {Trenching was used to reduce root activity in treeless plots in a New Mexico mixed-conifer forest to examine the effects of plant roots on soil processes. Trenching led to increases in moisture content (104%), inorganic N concentration (115%), and mass loss from cellulose (196%). In laboratory incubations, trenched soils collected in the 1st and 2nd year after trenching evolved 52% and 115% more CO2, respectively, than control soils. Amending incubated trenched and control soils with moisture and inorganic N indicated that increased soil moisture content in trenched plots could explain the increased microbial activity. Trenching also had statistically significant but inconsistent effects on net N mineralization in incubated soils. The greatest effect of trenching was to increase net N mineralization under favorable temperature and moisture conditions. Irrigation of field plots increased both CO2 evolution and net N mineralization. Overall, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that plant roots reduced microbial activity by moisture uptake during the time of the study. {\textcopyright} 1986 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Two experiments, designed to give more information about the suppression of litter decomposition by radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) roots and their associated microflora, were carried out. In the first, root activity was reduced by cutting the boundaries of small areas of the forest floor in an unthinned stand. Samples collected after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months showed that less litter accumulated in areas where root activity was reduced and that the development of mycelial mats in the litter was greatest where mycorrhizal roots were present. Soil moisture content was increased where treatment had involved soil disturbance, but no significant differences attributable to treatment were observed in net amounts of major nutrients or pH. In the second experiment, litter decomposition in the presence of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots was studied in the laboratory. Decomposition was slower when mycorrhizal roots were present. It was concluded that the presence of external mycelia of mycorrhizal fungi suppressed litter decomposition. The mechanism of suppression is not clear but moisture and pH did not play an important part in it. Competition for nutrients may have been involved. It is suggested that suppression of decomposi-tion by mycorrhizas may be a major factor in the formation of raw humus. INTRODUCTION Gadgil and Gadgil (1971) described an experiment in which the roots of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) were partially excluded from small areas of the forest floor. This showed that the presence of living roots of radiata pine and their associated biota suppressed litter decomposition in some way. In the area where the experiment was carried out, there was an intense development of mycorrhizal roots and of fungal mycelia which were shown to be associated with them. This is typical of raw litter of temperate coniferous forests (Melin, 1925; Romell, 1935; Harley, 1940; Meyer, 1964). The mechanism by which the living roots suppressed the activity of litter-decompos-ing organisms was not clear from the 1971 experiment. In a stand of this type where the upper soil layers are almost fully exploited, it can be assumed that the mycorrhizal root/fungus partnership is the dominant biotic influence in the soil of the main rooting zone. The reduced activity of the litter-decomposing organisms may therefore be the result of: (a) The mycorrhizal roots, their external mycelia, or both being more successful competitors for nutrients or moisture; (b) The exclusion of obligate saprophytes by direct physical or chemical antagonism by the mycorrhizal roots, their mycelia, or both.},

abstract = {Plant roots release recent photosynthates into the rhizosphere, accelerating decomposition of organic matter by saprotrophic soil microbes ('rhizosphere priming effect') which consequently increases nutrient availability for plants. However, about 90% of all higher plant species are mycorrhizal, transferring a significant fraction of their photosynthates directly to their fungal partners. Whether mycorrhizal fungi pass on plant-derived carbon (C) to bacteria in root-distant soil areas, i.e. incite a ‘hyphosphere priming effect', is not known. Experimental evidence for C transfer from mycorrhizal hyphae to soil bacteria is limited, especially for ectomycorrhizal systems. As ectomycorrhizal fungi possess enzymatic capabilities to degrade organic matter themselves, it remains unclear whether they cooperate with soil bacteria by providing photosynthates, or compete for available nutrients. To investigate a possible C transfer from ectomycorrhizal hyphae to soil bacteria, and its response to changing nutrient availability, we planted young beech trees (Fagus sylvatica) into ‘split-root' boxes, dividing their root systems into two disconnected soil compartments. Each of these compartments was separated from a litter compartment by a mesh penetrable for fungal hyphae, but not for roots. Plants were exposed to a 13C-CO2–labeled atmosphere, while 15N-labeled ammonium and amino acids were added to one side of the split-root system. We found a rapid transfer of recent photosynthates via ectomycorrhizal hyphae to bacteria in root-distant soil areas. Fungal and bacterial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers were significantly enriched in hyphae-exclusive compartments 24 h after 13C-CO2–labeling. Isotope imaging with nanometer-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) allowed for the first time in situ visualization of plant-derived C and N taken up by extraradical fungal hyphae, and in microbial cells thriving on hyphal surfaces. When N was added to the litter compartments, bacterial biomass and the amount of incorporated 13C strongly declined. Interestingly, this effect was also observed in adjacent soil compartments where added N was only available for bacteria through hyphal transport, indicating that ectomycorrhizal fungi were acting on soil bacteria. Together, our results demonstrate that (i) ectomycorrhizal hyphae rapidly transfer plant-derived C to bacterial communities in root-distant areas, and (ii) this transfer promptly responds to changing so{\ldots}},

Therefore, given this knowledge gap, our aim was to test how AMF influence the soil decomposer communities. Dual compartment microcosms, where AMF ( Glomus mosseae ) were either allowed access (AM+) to or excluded (AM−) from forest soil compartments containing litterbags (leaf litter from Calophyllum polyanthum ) were used. The experiment ran for six months, with destructive harvests at 0, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days. For each harvest we measured AMF colonization, soil nutrients, litter mass loss, and microbial biomass (using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA)). AMF significantly enhanced litter decomposition in the first 5 months, whilst delaying the development of total microbial biomass (represented by total PLFA) from T 150 to T 180 . A significant decline in soil available N was observed through the course of the experiment for both treatments. This study shows that AMF have the capacity to interact with soil microbial communities and inhibit the development of fungal and bacterial groups in the soil at the later stage of the litter decomposition (180 days), whilst enhancing the rates of decomposition.},

abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted on field-competition experiments published in six journals over a 10-yr period, analyzing the effects of competition on the biomass of organisms belonging to 93 species in a wide variety of habitats. Competition had a large effect overall, with a great deal of heterogeneity in that effect among organisms. There were large differences among trophic levels in competitive effects, but the relative magnitude of competition at different trophic levels was contrary to the predictions of ecological theory. Primary producers and carnivores displayed small to medium effects. In these two groups, interspecific effects did not differ from intraspecific effects, nor did effects differ in terrestrial versus aquatic habitats. The effects of competition on herbivores ranged from large effects on anurans and lotic arthropods, to medium effects on marine mollusks and echinoderms, to effects that were not statistically distinguishable from zero for terrestrial arthopods. Interspecific competitive effects among these herbivore groups were generally less than intraspecific effects. Among primary producers, the effects of competition were not different in high- and low-productivity habitats. Across all taxa, large organisms did not experience greater competitive effects than small organisms, and competitive effects did not depend on the size attained in the absence of competitors. The effects of competition were weakly density-dependent in cases in which it was possible to examine the effects of the density of neighbors. -from Authors},

abstract = {Reliable synthesis of the various rapidly expanding bodies of evidence is vital for the process of evidence-informed decision-making in environmental policy, practice and research. With the rise of evidence-base medicine and increasing numbers of published systematic reviews, criteria for assessing the quality of reporting have been developed. First QUOROM (Lancet 354:1896-1900, 1999) and then PRISMA (Ann Intern Med 151:264, 2009) were developed as reporting guidelines and standards to ensure medical meta-analyses and systematic reviews are reported to a high level of detail. PRISMA is now widely used by a range of journals as a pre-submission checklist. However, due to its development for systematic reviews in healthcare, PRISMA has limited applicability for reviews in conservation and environmental management. We highlight 12 key problems with the application of PRISMA to this field, including an overemphasis on meta-analysis and no consideration for other synthesis methods. We introduce ROSES (RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses), a pro forma and flow diagram designed specifically for systematic reviews and systematic maps in the field of conservation and environmental management. We describe how ROSES solves the problems with PRISMA. We outline the key benefits of our approach to designing ROSES, in particular the level of detail and inclusion of rich guidance statements. We also introduce the extraction of meta-data that describe key aspects of the conduct of the review. Collated together, this summary record can help to facilitate rapid review and appraisal of the conduct of a systematic review or map, potentially speeding up the peer-review process. We present the results of initial road testing of ROSES with systematic review experts, and propose a plan for future development of ROSES.},

abstract = {Almost all land plants form symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal fungi. These below-ground fungi play a key role in terrestrial ecosystems as they regulate nutrient and carbon cycles, and influence soil structure and ecosystem multifunctionality. Up to 80% of plant N and P is provided by mycorrhizal fungi and many plant species depend on these symbionts for growth and survival. Estimates suggest that there are c. 50 000 fungal species that form mycorrhizal associations with c. 250 000 plant species. The development of high-throughput molecular tools has helped us to better understand the biology, evolution, and biodiversity of mycorrhizal associations. Nuclear genome assemblies and gene annotations of 33 mycorrhizal fungal species are now available providing fascinating opportunities to deepen our understanding of the mycorrhizal lifestyle, the metabolic capabilities of these plant symbionts, the molecular dialogue between symbionts, and evolutionary adaptations across a range of mycorrhizal associations. Large-scale molecular surveys have provided novel insights into the diversity, spatial and temporal dynamics of mycorrhizal fungal communities. At the ecological level, network theory makes it possible to analyze interactions between plant-fungal partners as complex underground multi-species networks. Our analysis suggests that nestedness, modularity and specificity of mycorrhizal networks vary and depend on mycorrhizal type. Mechanistic models explaining partner choice, resource exchange, and coevolution in mycorrhizal associations have been developed and are being tested. This review ends with major frontiers for further research.},

abstract = {We investigated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) alteration of microbial mediation of litter decomposition. AMF (Glomus hoi) were either allowed access to or excluded from Plantago lanceolata L. root litter embedded in soil; litter was labeled with either 13C only or 13C and 15N. Plant N uptake was significantly increased if AMF accessed the litter, and 15N analysis of the plant material indicated that 2-3% of plant N originated from litter. Succession of the soil community mediating decomposition was assessed by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) combined with 13C-PLFA. During the first 21 days of decomposition, saprotrophic fungi and Gram-negative bacteria were the dominant consumers of litter C. As decomposition progressed however, 13C content of the fungal biomarkers declined substantially, and Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria became the primary reservoirs of labeled litter C. The putative PLFA marker for AMF (16:1$\omega$5c) originated primarily from non-AMF sources. In AMF-invaded root litter, Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and 16:1$\omega$5c markers became less 13C-enriched relative to their counterparts in non-AMF-invaded microcosms during active decomposition. These patterns of 13C: 12C enrichment may result from AMF supply of 12C from the plant to the decomposing soil microbial community; such C inputs could alter the microbial mediation of litter decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

abstract = {The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the X2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of H that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

It is thought that they possess no degradative capability and that they are unable to decompose complex organic molecules, the form in which most soil nutrients occur. Earlier suggestions that they could exist saprotrophically were based on observation of hyphal proliferation on organic materials. In contrast, other mycorrhizal types have been shown to acquire nitrogen directly from organic sources.

abstract = {A large-scale tree-girdling experiment enabled estimates in the field of the contribution of extramatrical mycelium of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi to soil microbial biomass and by ECM roots and fungi to production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Tree-girdling was made early (EG) or late (LG) during the summer to terminate the flow of photosynthate to roots and ECM fungi. Determination of microbial C (Cmicr) and microbial N in root-free organic soil was performed by using the fumigation-extraction technique; extractable DOC was determined on unfumigated soil. Soil Cmicr was 41% lower on LG than on control plots 1 month after LG, whereas at the same time (that is, 3 months after EG), the Cmicr was 23% lower on EG than on control plots. Extractable DOC was 45% lower on girdled plots than control plots. Our results, which are of particular interest as they were obtained directly in the field, clearly demonstrate the important contribution by extramatrical ECM mycelium to soil microbial biomass and by ECM roots to the production of DOC, a carbon source for other microbes. {\textcopyright} New Phytologist (2002).},

abstract = {Background and aims: Belowground C supply from plant roots may accelerate the decomposition of SOM through the rhizosphere priming effect, but the detailed interaction between substrate quality and rhizosphere C supply is poorly understood. We hypothesize that decomposition of organic matter is enhanced by the combined effect of assimilate C supply to the rhizosphere and substrate amendments. Methods: Birch trees (Betula pendula) planted in experimental mesocosms; half of these trees were shaded to reduce the supply of assimilate C to roots and ECM fungi. Either 13C-enriched glucose, straw, fungal necromass or C4 biochar were subsequently added to each mesocosm. CO2 efflux derived from substrates were separated from that derived from native SOM and roots based on the isotopic composition of total respired CO2. Results: The addition of all substrates increased fluxes in both un-shaded and shaded treatments, with greatest total CO2 efflux observed in soils amended with straw. Increases in un-labelled CO2 were observed to be greater in the presence of belowground C supply than in mesocosms with shaded trees. Conclusions: Turnover of SOM is closely linked to belowground C allocation. The biochemical quality and recalcitrance of litter entering the soil C pool is of critical importance to this priming, as is the interaction with rhizosphere-associated decomposition activity.},

Ectomycorrhizal fungi have a reduced complement of genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), as compared to their ancestral wood decayers. Nevertheless, they have retained a unique array of PCWDEs, thus suggesting that they possess diverse abilities to decompose lignocellulose. Similar functional categories of nonorthologous genes are induced in symbiosis. Of induced genes, 7-38% are orphan genes, including genes that encode secreted effector-like proteins. Convergent evolution of the mycorrhizal habit in fungi occurred via the repeated evolution of a 'symbiosis toolkit', with reduced numbers of PCWDEs and lineage-specific suites of mycorrhiza-induced genes.},

The relative proportion of morphotypes was significantly different in litter and F-layer material buried at the same depth in the forest floor. • We conclude that the negative effect of ectomycorrhizas on decomposition could be mediated by extraction of water, particularly in relatively dry years. The 'Gadgil effect' may be explained by this phenomenon. In wetter years, water extraction may be less consequential. Also, variation in substrate quality may influence the structure of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities.},

We incubated four species of leaf litter within these plots in areas with reduced access to roots and mycorrhizal fungi and in adjacent areas with intact roots and mycorrhizal fungi. ●Over a period of 608 d, we found that litter decayed more rapidly in the presence of fine roots and mycorrhizal hyphae regardless of the dominant tree mycorrhizal association. Root and mycorrhizal exclusion reduced the activity of acid phosphatase on decomposing litter. ●Our results indicate that both AM- and ECM-associated fine roots stimulate litter decomposition in this system. These findings suggest that the effect of fine roots and mycorrhizal fungi on litter decay in a particular ecosystem likely depends on whether interactions between mycorrhizal roots and saprotrophic fungi are antagonistic or facilitative.},

abstract = {Extraradical mycelia of mycorrhizal fungi are normally the “hidden half” of the symbiosis, but they are powerful underground influences upon biogeochemical cycling, the composition of plant communities, and agroecosystem functioning. Mycorrhizal mycelial networks are the most dynamic and functionally diverse components of the symbiosis, and recent estimates suggest they are empowered by receiving as much as 10% or more of the net photosynthate of their host plants. They often constitute 20%–30% of total soil microbial biomass yet are undetected by standard measures of biomass used by soil scientists and agromomists. Mycorrhizal mycelia provide extensive pathways for carbon and nutrient fluxes through soil, often exceeding tens of metres per gram of soil. We consider the amounts of photosynthate “power” allocated to these mycelial networks and how this is used in fungal respiration, biomass, and growth and in influencing soil, plant, and ecosystem processes. The costs and functional “benefits” to plants linking to these networks are fungal specific and, because of variations in physiology and host specificity, are not shared equally; some plants even depend exclusively on these networks for carbon. We briefly assess the potential contribution of extraradical mycorrhizal mycelium to sustainable agriculture and maintenance of biodiversity and highlight technologies that promise new vistas and improved fine-scale resolution of the dynamic spatial and temporal functioning of these networks in soil.Key words: arbuscular mycorrhiza, ectomycorrhiza, extraradical mycelium, hyphal networks.},

abstract = {The decomposition of plant organic matter and the stability of soil aggregates are important components of soil carbon cycling, and the relationship between decomposition rate and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has recently received considerable attention. The interaction of AMF with their associated microorganisms and the consequences for litter decomposition and soil aggregation still remain fairly unclear. In a laboratory pot experiment we simultaneously tested the single and combined effects of one AMF species (Rhizophagus irregularis) and a natural non-AMF microbial community on the decomposition of small wooden sticks and on soil aggregation. To disentangle effects of hyphae and roots we placed mesh bags as root exclusion compartments in the soil. The decomposition of the wooden sticks in this compartment was significantly reduced in the presence of AMF, but not with the non-AMF microbial community only, compared to the control, while aggregation was increased in all treatments compared to the control. We suggest that AMF directly (via localized nutrient removal or altered moisture conditions) or indirectly (by providing an alternative carbon source) inhibited the activity of decomposers, leading to different levels of plant litter degradation under our experimental settings. Reduced decomposition of woody litter in presence of AMF can be important for nutrient cycling in AMF-dominated forests and in the case of woody plants and perennials that develop lignified roots in grasslands.},

In contrast, the less common monodominant rain forests, in which one tree species comprises more than 50% of the canopy, frequently contain ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associates. In this study, I explored the potential for common ECM networks, created by aggregations of ECM trees, to enhance seedling survivorship near parent trees. I determined the benefit conferred by the common ECM network on seedling growth and survivorship of an ECM monodominant species in Guyana. Seedlings with access to an ECM network had greater growth (73% greater), leaf number (55% more), and survivorship (47% greater) than seedlings without such access, suggesting that the ECM network provides a survivorship advantage. A survey of wild seedlings showed positive distance-dependent distribution and survival with respect to conspecific adults. These experimental and survey results suggest that the negative distance-dependent mechanisms at the seedling stage thought to maintain tropical rain forest diversity are reversed for ECM seedlings, which experience positive feedbacks from the ECM network.

abstract = {Soil microbial communities are so vastly diverse that complex interactions, which alter ecosystem functions, may occur among microbial species and functional groups. In this review, we explore the empirical evidence for situations when shifts in the community structure of microbes would elicit a change in ecosystem process rates, specifically decomposition, even when microbial biomass remains constant. In particular, we are interested in a subset of these scenarios in which knowledge of microbial community structure would improve model predictions for ecosystem functions. Results from microcosm and field studies indicate that microbial species diversity, functional group diversity, and community composition can all influence ecosystem process rates. The underlying mechanisms that may elicit changes in ecosystem functions from shifts in microbial community structure include evolutionary constraints on microbial trait adaptation, trait correlations, dispersal limitation, and species interactions. The extent of microbial diversity in soils is not known, so it is presently not possible to model all scenarios of microbial community structure shifts. However, by incorporating documented patterns in functional groups that are relevant for a particular ecosystem process and potential relationships between microbial phylogeny and function, the predictive power of process models will be significantly improved. The inclusion of this information into process models is critical for predicting and understanding how ecosystem functions may shift in response to global change. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. In order to develop a general model of litter decomposition rates suitable for the prediction of regional variations in decay rates, and to determine the relative control by macroclimate and litter quality on decomposition rates, data were selected from 5 locations ranging in climate from subpolar to warm temperate. Actual evapotranspiration (AET) was selected as an index of the climatic (energy and moisture) forcing function of the specialized decomposers which is superior to temper-ature and precipitation. Lignin concentration was selected as an index of litter quality and may be treated as a mediator of climatically (AET) regulated decay rates. In a stepwise, multiple linear correlation-regression, using AET, lignin concentration (%) and AET/lignin concentration (interac-tion), AET alone accounted for 51% of the variance in observed decay rates, AET/lignin concentration (interaction) added l9Wo and lignin concentration added 2% of the total (72%) variance accounted. Simple correlation of the five locations between lignin concentration and decomposition rate ranged from r = .32 to r = .95, however, the regression lines for each of the 5 locations indicated that these slopes progressively declined with AET. Moreover, the slope decline was not parallel, indicating a climatically variable control by lignin concentration on decay rates. In low-AET (not arid) climates, litter with high and low lignin, will decay at more nearly similar rates, but as the AET environment increases, the difference in decay rates becomes progressively greater than the increase in AET alone would seem to warrant. A general model of the interaction control by AET and lignin concentration on decomposition rates was formulated which overcomes the restraints of the multiple regression model. At the scale of subpolar to warm-temperate climates, the climate as indicated by AET is several orders of magnitude more important as a predictor of decay rate than is litter quality. This importance is evident in spite of the fact that the data on lignin concentration used in this analysis had a 12-fold range while the AET values had a 2.3-fold range.},

abstract = {Real food webs are dynamic multi-dimensional systems, whereas the descriptions of real food webs often do not capture this complexity in that they have been confined to a single habitat (the community web sensu Cohen, 1978) and do not represent changes in time (Paine, 1988). We present an analytical approach that uses univariate and multivariate statistics and simulation modeling to study pattern within food webs. As an illustration of the approach, we compared below-ground food webs from natural and agricultural ecosystems in terms of their architecture, temporal dynamics of the biomass of functional groups, and the temporal and spatial dynamics of energy channels. The complexity and diversity of below-ground food webs are similar to the detritus-based food webs of other terrestrial and aquatic habitats. The pattern of the flow of nitrogen through the below-ground food webs of the Shortgrass Steppe of North America is similar to that of the food web of agricultural soils of reclaimed marine sediments in The Netherlands. The webs are compartmented along dominant flows of energy (energy channels) originating from primary production and detritus. Comparisons of the connectedness descriptions, and implementations of cluster analysis, canonical discriminant analysis and analysis of variance of temporal biomass of functional groups within food webs of soils from North America and The Netherlands, indicate that the detritus energy channel can be further compartmented into a fungal and bacterial channel. For winter wheat soils in The Netherlands, the degree of compartmentalization appears to depend on management practice. Consumers of fungi were separated in time from consumers of bacteria in the integrated management practice, while little separation was observed in conventional practice. Our study indicates (1) that analyses of food webs should aim to project the web onto the principal niche dimensions food, habitat and time, and (2) that quantitative measures of community structure - identification of functional groups, the biomass and productivity of functional groups, and the flow of nutrients within energy channels - are useful measures of food web structure. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

We also estimate a source of 1.3 ± 0.7 Pg C year–1 from tropical land-use change, consisting of a gross tropical deforestation emission of 2.9 ± 0.5 Pg C year–1 partially compensated by a carbon sink in tropical forest regrowth of 1.6 ± 0.5 Pg C year–1. Together, the fluxes comprise a net global forest sink of 1.1 ± 0.8 Pg C year–1, with tropical estimates having the largest uncertainties. Our total forest sink estimate is equivalent in magnitude to the terrestrial sink deduced from fossil fuel emissions and land-use change sources minus ocean and atmospheric sinks.},

Root quantity was manipulated by varying plant density (0, 1, 2, or 4 seedlings) and rhizosphere soil was separated from non-rhizosphere soil by a 1.2 $\mu$m mesh fabric. In the rhizosphere of organic soil horizons, moisture, microbial growth rate, biomass C and N, and extractable N declined as root density was increased, but there was little effect on nematodes or microarthropods. High levels of extractable N remained after 5 months, suggesting that N mineralization was stimulated during the incubation. In the rhizosphere of mineral soil horizons, microbial growth rate, and nematode and microarthropod abundances increased at higher root density, and in the absence of roots faunal abundance approached zero. Faunal activity was concentrated in the rhizosphere compared to non-rhizosphere soil. In organic soil horizons, roots may limit microbial activity by reducing soil moisture and/or N availability. However, in mineral soil horizons, where nutrient levels are very low, root inputs can stimulate microbial growth and faunal abundance by providing important substrates for microbial growth. Our results demonstrate a rhizosphere effect for soil fauna in the mineral soil, and thus extends the rhizosphere concept to components of the soil community other than microbes for forest ecosystems. Although our results need to be verified by field manipulations, we suggest that the effects of pine roots on nutrient cycling processes in coniferous forests can vary with soil nutrient content and, therefore, position in the soil profile.},

abstract = {Understanding the context dependence of ecosystem responses to global changes requires the development of new conceptual frameworks. Here we propose a framework for considering how tree species and their mycorrhizal associates differentially couple carbon (C) and nutrient cycles in temperate forests. Given that tree species predominantly associate with a single type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi), and that the two types of fungi differ in their modes of nutrient acquisition, we hypothesize that the abundance of AM and ECM trees in a plot, stand, or region may provide an integrated index of biogeochemical transformations relevant to C cycling and nutrient retention. First, we describe how forest plots dominated by AM tree species have nutrient economies that differ in their C-nutrient couplings from those in plots dominated by ECM trees. Secondly, we demonstrate how the relative abundance of AM and ECM trees can be used to estimate nutrient dynamics across the landscape. Finally, we describe how our framework can be used to generate testable hypotheses about forest responses to global change factors, and how these dynamics can be used to develop better representations of plant-soil feedbacks and nutrient constraints on productivity in ecosystem and earth system models. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

Because of wide range of relationships with host plants, it becomes difficult to identify the species on the morphological bases as the spores are to be extracted from the soil. In spite of their abundance and wide range of relationship with plant species, AMF have shown low species diversity. AMF have high functional diversity because different combinations of host plants and AMF have different effects on the numerous aspects of symbiosis. Recent fossil evidence has dated the appearance of arbuscular mycorrhizae back to 460 million years, preexisting vascular plants. These studies benefit the paleoecological importance of mycorrhizae and enhancement to our understanding of the evolution of mutualisms.},

Out of 19 isolates of ectomycorrhizal fungi tested for inhibition of the growth of P. ultimum, 16 caused swelling and bursting of the tips of leading hyphae. These effects were eliminated by maintaining the culture medium at pH 6 with a biological buffer. This indicated that acidification of the medium was the cause of the inhibition. Hyphal growth of P. ultimum was inhibited below pH 3. In liquid culture, the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus reduced the pH of the medium to less than 3 before it reached stationary phase. It is suggested that the antibiotic effect exhibited by some ectomycorrhizal fungi is due to acid production. HPLC analyses of culture filtrates of Pax. involutus were shown not to contain significant amounts of oxalic acid, but other acids were present in large quantities. {\textcopyright} 1992, British Mycological Society.

abstract = {Leaf-litter decomposition is a central process in carbon cycling; however, our knowledge about the microbial regulation of this process is still scarce. Metaproteomics allows us to link the abundance and activity of enzymes during nutrient cycling to their phylogenetic origin based on proteins, the active building blocks in the system. Moreover, we employed metaproteomics to investigate the influence of environmental factors and nutrients on the decomposer structure and function during beech litter decomposition. Litter was collected at forest sites in Austria with different litter nutrient content. Proteins were analyzed by 1-D-SDS-PAGE followed by liquid-chromatography and tandem mass-spectrometry. Mass spectra were assigned to phylogenetic and functional groups by a newly developed bioinformatics workflow, assignments being validated by complementary approaches. We provide evidence that the litter nutrient content and the stoichiometry of C:N:P affect the decomposer community structure and activity. Fungi were found to be the main producers of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, with no bacterial hydrolases being detected by our metaproteomics approach. Detailed investigation of microbial succession suggests that it is influenced by litter nutrient content. Microbial activity was stimulated at higher litter nutrient contents via a higher abundance and activity of extracellular enzymes. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal fungi are thought to have a key role in mobilizing organic nitrogen that is trapped in soil organic matter (SOM). However, the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi decompose SOM and the mechanism by which they do so remain unclear, considering that they have lost many genes encoding lignocellulose-degrading enzymes that are present in their saprotrophic ancestors. Spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome profiling were used to examine the mechanisms by which five species of ectomycorrhizal fungi, representing at least four origins of symbiosis, decompose SOM extracted from forest soils. In the presence of glucose and when acquiring nitrogen, all species converted the organic matter in the SOM extract using oxidative mechanisms. The transcriptome expressed during oxidative decomposition has diverged over evolutionary time. Each species expressed a different set of transcripts encoding proteins associated with oxidation of lignocellulose by saprotrophic fungi. The decomposition 'toolbox' has diverged through differences in the regulation of orthologous genes, the formation of new genes by gene duplications, and the recruitment of genes from diverse but functionally similar enzyme families. The capacity to oxidize SOM appears to be common among ectomycorrhizal fungi. We propose that the ancestral decay mechanisms used primarily to obtain carbon have been adapted in symbiosis to scavenge nutrients instead.},

abstract = {The identity of the dominant root-associated microbial symbionts in a forest determines the ability of trees to access limiting nutrients from atmospheric or soil pools1,2, sequester carbon3,4 and withstand the effects of climate change5,6. Characterizing the global distribution of these symbioses and identifying the factors that control this distribution are thus integral to understanding the present and future functioning of forest ecosystems. Here we generate a spatially explicit global map of the symbiotic status of forests, using a database of over 1.1 million forest inventory plots that collectively contain over 28,000 tree species. Our analyses indicate that climate variables—in particular, climatically controlled variation in the rate of decomposition—are the primary drivers of the global distribution of major symbioses. We estimate that ectomycorrhizal trees, which represent only 2% of all plant species7, constitute approximately 60% of tree stems on Earth. Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis dominates forests in which seasonally cold and dry climates inhibit decomposition, and is the predominant form of symbiosis at high latitudes and elevation. By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees dominate in aseasonal, warm tropical forests, and occur with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate biomes in which seasonally warm-and-wet climates enhance decomposition. Continental transitions between forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal trees occur relatively abruptly along climate-driven decomposition gradients; these transitions are probably caused by positive feedback effects between plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic nitrogen fixers—which are insensitive to climatic controls on decomposition (compared with mycorrhizal fungi)—are most abundant in arid biomes with alkaline soils and high maximum temperatures. The climatically driven global symbiosis gradient that we document provides a spatially explicit quantitative understanding of microbial symbioses at the global scale, and demonstrates the critical role of microbial mutualisms in shaping the distribution of plant species. A spatially explicit global map of tree symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi reveals that climate variables are the primary drivers of the distribution of different types of symbiosis.},

To test this idea, we coupled an optimality-based plant nitrogen (N) acquisition model with a microbe-focused soil organic matter (SOM) model. The model accurately predicted rhizosphere processes and C–N dynamics across a gradient of stands varying in their relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees. When mycorrhizal dominance was switched – ECM trees dominating plots previously occupied by AM trees, and vice versa – legacy effects were apparent, with consequences for both C and N stocks in soil. Under elevated productivity, ECM trees enhanced decomposition more than AM trees via microbial priming of unprotected SOM. Collectively, our results show that ecosystem responses to global change may hinge on the balance between rhizosphere priming and SOM protection, and highlight the importance of dynamically linking plants and microbes in terrestrial biosphere models.},

@article{Zhang2008,
abstract = {Aims We aim to construct a comprehensive global database of litter decomposition rate (k value) estimated by surface floor litterbags, and investigate the direct and indirect effects of impact factors such as geographic factors (latitude and altitude), climatic factors (mean annual tempePlrature, MAT; mean annual precipitation, MAP) and litter quality factors (the contents of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and C:N ratio, lignin:N ratio) on litter decomposition. Methods We compiled a large data set of litter decomposition rates (k values) from 110 research sites and conducted simple, multiple regression and path analyses to explore the relationship between the k values and impact factors at the global scale. Important findings The k values tended to decrease with latitude (LAT) and lignin content (LIGN) of litter but increased with temperature, precipitation and nutrient concentrations at the large spatial scale. Single factor such as climate, litter quality and geographic variable could not explain litter decomposition rates well. However, the combination of total nutrient (TN) elements and C:N accounted for 70.2% of the variation in the litter decomposition rates. The combination of LAT, MAT, C:N and TN accounted for 87.54% of the variation in the litter decomposition rates. These results indicate that litter quality is the most important direct regulator of litter decomposition at the global scale. This data synthesis revealed significant relationships between litter decomposition rates and the combination of climatic factor (MAT) and litter quality (C:N, TN). The global-scale empirical relationships developed here are useful for a better understanding and modeling of the effects of litter quality and climate factors on litter decompsotion rates.},

@article{Zhu1996,
abstract = {We studied the effects of mycorrhizal pitch pine (Pinus rigida) roots on litter decomposition, microbial biomass, nematode abundance and inorganic nutrients in the E horizon material of a spodosolic soil, using field microcosms created in a regenerating pitch pine stand in the New Jersey Pinelands. Pine roots stimulated litter decomposition by 18.7% by the end of the 29 month study. Both mass loss and N and P release from the litter were always higher in the presence of roots than in their absence. Nutrient concentrations in decomposing litter were similar, however, in the presence and absence of roots, which suggests that the roots present in the with-root treatment did not withdraw nutrients directly from the litter. The soil was slightly drier in the presence of roots, but there was no discernible effect on soil microbial biomass. The effects of roots on soil extractable inorganic nutrients were inconsistent. Roots, however, were consistently associated with higher numbers of soil nematodes. These results suggest that, in soils with low total C and N contents, roots stimulate greater activity of the soil biota, which contribute, in turn, to faster litter decomposition and nutrient release. {\textcopyright} 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},
